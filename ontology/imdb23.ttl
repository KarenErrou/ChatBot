	schema:reviewBody "Frank Capra's idealistic outlook on life is evident in his films. From It Happened One Night to It's a Wonderful Life Capra has always had a tendency to let the little guy rise above it all and beat the odds. It is no small wonder that Capra enjoyed much of his success during the Depression when movies were used to truly pull an audience out of the despair of the 1930s into a world where anything can happen where being a nice person is all you need to succeed. While the fact that the country was in the middle of the Depression was not completely ignored an overly optimistic view on life was taken to counter the despair of everyday life.There were many points in It Happened One Night where the true state of the country was indicated. Homeless people hitching rides on trains seemed perfectly normal. Rather than regard them with apprehension and pity you smile and wave at them. Another example is the hostile reaction proprietor Zeke's wife had to the fact that her husband had let Peter and Ellie stay the night with promises of being paid. Upon seeing Peter and Ellie's car missing they rush to the cottage to see if Peter and Ellie are still there. They cannot afford freeloaders.In another scene a child's mother has passed out from hunger because they have no money to buy food. Peter and Ellie have nearly depleted their funds but decide that the mother and child need money more than they do and give some to them.Despite these instances the movie was altogether cheerful in its depiction of the world. In the throes of the stock market crash this movie signaled the birth of the screwball comedy. At a time when the country needed release they could find that release and laughter in movies like It Happened One Night. Audiences were amused by scenes in the film such as the segment in which Peter teaches Ellie how to dunk a donut. Or when forced to share a room Peter puts a blanket between his and Ellie's beds and calls it the wall of Jericho' which is revisited when the walls of Jericho come tumbling down after Peter and Ellie's marriage. Probably the most famous scene in the film is the hitchhiking sequence which features Peter standing by the roadside trying to thumb a ride unsuccessfully finally giving up after more than a dozen cars speed by without paying any heed to his attempts. After he gives up beaten Ellie simply lifts her skirt above her knee. The first car that passes stops as we see extreme closeups of a foot slamming down on the brakes and a hand applying the hand brake.A master in his profession Capra left his mark on the films he directed. With an almost childlike cheerfulness he maintains a sense of dignity and class. The viewer is left with a feeling of hope for humankind even if its only that a person's ideals could be used to make such a film. Capra's films are still regarded as masterpieces. It Happened One Night arguably remains to this day unparalleled in screwball comedies. It was one of many movies made during the Depression a sometimes sad and even lonely time in our history. It gave its audience a chance to escape and forget their troubles for a few moments in time.9 out of 10 stars".

	schema:headline " A fantastic Capra film.";
	schema:reviewBody "It Happened One Night directed by Frank Capra was made and released in 1934 by Columbia Pictures as a small budget film that was not expected to do well at the box office. Yet after its release the film gained many accolades and won the Academy Award for best picture in 1934. Due to the original small nature of the film the leading man role was surprisingly filled by Clark Gable who was on loan from another studio. He stared opposite of Claudette Colbert. Capra's film was a combination of many ideals emotions and social perceptions of the American society of the thirties but it was also a combination of many new and innovative filming techniques and sound advancements. The film unfolds the story in such a attentiongrabbing and remarkable way that most of today's cinema use his style and ideals when producing and creating films. Capra used the idea of a moving camera one that was not fixed upon a box but on a moveable crane instead. This produced more sweeping shots more angles for filming and fewer distance shots. It allowed for more movement of the actors as well as a more realistic and real life feeling to the movie. The film also incorporates back projection of images. This is were a scene is filmed previously and played in the background while the actors perform the scene in front of the projection. Back projection is used for car scenes to give the impression that the actors are driving but in reality they are in a sound stage. Capra also incorporated the use of a wipe in his film. The technique of moving left to right and fading in or out to change a scene or show elapsed time took the place of the traditional place cards in silent films and allowed for a more constant stream for the film. The film was also all talk the new technology of a sound strip on the side of the film was used. The text cards of silent films were completely discarded. Another camera trick by Capra is to show a change in feelings within Clark Gable's character for Claudette Colbert's character by depicting her character in a different light. This happens two times within the film at key moments to the development of their relationship. Claudette Colbert is seen in a close up of softer light to emphasize Clark Gable's character seeing her in a different light.' In this romantic comedy Capra not only showed new styles and techniques but also addressed social issues of the time. Through comedy he showed the outlandish nature of the rich King arriving for his own wedding in a helicopter and the nature of man being the controller in relationships as well as in society. The fighting and struggles between the two main characters showed the man taking care of the woman the social norms of how men and woman should act around each other in that era. But the fighting and the banter also show a strongminded and intelligent woman. The two strongwilled main characters balanced each other out.Capra's techniques for showing the social relationship between the rich and working classes as well as a relationship between man and woman in the 1930s captured film makers and film viewers for over 70 years. Films are now compared to his style of camera movement and his style of capturing the American ideals. When movies of today make a similar statement of achieving what one wants they are referred to as Capraesc. Capra's imagination and style is one that changed the outlook of American films and introduced a new genre to film goers everywhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "IHON rightly earns it's place as one of the greatest romantic comedies in film history. A pioneer of the screwball comedy genre it holds up very well 71 years after it was made.It's a classic tale of the battle of sexes something that is still so relevant today. We follow the story of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews Claudette Colbert who jumps ship from her father's yacht literally! in Florida after an argument with said father played by Walter Connolly over her marrying wealthy playboy King Westley Jameson Thomas without her father's consent. Ellie is on a mission to get to New York to King Westley. But how will she do it? That's how Peter Warne played by a delightfully handsome Clark Gable comes into the story. Recently fired from his newspaper job Peter meets Ellie on the Night Bus to New York and realizing who she is Her story is all over the news after all! offers to help her get to NY and Westley if she gives him an exclusive story to win him back his job. And so the fun begins. Colbert and Gable have great chemistry as the mismatched couple thrown together after a series of unusual circumstances. The trip isn't a smooth one and we are taken on a wild ride with Peter and Ellie which gives us great scenes such as the doughnutdunking lesson Walls Of Jericho and the nowclassic hitchhiking scene. The humour is still fresh and fastpaced over 70 years later. Oops I almost forgot the classic 'no undershirt scene' where Gable sexily gives Colbert a lesson in how a man undresses to reveal shock horror! no undershirt but a bare chest! This had a bad effect on the sales of men's undershirts which dropped dramatically after the film's release One of the first examples of product placement in film.

	onyx:emotionText "IHON rightly earns it's place as one of the greatest romantic comedies in film history. A pioneer of the screwball comedy genre it holds up very well 71 years after it was made.It's a classic tale of the battle of sexes something that is still so relevant today. We follow the story of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews Claudette Colbert who jumps ship from her father's yacht literally! in Florida after an argument with said father played by Walter Connolly over her marrying wealthy playboy King Westley Jameson Thomas without her father's consent. Ellie is on a mission to get to New York to King Westley. But how will she do it? That's how Peter Warne played by a delightfully handsome Clark Gable comes into the story. Recently fired from his newspaper job Peter meets Ellie on the Night Bus to New York and realizing who she is Her story is all over the news after all! offers to help her get to NY and Westley if she gives him an exclusive story to win him back his job. And so the fun begins. Colbert and Gable have great chemistry as the mismatched couple thrown together after a series of unusual circumstances. The trip isn't a smooth one and we are taken on a wild ride with Peter and Ellie which gives us great scenes such as the doughnutdunking lesson Walls Of Jericho and the nowclassic hitchhiking scene. The humour is still fresh and fastpaced over 70 years later. Oops I almost forgot the classic 'no undershirt scene' where Gable sexily gives Colbert a lesson in how a man undresses to reveal shock horror! no undershirt but a bare chest! This had a bad effect on the sales of men's undershirts which dropped dramatically after the film's release One of the first examples of product placement in film. Great supporting characters particularly the scenestealing Oscar Shapeley Roscoe Karns. Of course it has it's faults all early talkies do. But any faults are outweighed by the great story.

	schema:headline " Romantic Comedy that sweeps the first year of the Oscars";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this movie a few times over the year and have just recently  viewed it again twice on the DVD version. This is a highly recommended  movie on several levels. First it has to be seen because it won  multiple academy awards during 1934. It has won at least best actor best actress and best director.  So it should be seen just for it's historical significance if you are  into movies as an art form. However if you are just looking for  entertainment then it is simply a great classic romantic comedy. The  set up is that Ellie Claudette Colbert is a rich spoiled  independent woman who is running away from her father in Florida to  join her husband not quite a complete marriage in New York City. She  meets Peter Clark Gable on the bus who is a down  out reporter  looking for a big story. They join forces in that he will help her to  get to New York for an exclusive on her story. In essence it is the  bratty socialite vs the hard nosed know it all reporter  Can they  achieve true love? Just watch the movie and figure it out for  yourself.. There is the classical scene regarding the battle of the  sexes which involves hitchhiking. There is some dated material because  the movie was made in the 30's about the 30's. This may be both good  and bad as a viewing experience. Gable is a bit too shallow as a  desirable character. He lacks the sensitivity of a guy that would be in  a modern romantic comedy. However his portrayal of Peter is likely  typical for the ideal man of the era in that he attempted to be  competent and in charge at all times the know it all guy. The  character comes across as too simplistic by today's standards. However  when he gets the feedback on his rough edges from Ellie he shows his  nice guy side. Claudette Colbert is great in this movie she had  opportunities to display her acting craft as she responded to different  situations. The scene in which she and Gable pretended to be basically  'white trash' was very funny. Her getting the best actress award is  very evident even without having to see the performances of her  rivalries for the Oscar in 1934. Overall this movie is rated a 9.0 and  is highly recommended. A viewer may avoid older movies because they  lack dept however hang in for this one. Once the screen chemistry  starts between Colbert and Gable their first scene together the rest  of the picture is just a joyride of entertainment in watching these two  work their magic for the camera. Enjoy this movie it should be an  awesome experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1934 Frank Capra's 'It Happened One Night' ushered in a new era of Hollywood filmmaking  the screwball comedy  and made Academy Award history in the process. It became the first film to be awarded the top five awards on the night Best Picture Director Actor Actress and Screenplay a feat that remained unequaled until 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest 1975' and 'The Silence of the Lambs 1991.' As I watch more of his films Frank Capra is fast becoming one of my most respected directors with such classics as 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' and 'It's a Wonderful Life' ranking among my favourites of all time. This screwball comedy however posed a certain problem since I've never been a huge fan of the subgenre. Whilst I had enjoyed such films as 'My Man Godfrey' and 'His Girl Friday' they hadn't really offered anything other than comedy. This means that they did a good job of making us laugh but never really inspired any other emotions  which isn't necessarily a handicap but doesn't appeal to my tastes.Happily I'm able to announce that 'It Happened One Night' did surpass my expectations and I found it to be a wonderfullyenjoyable very touching romantic comedy. The first half had left me feeling a bit uncertain since it reminded me of just about every other 1930s comedy I'd seen but then Frank Capra did what Frank Capra does best he put a lot of heart into the film. After building towards a perfect fairytale ending Capra suddenly snatches it away slowly but surely stacking the odds against our hero. However the director has never been one to leave us with a downbeat ending and when love finally prevails it feels twice as triumphant. Of course crucial to the film's success are the two lead performers Claudette Colbert and Clarke Gable playing characters of completely polar characters. As story runs its course we slowly watch their relationship transform from completely dislike to acceptance to romance and it never feels forced or artificial despite a reportedly tense atmosphere onset.The plot of the film was based on the story The Night Bus by Samuel Hopkins Adams. Ellie Andrews Colbert is the arrogant spoilt heiress of a wealthy father Walter Connolly. After she marries the rich but unprincipled King Westley Jameson Thomas against her father's will Ellie strikes off to New York to be with the man she loves and her desperate father launches a statewide attempt to retrieve her. It is on a night bus that Ellie strikes up a frictional relationship with fired journalist Peter Warne Gable whose only initial interest in the stranded girl is a good newspaper story. Probably one of the best road movies ever made 'It Happened One Night' also has a few twists in the usual formula which have guaranteed its enduring stature. For example Ellie's father is revealed not to be an evil overbearing demon but is in fact shown to be a very kind reasonable and loving man who is only trying to guarantee the best for his daughter by ensuring that she marries somebody with principles King Westley later gives up the girl without a fuss compensated by a tidy sum of money.Much to my surprise I'd never seen a film starring Clarke Gable before but he really was a revelation. Never taking any situation too seriously and delivering every line with confidence and a hint of amusement Gable is the laidback everyman that the audience can relate to a stark contrast to Colbert's conceited and ungrateful upperclass rich girl. My favourite scene took place after the night bus accidentally ran off the road with the shifty passenger Oscar Shapeley Roscoe Karns threatening to reveal Ellie's true identity. Fearing that his exclusive story could leak into other hands Peter Warne declares himself to be the gangster who kidnapped Ellie threatens to harm Shapeley's family and then chases him into the night. Interestingly I followed up my viewing of this film with a 1939 Lux Radio Theater broadcast of the story introduced by Cecille B. DeMille and once again starring Gable and Colbert. This recording can be found if you're lucky as a special feature on the 'It Happened One Night' DVD and it's well worth a listen.".

Probably one of the candidate nights is less unobvious than the rest so I guess the title isn't COMPLETELY mystifying.  But actually Capra gives us the feeling that everything is up in the air.  Everyone knows that the hero and heroine of romantic comedies are bound to get hitched in the end  in most cases it's simply a question of staying awake.  But Capra makes us feel the contingency of it all.  I for one was convinced that right up until the final moment it could have gone either way.  How did Capra manage this?  Was it because he was a complete innocent or was it because he was remarkably sophisticated?  I don't suppose it matters it's results that count.I'm glad to see very little mention among the comments about the sexism of it all.  The characters have life their words have life and if such art as this could only be produced by a sexist society it's almost worth creating a sexist society and then dismantling it in order to get the art.  In modern romances I get the feeling that the writers are wearily writing feisty' lines for the heroine in an attempt to fool feminists who by and large aren't so easily fooled.  Claudette Colbert isn't feisty.  When she DOES assert her independence she means it.And of course when Clark Gable asserts his dominance HE means it.  You don't get sincerity like this these days.Anyway the ideology of a film if there is one is always beside the point except inasmuch as the ideology is AESTHETICALLY attractive or unattractive. This is an attractive film.  Two real individuals a real story some misunderstanding but no tiresome or pointless misunderstanding constant wit  and as I expressed amazement at earlier constant suspense.  And if THAT isn't enough to get you to watch it note that it was released in 1934.  The Hayes code didn't come into effect until 1935.  Not a moment too late.".

The characters have life their words have life and if such art as this could only be produced by a sexist society it's almost worth creating a sexist society and then dismantling it in order to get the art.  In modern romances I get the feeling that the writers are wearily writing feisty' lines for the heroine in an attempt to fool feminists who by and large aren't so easily fooled.  Claudette Colbert isn't feisty.  When she DOES assert her independence she means it.And of course when Clark Gable asserts his dominance HE means it.  You don't get sincerity like this these days.Anyway the ideology of a film if there is one is always beside the point except inasmuch as the ideology is AESTHETICALLY attractive or unattractive. This is an attractive film.  Two real individuals a real story some misunderstanding but no tiresome or pointless misunderstanding constant wit  and as I expressed amazement at earlier constant suspense.  And if THAT isn't enough to get you to watch it note that it was released in 1934.  The Hayes code didn't come into effect until 1935.  Not a moment too late.";

	schema:reviewBody "In Miami the spoiled socialite Ellie Andrews Claudette Colbert is trapped in the yacht of her controller father the Wall Street banker Andrews Walter Connolly who has just annulled her secret marriage with the snobbish aviator King Westley Jameson Thomas. Out of the blue Ellie jumps overboard and swims to the shore. Andrews hires a detective agency to find her and offers a 10000 dollars reward for any information about his daughter. But Ellie pawns her watch buys some clothing and a bus ticket to New York to meet her lover. She seats side byside with the cynical reporter Peter Warne Clark Gable. However when a thief steals her purse with her money in a bus stop and Ellie does not report to the police Peter recognizes and blackmails Ellie asking her to travel together with him. He promises to protect her and in return he would write her adventure to meet King Westley. Along their journey Ellie falls in love for Peter but when he vanishes from the motel where they are lodged and contacts her father later she believes he was only interested in the reward. In the end love triumphs and the wall of Jericho falls. It Happened One Night is another delightful and charming romantic comedy of Frank Capra. The romance of a cynical reporter with a spoiled young woman is very funny despite being naive and dated with witty dialogs and the chemistry between Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable is marvelous. The cinematography in black and white is wonderful with magnificent use of lighting to highlight the lead couple. Last time I saw this classic was on 29 January 2003 and this is the third time that I watch this film now on DVD from Columbia Distributor and I highly recommend it as one of the best romantic comedies ever.

	schema:reviewBody "Capra's 'It Happened One Night' is a fascinatingly shot romantic comedy. It has the 30's feel but at the same time I am surprised that such skill was used in the making of this movie during the 1930s. The camerawork is brilliant as it brings out both the spatial feel and the crowdiness. the long shots are effective and I liked how the scenes change in a sideways 'flip' mode. There's always something about the driving scenes of old classics that amuse me. Clearly the background was shot separately and then projected on to a screen during the shooting of the film while in the foreground the actors are just seated in a car pretending to drive. While the background scene changes the viewer keeps tuned to the wonderful dialogue between the actors. Needless to add the film's got fantastic dialogue.Capra also brilliantly gives us a glimpse of the 30's American society especially focusing on gender and class status. The difference between the upper class rich people and the common ordinary man is shown by their use of language and their nonverbal behaviour. Yet in a way the film is also ahead of its time. Ellie isn't just some clichd damsel of the 30s. She is strongminded stubborn and smart albeit slightly naive. She is one who fights for what she wants rather than giving in easily. Perhaps this is also one quality of hers that attracts Peter but at the same time their funny quarrels also indicate that there is a an equality in gender status which was something women were struggling with in those days.The characters are very well etched. Peter and Ellie were a lot of fun but I also liked how Alexander Andrews played excellently by Walter Connolly was written as the rich father who's got all the money but all he wants for his daughter is her happiness. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are great together as they match wits and display warm chemistry.'It Happened One Night' has become an instant favourite one that I definitely plan to revisit.".

	schema:reviewBody "Consider this It Happened One Night was made in 1933 which gives it the distinction 70 years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences. And most of the runnerups for oldest film are 1930's screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the 1934 Academy Awards. The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant. The main reason It Happened One Night worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capra's direction. Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production. Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut. Cohn told Capra That French broad likes money and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of 50000 double her usual price and a guarantee that production would only last 28 days. Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B. Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this film.The film had a lot else going for it a motivated Capra a great script that would play well with small town America and a good ensemble of supporting talent. The story concerns a spoiled young heiress Colbert trying to escape the control of her father nicely played by Walter Connelly. Dodging her father's private detective she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter Gable who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story. Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other brainless brat and obnoxious bully as an undisclosed affection develops. On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each other.While the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film. As another reviewer has written Far from loveydovey the dialogue is witty sharp and occasionally heartless. We may know the outcome but the road to get there is paved with arguments anger and misunderstandings. It's also clever funny and a bit risqu for 1934 . During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult motivated by a desire to improve her companion's opinion of her. Gable shows real star presence playing a confident charming and resourceful gentleman. By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partner.After the Oscar ceremony Capra threw a party where he downed a magnum of champagne and passed out on his front lawn clutching his Best Director Oscar.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

This might have been an upset in 1934 considering other toprated films and performances of the year but who would have imagined IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT to still be as entertaining today as it was back in 1934?This now wellknown plot that's been remade twice by Columbia as EVE KNEW HER APPLES 1945 with Ann Miller and William Wright and YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT 1956 with June Allyson and Jack Lemmon opens in a yacht in Miami where Ellen Ellie Andrews Claudette Colbert spoiled daughter of a millionaire Wall Street banker Alexander Andrews Walter Connolly who disapproves of her recent marriage to aviator King Westley Jameson Thomas making arrangements on having it annulled. Following a heated argument with her father Ellie runs from her state room jumps overboard and swims to shore.

While on board Ellen encounters Peter Warne Clark Gable a hotheaded reporter recently fired by his editor Joe Gordon Charles C. Wilson.

Hours before reaching New York and taking a rest stop in an auto camp misunderstandings occur as Ellen awakens to find both Peter and the car gone.A simple story playing like an overlong B movie IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a memorable bus trip of so many classic scenes that have been imitated by others but never duplicated. Highlights include the Walls of Jericho where Peter and Ellen share a room in auto camps where a blanket is tossed over a rope that separates the couple as they sleep for the night Peter demonstrating to Ellen on how a man undresses particularly one in which he removes his shirt to no undershirt underneath Peter's correct method of dunking a doughnut into a cup of coffee and the classic hitchhiking scene where Peter fails to attract cars while Ellen comes up with a method all her own.Although IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is essentially a Claudette Colbert movie from start to finish there's no secondary female character quite rare for its time. Due to the strength of Gable's performance this has been hailed to be his best comedic role. Gable's character is hotheaded and forceful living by a moral code. Although he shares a cabin with a married woman that's all he does. He even tells Colbert's Ellie when she asks if she'll ever see him again he replies I make it a policy not to run around with married women. And when he's hungry he takes a carrot from a farm rather than going through the method of panhandling. This is Gable a role model. Director Frank Capra whose subject matter is usually on people captures the many extras especially those on the bus and auto camps to make them appear as important as leading players. Roscoe Karns is equally memorable believe you me! as the gabby bus passenger Oscar Shapeley from Orange New Jersey Ward Bond as the tough talking bus driver the meek Arthur Hoyt and the nosy domineering Blanche Frederici as the auto camp owners Georgie Breakston the poor boy traveling on the bus with his mother Claire McDowell along with other passengers gathered together and singing The Man on the Flying Trapeze to a player of a snoring fat and bald man who rests his head on Colbert's shoulder. During it's entire 106 minutes there's seldom any underscoring. As for the costumes with the exception of the final 15 minutes both Gable and Colbert use the same clothing through most of their trip.While Gable and Colbert had challenging roles in their careers plus their reunion in MGM's largescale BOOM TOWN 1940 it's amazing how this likable little comedy was the only one to honor them Academy Awards. There's a scene where I feel Gable earned his statuette the one where he tells Ellen the type of girl he would like to someday marry saying that those kind of women don't exist anymore. Gable says this with frankness and sincerity. Colbert on the other hand earned hers from that same scene as she she listens and looks on lovingly at Gable with tears flowing down her cheek coming to realize it happened one night.IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT not only became a perennial favorite on late night television during the 1960s and 70s but on cable TV as well ranging from the Disney Channel 1980s American Movie Classics prior to 2001 to Turner Classic Movies and availability on video cassette and finally DVD. While IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT has aged in appearance it's still timely screen entertainment. There'll never be another film like this again. 12".

I am a little confused about the laidback approach to marriage and annulment but this is a romance and that is not uncommon... if anything it shows how fickle the socialite is.Overall a very enjoyable film.

But It happened one night is one of those films that leaves you amazed without any reservations. I was neither a Clark Gable Claudette Colbert or a Frank Capra fan before I saw this road movie which won 5 Oscars but after I did I became of fan of them for life! The story here is so damn simple that you may at first think that everyone could be able to pull it of but when you think about it you will realize that at the same time it's actually very clever carefully written and touching. Take this scene for instance. Ellen is looking in front of herself while a burglar steals her luggage behind her back. She doesn't notice anything but Peter sees this and runs after the burglar. Ellen still not turning around is wondering where he is running of to. After a while Peter all tired returns and says He got away...! And Ellen not knowing what's going on replies I don't know what you are talking about! That's a perfect example how someone is trying to be a gentleman and ends up as a fool. But this is actually a film more touching than funny. After a while the spoiled Ellen shows her gentle side and realizes that she loves Peter. She says this to her father in tears because she thinks that Peter doesn't love her. So incredibly magical and yet so simple. It's incredibly high grade of 910 on the site rottentomatoes.com is justified. Too bad almost all TV stations are keeping this jewel of air for decades! No wonder my generation is trapped in a vicious circle of violence drugs and alcohol. They never got a glimpse of such previous generations with a soul and such raw honest and touching beauty like It happened one night which exceeds the human mind.Grade 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "It Happened One Night happens to be my personal most favorite film ever. It was an adapted screenplay by Robert Riskin from the short story Night Bus and was directed by Frank Capra. With a simple story plot modest budget and a very short four week production schedule this film goes a long way. Director Frank Capra obviously knew the story to tell and how to tell it. Some of the best films are made in a surprisingly short amount of time and on a modest budget. This film followed what Capra hoped would be a critical and box office success. The hopes were low for this film even after securing stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert for the lead roles. Columbia Studios was not well respected at the time in Hollywood.It Happened One Night 1934 had a relatively small budget for it's time 325000 of which Claudette Colbert asked for and received 50000 for her role. A star receiving this much of the total film budget was unheard of during the 1930's. Released during America's Great Economic Depression the film had excellent timing and proved to be a big critical and audience hit. All the right elements came together. It had a high quality comedic screenplay with believable characters in believable situations. A film where luck and chemistry came together producing a film that exceeded the expectations of everyone involved including its' director Frank Capra.The film comes across as light hearted and natural and with excellent timing and pacing. For it's time this style of film was new. It would be one of the first of a new genre screwball romantic comedy. Winner of five Academy Awards in all the major categories Best Picture Director Adapted Screenplay Actor in a Leading Role and Actress in a Leading Role was a first in Hollywood history. Only two other films have swept the five top Academy Awards One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest 1975 and The Silence of the Lambs 1991.Claudette Colbert was quoted as saying I just finished the worst film ever on It Happened One Night. She had no idea how well the film would be edited. The film editing here is subtle and sublime. Colbert and Gable achieved that rare and special screen chemistry in the film. Colbert's demand that the film needed to be produced in four weeks because of her vacation schedule actually created the lively pace of the film working in it's favor. It Happened One Night is a fine example of a quality screenplay some good luck and a lot of chemistry all coming together producing an enduring and enjoyable comedy classic.Clark Gable comes across as completely natural and very entertaining. The fun had while making this film shows partly in Gable's performance. Unfortunately he would not be cast in a comedic role again even after the big success of this film. The studio system of the time demanded stars remain typecasted. For Gable that meant macho romantic leading action man.To me It Happened One Night is the best ever romantic comedy film a gold standard for it's genre. It's lost none of it's charm and naturalness since it's release in 1934. The look of the film dates it but it still delivers it's original naturalness charm wittiness timing pacing and entertainment value. Just about a perfectly made film.".

After enduring to the bitter end the most flattering thing I can say is that the camera appeared to be in focus for the full duration of the film. I'm willing to make concessions given the cultural differences of the time periods but I can't imagine that peoples innate senses of humor and romance have changed THAT much. I mean really did folks back in the day think dissertations on dunking donuts and piggyback rides were funny? I realize the players in older films can be exaggerated and caricatures but the obnoxious male bus passenger was just too much. It was one of many cringeworthy scenes that left me wondering if the art of writing screen plays was in it's infancy. Incidentally who didn't think Peter's terrorist threats against the bus guy's family were a howler! I'm still laughing at that one?!?!As for chemistry between the two stars distilled water appears more reactive. Peter was a selfrighteous grouch who wanted some dream dame who likes to frolic on the beach and look at the stars. Who wouldn't want a guy like that? She... come to think of it I don't remember anything about her desires or ambitions. Her facial expressions and lack of anything resembling passion were confusing. There was nothing to like on either side. He wasn't an appealing character and she was boring.I will say the movie was funny as an audience participation event. When Peter ran and caught a car to retrieve his belongings from a filmflam man I couldn't help busting a gut. Either the cars were very slow in those days or the cigarettes they were smoking really did make them more fit. Either way there were several incredible circumstances in the movie that had me chuckling.I suppose the movie wasn't a complete waste of time but I'm still wondering what happened and on which night?".

Over 70 years later the magic still works due to the terrific combination of Gable Colbert and director Capra.But it almost didn't happen at all.Both Gable and Colbert tried desperately to get out of doing IHON. In fact it appeared noone in Hollywood wanted the parts of Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews. The tiny cashstrapped Columbia Studios was making this film with an untried comedy formula it looked a certain flop. Pfft. How wrong everyone was. IHON swept the Academy Awards taking home all of the Major Awards including Best Actor and Actress Awards for Gable and Colbert. It established the screwball comedy genre and the careers of it's two stars and director Capra.Why is it so good? Well it has remained so fresh over the years that the laughs beat out almost every modern romantic comedy. It doesn't have to rely on smut or toilet humour to satisfy the audience just a classic battle of the sexes we can all relate to. It's witty the dialogue is snappy and fastpaced and the acting is near perfect. So let's have a closer look at the plot of this gem Spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews Colbert has just defied her father by marrying society aviator King Westley. Her angry father wishes to keep Ellie away from her unsuitable husband and whisks her away on his private yacht. Daddy hasn't counted on Ellie's tenacity and will fed up with the fact her childish hungerstrike is going nowhere she literally jumps overboard. When back on dry land she tries to make her way back to her husband by bus trip. A series of unfortunate events bring out of work newspaper reporter Peter Warne into her life. Cue the battle of the sexes! She has no money so she must accept his help he knows who she is and to land the biggest scoop of his career he must deceive her whilst also helping her get back to Westley. But problems arise when the pair inevitably start to fall in love.This film is just the tonic that Depression audiences would have soaked up. The parodying of the rich is sublime you can't help rooting for Gable who is a fine representative of the underdog. It also has it's risqu elements that I'm surprised got past the Hayes Code that had just been enforced. In particular Gable's sexy lesson to a shocked yet interested Colbert on how a man undresses and the final 'breaking down the walls of Jericho' scene. When Gable undressed to reveal a bare chest with NO undershirt sales dropped off dramatically. This would be one of the earliest examples of product placement in film.Some of my favourite scenes the donutdunking lesson the piggyback ride Gable and Colbert's mock fight and the justifiably classic Hitchhiking scene. Colbert beats the cocky Gable at his own game by proving that SHE doesn't have to use her thumb to pull a ride. Instead she shows a bit of leg and stops a vehicle much to the horror of Gable. Great stuff!This film almost singlehandedly established the great screwball comedy. Colbert's Ellie is the ultimate screwy damepaving the way for Lombard and Hepburn in the genre with Gable's Peter a direct forerunner to the Fredrich March character in the screwball classic 'Nothing Sacred' 1937. This films holds a very important place in motion picture history.Best of all it's so enjoyable.1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first movie to sweep all the major Academy Awards this film is still popular today. That's probably so because the dialog between the two stars of the picture  Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert  is just great. Those two make this fun to watch. I enjoyed it however much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones. It lost some of its zip after I knew what to expect. The ending too was very weak. Over the last 20 minutes the two stars go their separate ways until the very end and the story gets very stupid.The nice romance that had developed between the two seemed to have disintegrated when Gable left one early morning for good intentions but didn't tell Colbert. The latter thought Gable ran out on her. Hollywood in films of the 1930s and 1940s loved to have romances in which confusion abounded and everything was misinterpreted for the worst....until the happy ending when the truth somehow would surface. That same theme was in here along with yet another trivialization of marriage another common theme during the classic era. Colbert says it herself in one line mentioning she doesn't care for this other guy but what the heck might as well get married what's the difference? Huh?If the scriptwriters here would have just kept the road part of this film going longer  with Gable and Colbert trading barbs  it would have been super. Gable has the best lines an is the most fun to watch but Colbert can hold her own. She looks really pixieish and cute although most of her closeups are done with a fuzzy lens another habit of filmmakers of that era had with female stars. One of the film world's most famous scenes is in this movie the hitchhiking scene in which the cocky Cable explains the different ways of successful thumbing in order to get a ride....and gets nowhere while Colbert on her first try gets a car to stop immediately after she lifts up her skirt! That is still one of the great comedic scenes in movie history.Overall this is still one of the best comedies of The Golden Age even with its faults.".

In exchange he wants an exclusive on her story. The two tag along together getting through some interesting adventures. Over time they even get to like each other...A gem of a film from legendary director Frank Capra. I was expecting a rather standard romantic drama but It Happened One Night is so much better than that. Warm and hilariously funny at times it's certainly not your average romantic comedy. Dialogue is incredibly fresh and snappy and even the romantic side is not straightforward keeping the schmaltz to a minimum and taking some unpredictable twists and turns.The great direction by Capra and the solid script are aided by wonderful performances from Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert in the lead roles. The chemistry between them is great and their delivery is spoton.Both Gable and Colbert received Oscars for their performances as did Capra for Best Director. The movie was the welldeserved 1935 Best Picture Oscar winner.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sorry to say but this movie is just a bit too overrated. Especially Capra's directing is disappointing since it's done in such an extremely old fashioned manner for 1934 standards. Surprisingly enough he still won an Oscar for his directing of this movie though.It's definitely an entertaining enough movie to watch. These type of movies were the romantic comedies of the '30's the sort of Cameron Diaz and Asthon Kutcher flicks of their time only done with more class and better actors involved. Nevertheless it's just as clichd and predictable though. Dozens of these type of movies got made in the '30's and quite frankly I just can't see what it is that makes this movie a better one than any of them.It's a boy meets girl story and of course they can't get along at first but slowly begin to like each other better and more. What makes this movie its story more special is its adventurous elements being thrown in. It's a movie that involves lots of traveling and therefor also many different characters which mainly gives the movie its adventurous feeling without ever really getting a big adventure.More fireworks was to be expected especially from Frank Capra's directing. It's just too formulaic and at times even just plain poor. It's way too old fashioned for 1934 and it's one of those typical movies that features long closeups for the dramatic moments. It's a very static made film as if it was just a job that had to be done and no real passion was thrown into it.As could be expected the acting is still great though from Clark Gable and the much more unknown Claudette Colbert. They were good together and luckily shared some good chemistry which made the movie all the more fun to watch. This was actually the movie that earned Clark Gable his only Oscar out of his career. Ironicly enough non of the actors really enjoyed starring in this movie and also lots of well known actor turned the script down and Claudette Colbert who also received an Oscar for her role in this movie even didn't took the trouble to attend the award ceremony at first until hearing upon her win.Yes I know I'm making the movie sound horrible which it really isn't. It's basically a movie I enjoyed watching but is no way worthy of this currently high rating on here. There are way better genre movies and Capra movies with a much lower rating on here though. There are better and more interesting Capra movies to watch out there which does not mean that this movie is an horrible one though.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Overlooked Pagnol Film";
	schema:reviewBody "This 1948 Pagnol film is an effective if somewhat slight tale of unrequited love. It is known mainly to film historians for being one of the first French films made in colour. Nonetheless it stands on its own as a minor work of art.Based on a completely fictional incident from Franz Schubert's life the film like all of Pagnol's work has more of a French Provencial feel than an Austrian one.Most interesting is the casting of Tino Rossi as Schubert. This brave decision actually works well with the balladeer giving a nuanced performance as the great composer.Also effective is the casting of Jacqueline Pagnol as the titular miller's daughter. She plays the shallow girl to great effect. Selfish and superficial she dismisses Schubert's love and thereby misses out on her chance at longterm happiness and her place in history. Instead she is only looking for shortterm gratification no matter what hurt this will cause those around her. In the brilliant dialogue towards the film's end Schubert notes that she only saw her own reflection in the water and did not see the world around her.The river motif is used effectively in this and other parts of the film. The obvious allusions are to Schubert's Trout Quintet of course but the many references give the film a structure and depth it would otherwise have lacked. Particularly effective is the dialogue about the suicides of the rejected suitors at the film's end.The film's ending is somewhat subversive and would no doubt grate with many modern feminists. The girl chooses to become the plaything of the aristocrat seeing it as a way of material advancement. She rejects love to willingly submit as a toy who will no doubt eventually be discarded. Her character is not redeemed  for such a selfish and superficial girl there is little to no hope of redemption.Rossi's music is used effectively and each time he sings one sees the character of Schubert grow. The music develops as he gains each new insight from living at the mill.In a sense this film is romantic just as Schubert's compositions were as it presents the notion that the artist must encounter the sublimities of nature the earthiness of rustic peasantry and the hardships of life for his soul and spirit to grow. Ironically though it is the miller's daughter who has grown up in this world all of her life is the one who fails to mature. Unfortunately the film does have a few weaknesses. Colour appears to have been used as a gimmick only largely in order to compete with the Hollywood films flooding the postWar French market. It is not used to any great artistic effect apart from displaying the captivating scenery to good effect.The aristocrat who wins the miller's daughter away is a onedimensional character conforming to every stereotype of the debauched nobility.In conclusion this film is fairly slight but contains hidden depths for those prepared to look for them. Seek it out and you may be pleasantly surprised.".

With the use of a bulky projector with four black n white strips of film with one of the films having the sound track how could that been cheaper than Technicolor? Agfa color was available for France Why didn't he used that? That would of been more cheaper. The print is grainy. There are fringe problems on some of the shots. The color is duller than Eastman color.This wasn't France's first talking feature in color. The first one was in 1946 in AGFA color.Some other color processes for motion picture films in France where experimented with. Like Franchita Colour but that wasn't a hit it was used only for film advertisement.This movie isn't for popular classic film fans cause to their eye's this be no good. I doubt this would even be broad casted in United States. The classic movie channels are too greedy.This is Marcel Pagnoles only fluff as popular classic film fans would sayfilm. It's France's Heart throb of the 30 and 40's and even after the war when his work prohibition ended he had collaborated with the Nazis in world war 2. Tino Rossi.His first and maybe only appearance in color maybe. In the Ernest Marishka version of Franz Shubert on in 1958the girl dumps him for his friend Franz Shobert. In this 1948 version What a coincidenthe has over come his first love.

When he trails he notices a naked blond girls swimming He asks a little girl who that is. The little girl tells him thats the miller's daughter  played by Marcels Pagnole's second wife Jaqualine Pagnole. He decides to go back and work for the miller because he'es interested in her. The focus in this film is the relationship he has with the miller and then the daughter.He's inspires to write a song for her.

This leads the Comte to invite the daughter and her father and Franz to a party where he's asks to conduct the orchestra.

On the box cover and the back and the photos on the DVD they show Jaqualinein another dress and a up do at the party. But the film version she's wearing braids. This might of been a costume and hair do test shot before Pagnole made his decision. This is for fans of classic films who like obscure classics with the great ones .

Most of his ride is spent gazing out the windows at the misty countryside telling us more about this lonely lost vulnerable young eighteen year boy than a thousand words.

When Simon arrives home he is met by his loving mother Marie Nicole Garcia his sister Alice Alysson Paradis and his father. Louise joins Simon as a guest in his home and his family thinks the two are a couple.

Simon visits Mathieu with Louise not far behind and though we feel a kinship between the two boys Louise forces her attention on Mathieu and Simon becomes a third party.

Simon becomes isolated longs for Mathieu who has moved on from their past relationship an emotional level which is culminated in a visit to Mathieu's home where Simon alone on Mathieu's bed revisits the passion and lust and love for Mathieu in a scene of radiant beauty.Simon's parents argue at all times and this leads to the discovery of a previous affair his mother had an affair which holds secrets that drive a stake into Simon's relationship to Louise and to his mother's lover who as he visits the mother uncovers significant mysteries. The story ends tragically in a coda suggestive of the beginning of the film. It is stunning.For some the sparse dialogue may prevent the storyline from driving clearly but in the hands eyes and body of Gabriel Ulliel words are wholly unnecessary. If there were no other reason to see this very sensitive film having the opportunity to observe the talented Ulliel would be sufficient. Recommended viewing in French with English subtitles.

Something of their earlier most likely sexual relationship is alluded to during Simon's visit to a local lighthouse and his conversation with Mathieu who is its keeper. While he might have been hoping for some sort of rekindling it soon becomes apparent to Simon and to us that M. is moving on as concerns his relationship preferences yes he likely enjoys the wild kiss he initiates with S.at Louise's urgingbut not enough to change his current course. Louise is now his focus something that becomes 'majorly' upsetting to S.If you require further proof of Simon's true feelings you need only view the lateinthefilm scene in which S. enters Mathieu's quarters when M. is away makes his way to the bed lies in it eyes closed holding the bedclothes then the pillow to his nose and deeply breathes in Mathieu's scent. While doing this he is moved to initiate his own selfgratification. A tremendously sexy sceneI kept hoping Mathieu would appear in the doorway but obviously other things were afoot.Mother Marie's startling disclosure near film's conclusion concerning one of the major relationships in Simon's life results in an ending you are unlikely to soon forget.PSMuch of this script is a little slow moving and sometimes repetitive. My 6 awarded Stars are aimed primarily at Ulliel's acting as Simon but also at Garcia's as mother. I won't be throwing this out of my DVD collection but likely will not be viewing it often.SOME LATERINTIME THOUGHTS A POSTMORTEM IF YOU WILLMay 2007Following young late teens Simon as the film begins and later meeting those who make up the short arc of his life we begin our study of a most fragile existence. Almost immediately we're given Louise. Learning about this young past midteens girl who appears at story's beginningand sticks with Simon almost throughoutbecomes strangely intriguing. Who indeed is Louise? His fiancetobe......is she really? Or is she something else?Next there's the question of his family Simon has an unhappy relationship with his father one of misunderstandings. The connection with his 2year older sister is a contentious one. That then leaves his loving and protective mother......a mother who comes across as being ultimately perceptive of a very fragile son. This strangely is the same mother who at film's end gives him absolutely catastrophic news......and then ending the family's vacation departs their seaside home leaving Simon completely alone. At that point we have been given in a most jolting manner by the film's writerdirector something her type mother would never never ever do.Ah.........but Mother is not to worry for as this tale draws to an end a shockingly devastating scene is being caught for us and for her by video camera nut Simonpreserving on film as he so likes to do life's important events.If any film on DVD cries out for a Director's Commentary it is this one. As just one reason there are numerous action jumps  changes wherein the preceding scene activity has apparently? nothing to do with that which follows. Some are only one shot long such as a nighttime scene of a man entering a neardistant home of two lit rooms then moving from one room to the other turning out lights as he goesleaving us with only a twinkling indoor Christmas tree as the shot fades.

	schema:reviewBody "The previous reviews make interesting points about this film most of them plausible and some very perceptive. The following is more an analysis than a review and contains SPOILERS. If you have not viewed the movie and intend to do so you might want to watch it before reading further. The film is a study in ambiguity  taking that Frenchfilm hallmark to a new level  and I do not pretend to have the definitive interpretation of the characters' emotions and actions. But here are my somewhat disjointed and not entirely original thoughts.Louise and Simon are both stalkers of the active and passive types respectively. Sort of yin and yang initially secret siblings. Simon is an observer introverted but not entirely introspective always looking out at others through a glass a window or a camera lens. Does the glass distort or clarify his vision? In either case it separates him from the others  he is emotionally isolated from everyone. In the end he stops watching and acts shattering the glass to end the isolation in the only way he can. Simon does not meet Louise by chance on the train  she pursues him playing on his loneliness so as to insinuate herself into the family circle at Christmas yet. Her motivations remain unclear to me. Apparently she initially wanted to learn more about her halfbrother but her actions seem quite malevolent when she pursues Mathieu even though it is clear that this increases Simon's distress. So I take a darker view of the affection she shows Simon she seems to be setting him up for his ultimate devastation.While the film gives no incontrovertible proof that Simon has a romanticsexual interest in Mathieu many scenes indicate strongly to me that that is the case. Soon after Simon arrives in La Rochelle he leaves Louise in the car to climb to the top of the lighthouse to seek Mathieu out and he is obviously disturbed when Louise follows. When the three are together Simon is continually looking past or around Louise to gaze at Mathieu and when Louise leaves the bed to make hot chocolate Simon lies staring at the sleeping Mathieu. Several times Simon alludes to and tries to rekindle their past relationship but Mathieu has moved beyond it if Simon did not misinterpret it from the beginning. When Simon gratifies himself on Mathieu's bed where Mathieu and Louise have apparently just made love intoxicated by the scent of the bedding he could be assuming the place of either of the two but the other indications make me think he is supplanting Louise. Finally the obvious phallic image of the lighthouse bears some consideration and I think it bolsters the sexual element of Simon's interest in Mathieu. Whenif I watch the film for a second time I would pay more attention to Simon's art. It seems that Mathieu has not figured it out  and is probably incapable of doing so. When he mentions the article he saw about Simon's photographs Mathieu says it was poorly edited and the pictures sloppily presented unfocused and cropping off parts of the subject. He does not understand what Simon is doing in the photos or in life. When Marie steals a look at Simon's portfolio she begins to understand the full sense of desolation within Simon. Most of the pictures feature the dunes and coast in the vicinity of the lighthouse. At other points in the film Simon appears at most of these same places. The pictures are portraits of Mathieu  without Mathieu. I have not figured out the significance of the first three pictures of the statuette but assume they relate to Marie herself. I would welcome ideas about those. Then there are Simon's film clips  mostly blurred confusing fragments depicting the actions and emotions of those around him  things he is capable of recording but not it seems comprehending or accepting.In addition to the homosexual implications of the film there are strong elements of incest in the relationships between Louise and Simon and Simon and his mother. Simon's final posthumous commentary speaks to that. Freud would have had fun with those relationships and the images of the father  one false one absent. Was Simon pushed over the edge by the realization that he has been kicked out of Mathieu's bed by his sister and out of his mother's bed by his true father? Now for my review I give Gaston Ulliel a 10 and the rest of the film a 4 for an average of 7. The film did make me think. I tend to overanalyze things  looking for and finding images symbols motives and meanings that may be utter figments of my imagination entirely unintended by the filmmakers. Often that analysis is a somewhat fruitless endeavor but in this case I think it is exactly what the filmmakers did intend. They provided hints clues seemingly random moments often blurred and fragmentary like Simon's movies for us to try to comprehend and piece together into a meaningful narrative. Was it worthwhile for me? Under most circumstances I would not have watched the film to the end. Parts of it really dragged  Simon's endless splashing at night in the swimming pool the long drives at night on country roads the stuffed seabird always lurking like the Raven. And despite Gaspard Ulliel's extraordinary magnetism and acting skill the almost unremitting and in my estimation unexplained gloom that pervades his character became tedious to the point where the inevitable ending came as a relief not a shock. I did watch till the end and might watch it again  if only for the glimpses of Ulliel some of them transcendently beautiful. But if you are not fascinated by Ulliel many other films are just as thoughtprovoking and ultimately more rewarding for anyone who is not into angst for angst's sake.".

He has shone in such films as Tchin's gars Strayed and the upcoming Hannibal Rising that exploit his wild look his animalistic air of danger. He is frequently seen as frightening and independent. He is sweet as the boyfriend in A Very Long Engagement though. The Last Day shows him off better as an actor because here he is almost always on screen but is allowed to be hesitant mysterious  the essence of a film that holds back its meanings and makes us guess what's going on. Simon is delicate thoughtful and kind a manchild and a slightly maladroit creature who detaches by filming and photographing the world. In playing Simon Ulliel reveals admirable restraint. He shows how an actor must use he physical equipment. His looks are striking but what counts is that he can do such different things with them.Simon Ulliel is a young arts student. On the night train to his family's Christmas party he picks up a girl who comes along and then quickly takes up with someone who seems to be Simon's former flame. Simon sleeps with along side her but can't have her. And he's been left out of the know because despite being all of 18 he still isn't aware of something important about himself. Rodolphe Marconi's film is nicely understated never dwelling on a scene too long stingy with dialogue and scornful of flashy effects. Ulliel's delicacy is essential to these qualities. So is something inaccessible about him that helps keep his somewhat pathetic situation from ever seeming sentimental. Mlanie Laurent as the girl and Christophe Malavoy as the head of the household help round out an impeccable cast.The Last Day is full of a dry French tact and escapes being dreary if only just by the characters' composure and fortitude. Simon is an athlete swimming tennis but also a good sport in everythingand despite his breathtaking ease in the pool he has a jerky little walk. What good manners he has! He is always there in deep closeups bashful and quiet. Yet we feel his hurt all the more deeply because it isn't acted out. Bruno Todeschini simmers. Nicole Garcia is like a more ravaged Rampling. There's nothing not to like except the ditsy pop songs with English lyrics. Fortunately at a crucial late scene an elegant John Lewis piano solo takes over.".

As the mysterious Mathieu Thibault Vinon Simon's unrequited love reappears Louise and Mathieu develop a liaison of their own and we contemplate Simon's morbid sadness as dark secrets are uncovered.The Last Day is a very personal slowpaced sensual and tragic story. It's very French in its aesthetics which I love and mood and Marconi owes great part of his film's power to the amazing talent of Ulliel who says more with a single look than most of today's young actors with a thousand words. In spite of his first bad move in Hollywood with Hannibal Rising I believe Ulliel is destined to become an international star and if he doesn't that's also fine as long as he keeps picking daring roles in great films in his homeland. The soundtrack is also eclectic and memorable and Marconi even reserves the improvised sudden musical scene that's a trademark of some contemporary French directors like Franois Ozon and Christophe Honor. It could seem out of place and even ridiculous but works beautifully here. Not a film for everybody and ultimately depressing but a memorable poignant experience nonetheless. 910.".

This movie is alike to many of other French movies that I saw before which contains little or minimal dialogue. It conveys the message through showing symbolic scenes.However what troubles me the most is not such 'absence of dialogue' but rather the clarity and sense of direction in the film. The love that grow between Simon and Matthew is only evident somehow in the middle of the film but for the rest  it is clearly unclear of what Simon thinks or at least other characters should have played greater role to clarify the role of the main character. As a result of this unclarity  all scenes appear to be just randomly and awkwardly put in.The movie is incredibly slow. There is no significant or notable progression that the audience should be rewarded after watching the film for around 2 hours.Aside from the talented and good looking actor Gaspard Ulliel who played Simon there is no other aspects of either in the story or plot that makes me eager to recommend this film to the general audiences.5 out of 10".

Then when you meet the 'Adam's Family' back home it's clear he's not one of them the Adam's Family that is! Then we find out that Simon has the hots for Mathieu who turns out to be a young version of Marc  his mother's toyboy.So  SM are going to get it together oui? Non  parce que LOUISE and Mathieu effectively get married at the Family's Christmas do. Louise is in her wedding dress. The 'Young married couple to be' NOT specifically SL are toasted and ML have their postwedding dance together with a salutary 'guard of honour' supplied by the local 'matelots'.So that's both SM AND SL killed with one stone.... and talking of birds the seagulls telegraphed the state of SM's relationship at the outset.At the Lighthouse a monster boner BTW  signifying what a studmuffin M is! Mathieu's seagull was dead never to be seen and 'yuk' rotten and outside on the balcony.Simon's seagull was also dead but preserved in S's bedroom wings outstretched head turned as if in grief in the exact same pose as the bw photo of a Michaelangelo bust in S's photo portfolio.So S was preserving his feelings for M whereas M's feelings for S were dead defenestrated and left to rot.... and it took LOUISE to literally tell us this fact. Appreciative applause  a master stroke! The wheeling seagulls permeated the seaside environs symbolising the very whirlwind which is life and love of course... So apart from being French why else is Simon gay? Very possibly because he didn't have a father. He had a cold relationship with his mother's husband and so spent his life 'looking for Dad' which is how SOME interpret homosexuality.No surprise then that Mathieu is the spit of Marc  his real Dad. No surprise either that the erotic bed scene of S on M's bed is echoed at the end with S on his Dad's bed  the other M.Incidentally we know well in advance that Marc is Simon's Dad because Marie spells it out in discussion with Louise about her real relationship with S. 'Like sister and brother?' All good stuff. You know what the outcome's going to be way in advance but unlike Star Wars it's a very entertaining and enjoyable ride getting there all the same.".

The original film starred Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Caine has the Olivier role in this version and he's paired with Jude Law. Here the film is directed by Kenneth Branaugh.The acting is spectacular. Both Caine and Law are gangbusters in their respective roles. I really like the chemistry and the clashing of personalities. It's wonderful and enough of a reason to watch when the script's direction goes haywire.Harold Pinter's dialog is crisp and sharp and often very witty and I understand why he was chosen to rewrite the play which is updated to make use of surveillance cameras and the like.The problem is that how the script moves the characters around is awful. Michale Caine walks Law through his odd modern house with sliding doors and panels for no really good reason. Conversations happen repeatedly in different locations. I know Pinter has done that in his plays but in this case it becomes tedious. Why do we need to have the pair go over and over and over the fact that Law is sleeping with Caine's wife? It would be okay if at some point Law said enough we've done this but he doesn't he acts as if each time is the first time. The script also doesn't move Caine through his manipulation of Law all that well. To begin with he's blindly angry to start so he has no chance to turn around and scare us.Never mind a late in the game revelation that makes you wonder why he bothered In the original we never suspected what was up. here we do and while it gives an edge it also somehow feels false since its so clear we are forced to wonder why Law's Milo doesn't see he's being set up. There are a few other instances but to say more would give away too much.Thinking about the film in retrospect I think its a film of missed opportunities and missteps. The opportunities squandered are the chance to have better fireworks between Caine and Law. Missteps in that the choice of a garish setting and odd shifts in plot take away from the creation of a tension and a believable thriller. Instead we get some smart dialog and great performances in a film that doesn't let them be real.despite some great performances and witty dialog this is only a 4 out of 10 because the rest of the script just doesn't work".

Thus the language was almost baroque and eyecatching gadgets mainly toys were everywhere to be seen. This approach drew bravura performances from both Michael Caine and Lawrence Olivier and the original Sleuth remains a masterclass in acting and how the audience can be engrossed by what is a filmed stage play.Not so the remake.Kenneth Brannagh the director and Harold Pinter the writer have obviously reacted against that by taking an entirely different approach which can only be described as minimalist. The setting the musical score which consists of the same short piece of music being played over and over and the dialogue are sparse. This appears to make it more difficult for the actors to play off each other and it shows.Of course there is always a great difficulty in translating a stage play to cinema and Sleuth has the added disadvantage of being a twohander. The 1972 version frankly admitted its origins and went with it while this recent remake looks and feels more like a madeforTV film than anything cinematic. The wandering camera tries to compensate for this lack of interest with all sorts of gimmicky angles. This is initially interesting but soon palls. Michael Caine while putting in his usual solid performance falls short of his commanding role in the first film while Jude Law is a little lightweight at least when he plays himself. He is actually more convincing in makeup and I found this part the second third of the film by far the most interesting in the film. However the manner in which this is directed with Law's back to the camera most of the time and obscure camera angles actually gives the game away much more than the straightforward approach in the 1972 film.Pinter's script is written in his characteristic style short sentences pointless questions being answered with other questions and the occasional gratuitous obscenity to spice things up. This has excited a whole generation of theatregoers to my bafflement since he is such a onetrick pony. Part of this strange heroworship of him is that he appears in the film on the TV delivering the same line as in the film. I guess this shows how selfreferential theatre folks are.By and large Pinter's script follows the plot of the original Sleuth. When he deviates from it it is always to the detriment of the latter film. The worst example of this is the insipid rewriting of the ending. The original finale with Olivier frantically looking for the objects that Caine has hidden is gone completely. This provided an exciting conclusion. Instead we have a lacklustre and bizarre homosexuality idea that is not just poor in itself but it actually undermines the marital infidelity premise for the first two thirds. Again I think this curiosity is a theatrical mindset which believes any two men in close proximity must be homoerotic.Not particularly worth watching except for fans of the original who wish to see how the same play has been reworked. For everyone else watch the 1972 version.Actually its worse than that Anyone who innocently watches this travesty BEFORE the 1972 version will have the experience of that ruined forever.".

	schema:headline " Sleuth According to Harold Pinter";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those cases in which it is impossible to talk about the film in question without making references to the original. The original was a pleasant enough and entertaining enough recreation of the Anthony Shaffer Broadway success. Then Joseph L Manckiewicz with the able complicity of Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine went for the gadgetry and deception that made the play a world wide success without adding or detracting much from the original. Now Jude Law producer as well as star approached Nobel laureate Harold Pinter to reinvent the whole thing and reinvented he did. Michael Caine takes now the Laurence Olivier part and Jude Law falls into the Michael Caine part perfectly. The elements are now cruder the language the set the wardrobe. Thankfully it's also shorter much much shorter. What's missing is the innocence. This time things are taken a bit too seriously. The homosexual element is a novelty but I must say not a surprise.

The original was a pleasant enough and entertaining enough recreation of the Anthony Shaffer Broadway success. Then Joseph L Manckiewicz with the able complicity of Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine went for the gadgetry and deception that made the play a world wide success without adding or detracting much from the original. Now Jude Law producer as well as star approached Nobel laureate Harold Pinter to reinvent the whole thing and reinvented he did. Michael Caine takes now the Laurence Olivier part and Jude Law falls into the Michael Caine part perfectly. The elements are now cruder the language the set the wardrobe. Thankfully it's also shorter much much shorter. What's missing is the innocence. This time things are taken a bit too seriously. The homosexual element is a novelty but I must say not a surprise. Jude Law exudes sex. It's impossible to put him in a confined environment with just one other person and not be sensitive to the sexual possibilities. He provokes without half trying.

The new house is a cold technological monstrosity instead of the country manor of Laurence Olivier. In Harold Pinter's hand and brain everything is colder darker and Shaffer's original comedy risks to become Ira Levin's Deathtrap at times. Michael Caine and Jude Law are inches away from a kiss here and that's a bizarre turn of events. True Jude Law has a sexual presence that he carries as if he didn't know was there. Everything he says has a sexual connotation whether consciously or unconsciously. His Milo Tindle looks decidedly post coital. A bit undone unwashed. Kenneth Brannagh conducts his duet with gusto but limited not just by the natural setting of the play but by the memory of the Manckiewicz original. Caine and Law make a fun dirty pair and it's the power of their performances that makes this very short version appear even shorter. I could have stay a few more minutes with this two.

	schema:reviewBody "Watched at the Toronto International Film FestivalI must declare my bias at the very outset as one who has seen the indelible 1972 original 3 times and consider it nothing short of absolutely brilliant. This remake in my bias view Harold Pinter script notwithstanding is a disappointment. In some cases trimming the original to a leaner and tightly packed version works. For Sleuth however trimming it from 138 minutes to 86 minutes is tantamount to cutting out the very essence that makes the movie click. I'll come back to this.If you have not seen the original you probably should not read on. In the first place there are SPOILERS aplenty. But even if you've seen the remake there is probably not much point because this is exclusively a comparison with the original and assumes that you've seen it.One look from the start and you know that people are trying to update this alltime classic. The electronic gadgets and ultramodern set design would almost make you believe that you are watching a Scifi. I don't find it objectionable. After all it's just style. The substances seems to be there at least initially as we see Act 1 unfold lean and compact with Caine now playing Olivier's role of superrich mystery writer Andrew Wyke. The character is somewhat updated also as Caine skillfully plays out the explosive emotion of a cuckolded husband. Explosive emotion however does not always equate with fine drama. Personally I would prefer Olivier's stiffupperlip portrayal where a sarcastic icy sneer digs deeper into another level of his detestation.Jude Law is a bit of a pleasant surprise in Act 2 in his performance as Scotland Yard Inspector Doppler. Playing Caine's original role of wifestealer Milo Tindle he is adequate. This is in fact the second time he play's Caine's role in a remake the first being Alfie. But as Tindle's alter ego coming for revenge he shines. Physically he is in fact a little more recognizable than Caine but his superb acting does the trick.But things start to fall apart after he has revealed his identity. What has been missing becomes more and more noticeable eventually becoming a gaping hole  the remake lacks a soul. The essence of the movie is in the two people playing games. The original takes the time and details necessary to develop this key element right from the beginning when Wake calls to Tindle who nonchalantly handles a game piece on his complicated board game Put it back it has taken me very a long time to get it to where it is something like that. Every detail points to Wake's seriousness about playing this game  from the hideous laughing of the mechanical figure of a sailor to dressing Tindle up as a clown. In the remake we hear Wyke TALKING a lot about his passion for playing games but it is far from being convincing.The worst is yet to come. The best part of the movie in the original is discarded completely. In the original after Tindle reveals his identity and claims that he has only scored threelove after Wake's sixlove first set the beauty is in how he evens the score. In the original he accomplishes this by a convoluted plot culminating in making Wyke run around his own house madly to solve three riddles that will allow him to remove incriminating evidence before the police arrive. This is gameplaying at the very best. In the remake there is  NOTHING. In its place is a totally contrived sequence suggesting homosexual possibilities which is neither clever nor amusing. Homosexuality is a good subject matter for a lot of movies see my comments on Brokeback mountain httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0388795usercomments1631 but to tag it on here to replace a brilliant ending amputated from the original is sheer incompetence.Granting a few exceptions remakes usually don't measure up to the original. Sleuth unfortunately is not one of the exceptions. Before you know it's point game set and match.".

Any comparison will not be favourable to this version.There is an obvious attempt to give this film an ultra modern feel by employing huge amounts of hightech gadgets and having sleek metal and chrome surfaces on display throughout the house. Kenneth Branagh has made use of various techniques such as showing the action through security cameras and filming from different angles to give this film a unique look. However none of these things are a problem. There is a slightly excessive use of swear words which does give the impression that the writer was trying desperately to engage a younger audience through any means necessary.The first half of this film is engaging enough and follows the plot of the original pretty closely. However the second half is a bit of a mess. Jude Law's performance is laughable and there is a homosexual undercurrent that has no place in the plot and is in fact very damaging to the credibility of the film. The ending is abrupt and totally devoid of tension.This film is worth a look but don't expect too much. Michael Caine takes on the role of the rich and bitter Andrew Wyke and plays it very well with no attempt to copy Olivier in any way. Jude Law is adequate but not outstanding. This film might be better suited to people who have not seen the original but in its own right this film is still not a classic of our time.".

That's a good thing you see as this slick and stylish oneonone thriller kept me and my friend on the edge of our seats throughout its whole 86 minutes running time. Now this may seem short for a film like this but trust me  it's a satisfying feature that'll leave you highly entertained once the credits start to roll.Based on a play Sleuth confronts two extremely clever British men in a game of trickery and deceit. Our characters are Andrew Wyke the one and only Michael Cain an aging famous author who lives alone in a hightech mansion after his wife Maggie has left him for a younger man and Milo Tindle the younger man an aspiring actor equipped with charm and witportrayed by the always charmantic Jude Law who demonstrates both qualities once again. When Wyke invite Tindle to his mansion Tindle seeks to convince the former into letting his wife go by signing the divorce paper. However Wyke seems far more interested in playing mind games with his wife's new lover and lures him into a series of actions he thoroughly planned in seeking revenge on his unfaithful spouse.Much can't be said about what happens from here on out without spoiling the movie but I'll try the best to bring the jest of what I felt towards the end result whilst speaking in general terms.As a play would unfold Sleuth is built of three prominent acts each raising the stakes our protagonists are willing to take as part of this oneonone confrontation. However while I found the first two extremely sarcastic intriguing and dare I say mean but not in a cruel manner the final act was a bit of a let down one that didn't live up to the lofty anticipation the first two led me into building.Alas these reservations of mine are what kept this film from becoming a real treat in my book and left it more in the realms of an entertaining ride of a lesser value for me. Still I don't regret I checked this one out for one second. Law and Caine both hand out terrific performances with Law outdoing even himself this time. This superb actor demonstrates a wide range of emotions on screen and tricking even good old cynic me in the second act at that. I really wish he'd gain more recognition for his ongoing work and the year end awards which are rapidly approaching are a good place to start. If the Academy will dismissignore his work here I'll be really disappointed this time around.Another good thing to keep your eye out for while checking this one out is the wonderful camera work and musical theme that haunt you throughout the feature. Special kudos goes to director Kenneth Branagh who shows us how a talky script could easy become a sufficient thriller by knowing when and where to place the camera and how to place the proper lighting and music in a given scene. It's this experience and technique that help turn 2007's Sleuth into an effective piece of work one that's worth taking a look at if not for the plot then to the very least for the powerful performances by Jude Law and Michael Caine and unique direction by Branagh.Watched at the International Haifa Film Festival Israel October 2007.".

I loved the original version and I had to see why the critics didn't like this rekindling from director Kenneth Branagh Henry V Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. It is pretty much the same format as the original struggling actor Milo Tindle Jude Law is going to see famous author of crime novels Andrew Wyke Sir Michael Caine at his hightech designer mansion to get permission to marry the wife who left him. Andrew agrees to go ahead with the divorce if Milo does something for him he wants him to create a realistic looking crime scene in his mansion i.e. play thief and steal an expensive piece of jewellery for their high value which he can use for him and Maggie. By the end of this realistic looking fake burglary however Andrew reveals it was all a mind game and with a gun pointed at him Milo begs him not to shoot but he does. A little later there is a knock at the door from a Detective who is investigating the disappearance of Milo and Andrew starts by lying about knowing him but eventually he tries to convince him that shots heard were part of a game. The detective dubs him as a murderer with evidence linking but of course he removes his glasses and moustache to reveal that it is actually Milo himself he has played a cleverly laid out mind game on Andrew just like he did to him almost like firing the blank bullet. This is where the film changes however the rest is brand new material Milo does not claim that he has murdered the woman he wants to marry he instead performs another fake murder to scare Andrew then Andrew tries a homoerotic seduction technique to get him on side and finally Milo gets shot for real and falls to his death with Maggie driving in outside. Also starring Harold Pinter as Man on T.V. Carmel O'Sullivan as Maggie apparently and Branagh as Other Man on T.V. Caine is reasonable taking over the role of his original costar Lord Sir Laurence Olivier and Law is okay in parts mostly in the disguise scene of course both would have been great if the film was better prepared. The scripting is pretty terrible especially the edition of unnecessary bad language the story doesn't have the fun nature like the original the unwinding of the games is silly and I completely agree that director Branagh doesn't know what direction the characters should go a rubbish remake mystery. Poor!".

By the end of this realistic looking fake burglary however Andrew reveals it was all a mind game and with a gun pointed at him Milo begs him not to shoot but he does. A little later there is a knock at the door from a Detective who is investigating the disappearance of Milo and Andrew starts by lying about knowing him but eventually he tries to convince him that shots heard were part of a game. The detective dubs him as a murderer with evidence linking but of course he removes his glasses and moustache to reveal that it is actually Milo himself he has played a cleverly laid out mind game on Andrew just like he did to him almost like firing the blank bullet. This is where the film changes however the rest is brand new material Milo does not claim that he has murdered the woman he wants to marry he instead performs another fake murder to scare Andrew then Andrew tries a homoerotic seduction technique to get him on side and finally Milo gets shot for real and falls to his death with Maggie driving in outside. Also starring Harold Pinter as Man on T.V. Carmel O'Sullivan as Maggie apparently and Branagh as Other Man on T.V. Caine is reasonable taking over the role of his original costar Lord Sir Laurence Olivier and Law is okay in parts mostly in the disguise scene of course both would have been great if the film was better prepared. The scripting is pretty terrible especially the edition of unnecessary bad language the story doesn't have the fun nature like the original the unwinding of the games is silly and I completely agree that director Branagh doesn't know what direction the characters should go a rubbish remake mystery. Poor!";

Playwright Anthony's Sleuth also requires a competent literary sleuth to figure out the multiple levels of meaning in a film that could be just about revenge if you looked no further. This brilliant adaptation by Pulitzerwinner and minimalist Harold Pinter contains his usual spare dialogue and non sequitur logic to provoke wonderment and amusement in a discerning audience that knows there's more than meets the eye and ear. Wealthy novelist Andrew Wyke Michael Caine is visited in his impressive estate by his wife's lover Milo Tindle Jude Law. From the first interchange about the superiority of Wyke's car which is placed nose to nose with Tindle's in an obviously figurative bird'seye shot the debate takes on a tennis metaphor where each combatant takes a set and the resolution becomes a tangled endgame.While it is easy to guess Shaffer has planned the author initially to be the manipulative superior as he guides his guest through one of the year's best set designs with its modern sharp edges and dazzling electronics the playfilm evolves with each character this is a two hander where not even the tennisball wife physically intrudes gets a chance to prove his worth for the absent but always present wife. Director Kenneth Branagh's closeups are merciless upon Caine's age lines emphasizing his wisdom and Law's beauty featuring his youthful volatility and vulnerability. But the prevalent high angle motif puts all the mayhem in perspective The cuckold will not be denied no matter how daring resourceful and remorseless the intruder is the men's sexuality will be challenged no matter how masculine the actors are. Ambiguity rules as it should in all effective literature and in life itself.While the screenplay is literate beyond anything out there all year the film belongs to the actors Law soaring beyond his Ripley charm and Caine even better than when he played Law's Tindle in a previous screen version 35 years ago.

	schema:reviewBody "Today marks the Remakes day where I take a look at two movies which are given an upto date treatment and not unlike the general others these have the creative forces back to lend certain credibility that it's not run of the mill product.First up is Sleuth where Michael Caine returns as one of the two roles but this time playing the other character opposite the one he was casted in the original making way to protg of sorts Jude Law to take over. It's quite interesting that this marks the second time that Law is playing a Caine character in a remake the first being the titular role in the movie Alfie. If this keeps up I guess by the time he rolls around his senior citizen age he might as well gun for the role of Alfred Pennyworth in a Batman movie.I have to admit that I was a bit apprehensive when I learnt of the running time of this remake that it's almost half of what the original was. I wondered which aspects of the original story would be summarized or worse compromised and in the worst case presented only one half of the story. And I was pleasantly surprised that this is not a blind shot for shot remake but one which retained the core essence while providing a very shiny glossy veneer to spice up the visuals. The original had looked too much of a stage play with quite gaudy sets but in Kenneth Branagh's update coupled with Harold Pinter working on the screenplay it became more posh and classy. And gone too is the creepily irritating clown.As stated earlier Michael Caine now plays Andrew Wyke a renowned novelist whose wife is having an affair with Jude Law's Milo Tindle a hairdresser. Wyke sets up a meeting with Tindle and the two begin to play a cat and mouse mind game relying on wit and trading gentlemanly insults laced with puns in a one upmanship fashion both out trying to prove their worth to each other and of course to stroke their own egos in the process. To tell you more will be to spoil the fun but suffice to say that things do get a little interesting and extreme as the story goes along at no time being boring Even though this is a remake it will not bore those who have watched the original as there's a little bit more explored and offered toward the end which will certainly raise some eyebrows and take you by surprise. Of course the tightening of the story helped and doesn't indulge too much on necessities that dragged the original. Chemistry between Caine and Law is excellent as they feed off each other's energies in fleshing their roles and Caine was actually more menacing than Laurence Olivier in the original as Andrew Wyke. Law on the other hand brings the usual roguish charm to Milo and in a particular scene I thought he probably would have been in contention as The Joker and should Christopher Nolan require someone to step into the late Heath Ledger's shoes then look no further  in any case Nolan has replaced actors for the same role before so it shouldn't really come as a surprise if the Joker character survives past The Dark Knight.Between the original and the remake I would prefer this version instead for its relatively more palatable run time and keeping things moving forward consistently. Being updated for the modern times also helped so if I were to recommend anyone interesting in watching Sleuth go for the remake instead. The score for the movie is also mesmerizing too and earns brownie points.".

Director Kenneth Branagh writer Harold Pinter and star  producer Jude Law deluded themselves that their prestige alone could sustain this travesty through an interminable 93 minutes without the fun or class of the longer original.Michael Caine enhanced his reputation playing the second lead in the marvelous 1972 film.

Looking puffy and washedout Caine glides through the part with less depth than he displays as Batman's butler. He had already lowered himself to a guest appearance in the atrocious remake of GET CARTER. What's next  ALFIE II or SON OF THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING? But then no one benefits from this inane adaptation by Pinter who thinks that frequent cursing and an added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of Shaffer's witty character interplay. Branagh's direction relies on bluish lighting and a soulless set design that wouldn't hold up in a secondrate nightclub. Neither the shadows nor the tight overacted closeups can help Law overcome his dull screen persona. The result is a failure both as straight drama and as detective thriller almost making you forget the purpose behind the title.Fans of the original stage production with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter and the Olivier  Caine film would do well to regard this enterprise as a bad dream. The late Mr Shaffer who wrote the 1972 screenplay as well as Hitchcock's FRENZY and several Agatha Christie adaptations must be turning in his grave wishing he could plan a real murder or two!".

That's one of the reasons I dislike this remake of a classic. When I watch a movie adapted a play I still must feel to see a movie and not just a play. Director Kenneth Brannigan did some marvelous movies in the past but this time he missed. Another reason was the look of the movie. The design was modern stylish clean uncomfortable and cold. I never got the feeling that somebody ever lived in that house. The photography wasn't bad but the lightening was awful. Sometimes there was blue light dark green light to round it up not friendly for eyes.The acting was really good. Michael Caine's and Jude Law's perform at their best. I really would like to see these 2 guys playing together on stage. But I have to confess I never was a fan of Jude Law. The weakest part was the mid part. I remember that in the original that this part was still very mysterious and just marvelous directed. I tried to watch it twice and always in the mid part I felt asleep. The end part is better and more interesting. Sleuth 2007 isn't awful but it seems to be more a movie for critics than for the audience. Sleuth 1972 is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than Sleuth 2007.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kenneth Branagh is known for great Laurence Olivier remakes. His last remake was 1991's Hamlet. 16 years later Branagh is adapting one of Olivier's most famous films Sleuth. He proves with his effective directing and camera techniques that he is still the greatest director for a remake. The film only has two actors the legendary Michael Caine as he reverses his role this time around. In this film the supposed Italian actor Milo Tindle is played by Jude Law. The film starts off with the camera cutting through security cameras throughout Wyke's Caine countryside estate. When Tindle arrives you find out that he is the lover to Wyke's wife. He simply asks for him to agree to a divorce but Wyke has much more planned than that. The film then spends the rest of its time playing out elaborate mind games of deceit and trickery that will keep you guessing until the last second.Usually I think it'd be hard to watch just two actors for almost 90min. To pull it off you'd have to have two incredibly strong actors to pull it off and they got the perfect people for it. Michael Caine brings Olivier's role a fresher sense of darkness and questionable attributes. While Jude Law easily proves that he is one of his generations top actors. For playing Caine's former performance Law is sufficient enough to keep the film going. During the second act of the film Law will surprise you with a stunning performance.Branagh's direction is somewhat courageous. He uses new camera techniques that haven't been seen before. Sleuth in some way is a dream for a cameraman. Branagh pulls off such interesting angles that it gives you different perspectives of what's going on in each scene. Whether your only line of sight is protruding through a set miniblinds it almost makes you feel like a peeping tom listening in on the mens conversation.The script written by Harold Pinter is filled with eloquent dialog that will entrance you. The character's flip flop from good to bad constantly so the dialog keeps you updated on who is winning the game. It also gives you a sense that there is a third character in the film. The house. It's incredibly high tech and is the reason for the same of the character's choices. Pinter also uses some of the designs in the house to help move the story along.However though towards the end of the second act it seems that the two characters start to get too caught up in their own games and the film does get a bit contrived. It lost my interest a little at the end as well. The film ends abruptly but leaves you hanging. After talking about everything my conclusion is that Sleuth is definitely one of the greatest remakes of all time. I give it an 8 out of 10".

When the original film version of SLEUTH appeared in 1972 fourletter words were just being introduced onto the silver screen but judging by Pinters excessive use of expletives in his adaptation one might be inclined to think that the famous writer has only just discovered them for himself! Another unwarranted addition is the utterly tasteless gay overtones which come to the fore in the finale and almost succeed in wrecking the whole movie.That the new version of SLEUTH is a misfire is unmistakable but that it is not a complete failure is mostly due to Michael Caines thespian skills and Kenneth Branaghs visual flair more on that later on. Again in the past there have been various instances where one of the principals in the original movie version is given a cameo in the remake  Victor Mature in SAMSON AND DELILAH 1984 TV Gregory Peck Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam in CAPE FEAR 1991 Charlton Heston in PLANET OF THE APES 2001 etc.  but here Michael Caine takes over Laurence Oliviers part.

On the other hand Jude Law once again steps inside Caines old shoes  having previously embodied the latters signature role of ALFIE 1966 in a 2004 remake a fact which surely must not have escaped the filmmakers or casting directors. Im not particularly fond of ALFIE myself so I havent bothered to watch the remake but I adore the original SLEUTH and I must say that Laws characterization in this newer version is an annoyingly overbaked one that fails to do justice to Caines interpretation in both movies.A clear indication of how poorly the Harold PinterKenneth Branagh film fares against the Anthony ShafferJoseph L. Mankiewicz one is a simple numerical one the latter is a hefty 139minutes long and virtually whizzes by while the formers 86 minutes feel like three solid hours! The first third is quite decent actually but after the highly ineffective Inspector Doppler segment the film sinks fast and not even the constantly mobile camerawork the everchanging color palettes and the futuristic nature of Caines interior design are able to keep tedium at bay for very long.".

The first third is quite decent actually but after the highly ineffective Inspector Doppler segment the film sinks fast and not even the constantly mobile camerawork the everchanging color palettes and the futuristic nature of Caines interior design are able to keep tedium at bay for very long.";

While most remakes of classics  or supposed classics  tend to be overstuffed and overlong as if bigger automatically makes better Branagh and his screenwriter Harold Pinter have taken a sharp scalpel to Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1972 version of Anthony Shaffer's stage play and skillfully whittled it down to the bare bones. It is not just that the material has been sliced down from the 138minute running time of Mankiewicz's version to a relatively sprightly 86 minutes Pinter has also trimmed away a lot of the cutesy dialogue and clumsy plotting that robbed the previous film of any sense of suspense or element of surprise.This sparse approach is evident immediately with the set design gone are the annoying bricabrac and childish clutter that made the 1972 version look as though it were taking place in a Victorian era toy shop all replaced with a stark and creepy mise en scne. The stately exterior of the Wyke mansion now conceals a cross between Gothic and hightech an interior that suggests Caligari meets Kubrick sort of postmodern Addams Family by way of Tim Burton. The country manor quaintness of the traditional murder mystery has been forfeited in favor of the icy bluegrays of a haunted house thriller. The game of cat and mouse that Shaffer originally concocted remains largely the same but the setting makes it clear that the pretense that it is a gentlemen's game is effectively shattered. Rather than a hokey comedy of con games this SLEUTH is intent on being a psychological drama of mind games.The first twothirds of the film adheres more or less to the outline of Shaffer's original tale mystery novelist Andrew Wyke invites actor Milo Tindle to his country estate with a business proposition. Tindle is the paramour of Wyke's estranged wife and he has come to persuade Wyke to grant her a divorce. Wyke has other more sinister matters on his mind. What unfolds at first is a rather simple scheme aimed at faking a robbery and defrauding an insurance company but this quickly gives way to a battle of wits based on lies and betrayals. Act one or rather Round 1 goes to Andrew while Milo comes back with surprising vengeance to take Round 2 with the deciding Round 3 up for grabs. Either wickedly funny or tiresomely contrived depending on one's respect for the material the original story relies heavily on the audience's willingness to accept the men as being either brilliant or gullible depending on which way Shaffer wants to throw it. The newer version doesn't take it for granted that the audience will be easily seduced into accepting that either man would be so blindly fooled by the other's transparent tricks and expects the stars to be credibly convincing and straightfaced serious while telling their respective lies.The filmmakers' bravest risk however comes in jettisoning the entire third act leaving behind the labored battle of wits in favor of a more direct emotional and physical confrontation. In a certain way this SLEUTH is less like its predecessor than it is like its thematic cousin Sidney Lumet's version of Ira Levin's DEATHTRAP as a homoerotic subtext has either been uncovered or totally invented. The mental oneupmanship of who will outsmart who evolves into a smart game of who will out who all played with a sadomasochistic twist. A story of two male rivals battling for the affections of an unseen  and ultimately irrelevant  woman suddenly becomes a predatory mating dance designed to make the viewer wonder if one or both or neither of the men are closet cases as well as mental cases.Much of whether this type of film works relies more on the actors than the story. Sir Laurence Olivier tackled the character of Andrew in the 1972 version and played the part too obviously as being either archly cunning in the way of a James Bond villain or as a simpering twit. Michael Caine more than held his own as Milo but here Caine now the elder statesman of British actors inherits the role of Wyke and he wears the role with greater ease. Being comfortably condescending when his Andrew is on the attack and believably unnerved when forced to reveal his vulnerable side Caine underplays deftly. His adversary is now Jude Law. Though roughly the same age as Caine was at that time Law now skews Milo much younger and plays him as much more of a quixotic explosive wild card  and proves to be better at assuming disguises. Caine's grim calm and Law's nervous energy create a contrast that lends their confrontations greater tension  sexual and otherwise. Caine and Law have much sharper rapport than Olivier and Caine did.Unfortunately while being leaner and meaner the new SLEUTH doesn't hold up to the end any better than the old SLEUTH because either way you still face a tough question  not of who is smarter than who but why should we care at all. There is nothing particularly likable or admirable about Andrew or Milo. Despite the fact that the characters beg for our sympathy at various points  win lose or draw  neither film ends with a sense of triumph or a sense of gleeful satisfaction or even an appreciation of the cruel irony. Even if you get sucked up into the funhouse gimmicks and hambone theatrics of the Mankiewicz's version you still have nothing but a silly trivial entertainment. At least the Branagh version takes risks by exploring a sexual undercurrent in the story and peels away the surface to find the cold hard center. But even so beyond respecting it's sense of style there is little reason to invest much emotional  or even intellectual  interest in the nasty little chess game that unfolds.".

There is also a French woman who has a near death experience and a troubled British boy grieving over the loss of a loved one.I am not a firm believer in a hereafter life or psychic abilities and what is great about this movie is that it addresses these issues in an intelligent way without asking the audience to debate their existence. Instead it focuses on the characters and how these issues affect their lives. There is nothing cheap or gimmicky about this movie. It simply tells a touching story without being overly sentimental. Clint Eastwood delivers a great picture and Matt Damon an excellent performance. The roundout cast deserves a bighand as well. Keep in mind that this is a character drama and like cooking a good sauce takes its time to develop a richness.

What with its catastrophic events and plot centric imagery you'd think Eastwood had made a disaster movie rather than what the reality turns out to be. This is a much more thoughtful film about death that examines how living characters deal with the aftereffects. Matt Damon's character Lonegan is not a protagonist but one character in a larger ensemble piece. Naturally it benefits marketing to try to isolate this certain aspect of the plot to make this look like a thriller but it is a impressionist character piece by all means. Even the psychic aspect is played down and never truly explained.What that reality turns out to be is something akin to one of the time centric French minimalists like Chantal Akerman and Jacques Rivette. While it never of course becomes a four hour movie about household chores like Jeanne Dielman it nevertheless is one of the most jarringly French arthouselike films to ever be released as a mainstream American film. Eastwood's decision to leave Peter Morgan's script as a rough first draft is likely part of what's drawing criticism but this is arguably what makes it so effective as well. Narrative coherence is spurned in favor of genuine CINEMA people behaving onscreen and showing the effects of great turmoil in every little nuance. Eastwood known for stripping down rewrites to maintain a certain spontaneous quality in his films and for shooting very few takes saw something in this script that he knew wouldn't make it to the final draft. This is how it maintains such a minimal quality.Of course such methodology is in tune with French filmmakers like Bresson a filmmaker who would likely be criticized today for his deadpan performances when what he's really doing is drawing attention to actions rather than performances. Eastwood puts a lot of stock in gesture hands in particular. Hands are prominently shown whenever a character embraces and they are also the method through which Lonegan is able to make contact with the afterlife. He tries to make connections through a cooking class in which he must make use of his hands and which inevitably leads him to touch the hands of others when he wants least to. There's also a generous use of exteriors with the running theme of loneliness in crowded locations which anybody whose experienced such trauma or even lesser traumas can relate to. It sounds like Eastwood is employing the dreaded preference of things to people but in reality this is a perfect melding of characters to their environment.None of this is the kind of postElia Kazan acting our country is used to but each of the actors do a remarkable job in communicating in this way. Damon gives the finest performance of his career and each of the supporting cast is remarkable as well in the way they REACT rather than act. A jarring change for the star of Gran Torino perhaps but one which works for the material.And that I think is why such mixed reactions come out of those who view this film. Eastwood is not making a heightened film about death but an understated despite its moments of sensationalism which serve as counterpoint exploration of how people deal with death. What makes it even more difficult is that despite an optimistic conclusion no definite resolution is ever reached. We never learn the nature behind Lonegan's abilities we only get hints at how it may have come about. No religious agenda is preached nor is religion rejected. Such open ended filmmaking is vastly beyond even limited releases and is usually the kind of stuff found on the Criterion Collection decades after its completion. To have a release like this is astounding but has likely doomed the film financially.That would be a shame. In a year that has produced solid work ranging from Sorkin and Fincher's The Social Network Martin Scorsese's woefully underrated Shutter Island and the hypedriven juggernaut that was Inception I think Hereafter ranks among the very best of the year. I would even go so far as to call it the first bonafide masterpiece of the decade. I suspect this places me at odds with many people some of whom have tried to logically argue with me why this was an incompetent film to them I would explain that film is not meant to be dictated by plot logic the most superficial aspect of filmmaking at best but as this film goes to show some things just can't be easily explained away.".

What I experienced was even more fascinating  and thought provoking  leading me to ask more questions than I would have answers.Hereafter presents you with fascinating characters  literally from the first few minutes of the film you find yourself both riveted and squirming to look away. Scenes from a vicious tsunami that takes the lives of hundreds of thousands leaves the viewer feeling shocked and empty  but what follows in the aftermath is what is truly astounding.The acting in this movie is absolutely superb. From Matt Damon's portrayal of George  a man who has abandoned his psychic gift or what he considers to be a curse for a more simple and obscure life as a factory worker... to Cecile De France's talented portrayal of Marie a French journalist who experiences a tragedy of such enormity you wonder how she will ever get back to living a 'normal' life... to young George and Frankie McLaren's work as the adorable Marcus and Jason  British twins who must contend with their mother's drug abuse and later a tragedy that will tear them apart  the viewer is left to feel as if they are literally part of the story. You rally for the characters  and yearn to see how their fate will unfold. The intersection of all of their lives is what is so fascinating.While I went into Hereafter expecting something a bit obscure and mindbending I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film is a drama that delves into not only the topic of life after death  but life itself. Clint Eastwood does an amazing job at giving us a look into the peace and mystery that awaits us on the other side... but also the joy and beauty of what is right in front of us.Hereafter was a pleasant surprise. While some questions remain at the end of the film I feel it is a perfect ending to a film about a topic as mysterious as life after death. At one point in the film Thierry Neuvic's character Didier makes the comment that if there were life after death it would have been proved by now. By the end of the film you realize that the most wonderful and amazing events in life cannot necessarily be proved  but with enough faith and through fate  everything lines up exactly as it should.".

	schema:headline " Incredibly intense subtle masterpiece.";
	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood has once again proved himself to be a formidable director. The style and structure of storytelling used in Hereafter will not appeal to a large audience but something tells me he knew this all too well but honestly didn't care and rightfully so. Because let's face it he can afford it and it's certainly a privilege he has earned. And with Hereafter it seems that all Mr. Eastwood wants to do is share a story. A very beautiful one at that.Hereafter is divided into three story lines spread over three different countries. We have Matt Damon as a reluctant psychic in the United States Ccile De France who plays a journalist in France and a young pair of twin brothers Frankie and George McLaren in England. All of these peoples' lives are in one way or another affected by different aspects of death whether that be a neardeath experience or the passing of someone very dear. Or in Damons case the ability to establish a certain connection with those who are no longer with us. Eastwood has decided on a particularly art houselike approach which like I mentioned earlier will certainly back off a large amount of potential viewers. However I personally very much appreciate his decision. He has obviously chosen not to make this some big hypedup monster movie about all things paranormal. Instead Hereafter deals with its subject with great integrity and subtlety. Although despite said subtlety it features a few moments which are by contrast incredibly intense and shocking in a nonscary way. In fact I would even go so far as to say it is not for the faint of heart but I mean that mostly in an emotional sense rather than a spectacular one. On a side note I would actually not recommend this film to anyone who has in any way shape or form been confronted with the 2004 tsunami or even the London terrorist attacks. It might be really confronting so be advised.I personally think the film's rating of 6.7 is a bit low but on the other hand I do somewhat understand why this film has not received the appreciation it deserves. Simply put not everyone actually many people will not understand it. It is a small story for a small audience. Also anyone watching this because they think it's all about Matt Damon will be somewhat deceived. I fully understand why they put his name and picture on the poster since he is the only big name on the payroll. But this is really not 'his' film he just plays a part in it. And he does it well but the rest of the cast actually deserves a great deal of credit because they are quite simply phenomenal. And I mean all of them. Ccile de France is really impressive she plays her part with great dignity and empathy. She truly carries every scene she's in and she will definitely do her country proud. Personally I was most affected both story and acting wise by the 'London segment' of the film. The story of the two young brothers is absolutely heartbreaking and the McLaren boys do a superb job at translating this onto the screen. Anyone who doesn't at least feel a shudder of emotion when watching their story unfold well... honestly doesn't have a lot of heart. I refuse to give away any plot points at all other than what I already have. This is really the kind of story you just need to surrender to in order to really appreciate it. The pacing demands some patience but if this is your kind of film it really won't be too much trouble and you will be greatly rewarded.The way the story unfolds the threeway structure which doesn't come together until the very end inevitably evokes comparison to 'Babel' but honestly that one cost me a far greater deal of effort to sit through than Hereafter. But that is entirely personal of course and the structure is really the only similarity between the two the stories are completely different. And I also think Hereafter is actually far more accessible than Babel despite its subject matter. The stories are told with such tenderness that it didn't actually bother me at all that they were three separate stories which until the end had nothing to do with each other. They all intrigued me in their own personal way.Actually I could go on and on...It's been a long time since a film has really touched my heart but this one has. I've been thinking about what rating I should give it but honestly I can't think of a single reason why I wouldn't give this film a 10. Hereafter is a film of true beauty a real gem. Which unfortunately won't be understood by many people but who knows... Perhaps someday its time will come.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. One of the advantages to not being dependent upon movie reviews for food and shelter is that there is no concern for a superstar holding a grudge against me and my opinions. Make no mistake director Clint Eastwood is a Hollywood powerhouse and also one of the most consistently fine filmmakers working today. Still no one bats a thousand ... this is a miss with barely a swing.The film follows three basic stories. The first revolves around George Lonegan Matt Damon who seemingly has true psychic abilities. The problem is that George does not wish to have anything to do with his powers. The second involves twin brother Marcus and Jason who live with their druggie mom. Things change quickly when Jason is hit and killed by a truck and Marcus is taken away while his mom rehabs. The third story has Marie LeLay Cecile De France as an investigative reporter who gets caught in a tsunami while vacationing and has a near death experience.I will not go into detail for any of the three stories other than to say Jay Mohr plays Damon's moneygrubbing brother who wants to take his talent to the big time the sadness of the surviving twin is tough to take at times as he searches for a connection to his dead brother and lastly Marie's neardeath brings her closer to life than she ever was before.What is most surprising given the pedigree of Eastwood and writer Peter Morgan The Queen Last King of Scotland is that this movie and each of these stories are for lack of a better word quite boring. We really get little insight into any of the characters  other than the overall sadness each shows regularly. The substory with the most interest involves a brief encounter with a secret research clinic sporting a Nobel Prize winner. The clinic evidently has much research and data on this topic.As you have already guessed these three stories intersect near the film's end. This is a ploy that is all too common in Hollywood these days. I won't give away how it all comes together but it bordered on eyerolling. The film does not depend upon the viewer's beliefs or understanding though I personally believe some people do have a heightened sense of awareness and connection. That's not really what it's about. It's more about sadness loneliness and the need for personal connection while alive.As usual Mr. Eastwood has put together a terrific score. And I will gladly admit that the first 710 minutes of the film including the tsunami were captivating ... and I loved the connection with Charles Dickens. That's the best I can offer for the film and here's hoping Eastwood's biopic on J Edgar Hoover brings significantly more interest and entertainment value.".

	schema:reviewBody "The pacing of this film did not bother me. Of course I am over 50 so I can actually sit still through a slower paced storyline that includes a number of different characters without something blowing up or someone getting undressed to keep my attention.What did bother me perhaps comes from a unique view from others reviewing the film. As one who has experienced an NDE I was disappointed with both the flimsy and undeveloped view of the female lead's experience and the ambiguous way in which her story unfolded.On one hand we have a character whose NDE was so lifealtering as to divert her from her primary job as a political reporter into someone who writes a book extolling the difficulty in revealing the truth in the modern media world about the validity of the NDE experience. The dust jacket on her book as well as casual references to her research talk about all of the expert testimony that support the overwhelming facts about NDE experiences and the correlation between science and the afterlife. And thenthe movie tells us nothing.The script or perhaps what was left after Eastwood edited the script simply glosses over anything substantial in the way of research except to talk about a Nobel laureate who was ridiculed after revealing his research. One line...out of over two and a half hours of script.The question to me is why start the conversation if you aren't going to offer even a small slice of the answers? The research is voluminous. Those of us who have experienced an NDE know that it is far more than a chemical reaction to the body starting to shut down. Much more.But all we are left with in this movie is a lead character who doesn't want to acknowledge his gift even in the face of those around him who believe in a hereafter more than he does.Anyone who has experienced an NDE will find this movie sadly unfulfilling. But perhaps it will bring many more of us to admit to what happened and start a much more meaningful dialogue about the facts.As a few of the younger reviewers mentioned a vast majority of the audience was over 50. No doubt many of those there were looking for answers about the aferlife for one reason or another. It would have been a great chance to tell the world something substantial. But in the end the movie was a nice idea with slow execution...and painfully unfulfilling.".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems to me that the majority of the positive user reviews here on IMDb for Hereafter seem to have some bias for the fact that this movie was directed by Clint Eastwood who also provided the music. If you prefer your movie reviews to be based on the movie itself it would be in your best interest to ignore such reviews because for the most part they rate the film with way more regard than it deserves. As a survivor of trauma I went to see Hereafter hoping to find something that could relate to what I and those like me experience on a daily basis. However the film only slightly begins to some close. Unfortunately it comes up dismally short and that obviously was not by design. There is no heart in this movie none. Yes the opening catastrophic scene is quite gripping and well executed. However well before you get to the end you realize that it was dramatically out of place with the rest of the feel of this film. Once the film establishes the defining moments that sets the three main characters off on this narrative journey the rest of the way to the conclusion of the film is loosely comprised of personal experiences that hardly give their protagonists any depth or emotion. Not to mention that the pacing of and transition between these experiences seems if anything random and inconsequential. Ccile De France's character seems hardly driven or affected by the severity of her trauma to motivate her subsequent life altering actions with any passion. Matt Damon seems detached throughout bouncing along as emotionless as a tumbleweed until towards the end of the film when he finally takes the all to predictable risk of coming out of his shell. The casting of the McLaren brothers almost comes across as a ploy. In that I mean it seems that they decided to cast actors lacking talent and emotional range so that it was to be perceived as emotional numbness. However in most moments when we need to see that they have something more to offer than melancholy they come up short. With intonation that seems to be like that of boys being forced to read for the part of a daisy in the middle school play the boys mumble their words. Most of the only emotion to be perceived is derived strictly from the visuals and situations their characters experience you'll see.These characters' destinies roll down a slope with the incline of a driveway until they reach the curb that is their coming together. Note this is NOT a spoiler it is pretty obvious that this is the inevitable outcome. If showing that people can be made numb after the experience of something traumatic is the main purpose of this film then it does so fairly well. However with nothing in the way of contrast this just comes across as boredom.I know it probably seems at this point that I hate this film. I don't. It's a fine AVERAGE movie a decent escape during the time that it runs. It certainly isn't worthy of the high praise that many of the other reviewers on IMDb have bestowed upon it. It's my hope that my review balances out the IMDb opinion pool.Also a note to Clint The music is dismal. Any attempt to make it understated and poignant resulted in something that brings up memories of cheesy 70's romantic tearjerkers. You should have forsaken you ego and left it up to someone else.See or wait? Wait for the DVD".

	schema:reviewBody "Eastwood's Hereafter is going to be a love it or hate it affair. It is remarkably different from anything he's directed before and remarkably superior to previous similar efforts from Inarritu etc to relate globally dispersed yet ultimately intertwined character driven stories.I am someone who does not believe that there is such a thing as life after death. As skeptical as I am about it I also know that I cannot possibly prove that there is no such thing. Hereafter didn't change my mind about this one bit but that didn't stop me from deeply enjoying and appreciating the story that Eastwood and Morgan had to tell.So much has been said about the leisurely and meandering pace of the film which I find to be pointless observations. Many of these same reviewers completely failed to grasp that the astonishing mostly firstperson tsunami sequence was supposed to have happened in Thailand not Maui where the practicals were shot based on the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. It's equally clueless of these same commentators to characterize the terror elements of Herefter as being post911 when terrorist attacks against civilians have been going on around the world before and since 911. The terror incident portrayed in Hereafter is clearly based on the 2005 London Tube bombings known over there as 77. No one not even a ghost in Hereafter predicted it. Finally some of these same reviewers fault Matt Damon's George Lonegan for not being a future seeing clairvoyant when his one and only supernatural ability is limited to channeling the dead under very specific circumstances. For these impatient chroniclers all of these details must have rushed by too slowly for them to have noticed at all. The fundamental story revolves around three kinds of loss.Cecile De France's silverspooned French TV journalist Marie LeLay dies skeptics would say she has a neardeath outofbody experience and then miraculously comes back to life when active efforts to revive her have failed. Her experience of crossing over and back gradually comes to overthrow nearly everything in her previously selfassured and selfdetermined Parisian life.Damon's Lonegan rightfully considers his ability to channel the dead as being a curse. Modern medicine has boiled his condition down to a form of childhood braininjury induced schizophrenia to be controlled through the use of powerful medications that render him feeling lifeless. Refusing to medicate his unmuted talent results in his ongoing alienation from the rest of everyday humanity  that humanity having a high propensity for shooting messengers. In the meanwhile he lives an economically precarious blue collar life in San Francisco and listens to Charles Dickens audio books as a substitute for sleep. All of this is portrayed with deft understatement by Damon.Reallife identical twins George and Frankie McLaren portray twelveminutes separated twins Jason and Marcus who are engaged in a spirited battle to prevent London's Child Services from taking them away from their beloved opiate addicted mother Lyndsey Marshall who self medicates between fixes with alcohol. The younger Marcus who has always deferred to his older brother becomes a lost halfsoul when Jason unexpectedly dies while returning from an hope filled errand that Marcus was initially asked to undertake for their mother. Jason was filling a prescription that would begin their mother's fight against addiction. The same tragedy results in Marcus being placed in a foster home. So he loses his mom too. No matter how high functioning Marcus seems to be in his determination to reconnect with Jase he is deep in the grip of shock and grief. All of the other elements of Hereafter serve to underscore and develop each character's profound sense of loss as well as their respective quests to fill their voids with meaningful answers. There's a very Dickensian feel to this too. Bryce Dallas Howard delivers an inspired turn as Melanie George's night school cooking partner and potential romantic interest. Some reviewers have criticized Howard for overly hammy bad acting when in fact she perfectly nails the part of a hypomanic speeddater rushing headlong into something she desires but is too wounded by a traumatic past to be able to handle. It's all seemingly unbelievable... until you've met people in reallife who are just like Melanie. As such I think Howard's interpretation was something courageous.The acting is so relaxed and natural you almost don't realize that it's a direct by product of Eastwood's mostly onetake approach to film making. Every actor is delivering their Agame. If I were permitted more than 1000 words here I would go into more detail about that. Suffice it to say that no one is phoning anything in. As for how things tie up at the London Book Fair and the fairy tale ending between Marie and George I have no qualms. She's died and come back so George's curse becomes his unique means of understanding what happened to Marie in a way that no one else can. To me that is something lyrical if not poetic.Hereafter delivers no answers whatsoever about the afterlife but it does conclude with three bright notes of new beginnings. In that some might see the work of a benevolent divine hand. I saw three decent souls who chose to never give up. One does not contradict the other. I urge you to see it and decide for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll be honest with you the trailers for Hereafer never really grabbed me. But with the only other major release this weekend being Paranormal Activity 2 the original of which scared the living daylights out of me I opted for something a little tamer. Besides Clint Eastwood has proved time and again to be a brilliant director and I like Matt Damon quite a bit. How could a movie involving the two of them possibly be bad right? So much for logic...Hereafter opens with the deceptively bucolic scenes of a tropical paradise. Popular French reporter Marie DeLay Cecile De France is vacationing with her boss and lover Didier Thierry Neuvic. Just before the couple is set to return to Europe they become among the thousands of victims of a deadly tsunami. Marie in particular has a very close call and despite being relatively uninjured and back at work she simply can't get past what she claims to have experienced during the course of her near death experience.George Lonegan Matt Damon lives on the other side of the world where he's a factory worker in San Francisco with a bizarre bent for Charles Dickens novels. Though George is purportedly one of the few psychics around who's actually not a fraud he wants nothing to do with talking to the dead any more. His brother Billy Jay Mohr is all too aware of the money that can be made should George take up doing readings again and he does everything possible to convince his brother that he ought to use his gift despite the fact George himself considers it more of a curse.Meanwhile in London a pair of twin boys named Marcus and Jason FrankieGeorge McClaren are dealing with difficult circumstances at home. Things only get worse for Marcus when he loses someone close to him and sets himself on a mission to find out anything he can about life after death and communications with the dead.The three stories obviously come together late in the film but getting there is tedious at best and the resolution can only be described as anticlimactic. The actors are good the script isn't bad and the direction and cinematography are excellent special kudos go to the special effects wizard who created an extraordinarily believable disaster with the tsunami and its aftermath. So what's the problem? I was bored.Hereafter moves at a crawl. The subject was kept nebulous enough that I never really got all that interested in it and I frankly didn't care much about any of the characters either. That's no reflection on the capabilities of the actors who were uniformly quite good but rather the onedimensionality of the characters they played. In the midst of death I found myself wondering if I'd remembered to put cat food on the grocery list and whether or not I'd have time on Saturday to get a pedicure. Yes I was that bored.BOTTOM LINE When Hereafter ended the audience was largely silentand not in a good way. On my way out the door I heard the couple behind me talking about the movie and one said Well that was a waste of time! I couldn't have summed it up better myself. In fact the only reason Hereafter gets four stars is because the cinematography is indeed brilliant. ADDED NOTE Critical reviews of Hereafter have been largely quite positive. While I'm at a loss to give you one single good reason to see the movie others disagree.POLITICAL NOTES None USrelated there is some talk of former French leader Mitterand.FAMILY SUITABILITY Hereafter is rated PG13 for mature thematic elements including disturbing disaster and accident images and for brief strong language. Kids of all ages will be bored out of their minds during Hereafterand if you're a parent you know what happens when kids get bored! While the rating is largely appropriate and older kids would be just fine from a parental guidance perspective I'm still not willing to recommend Hereafter to anyone of any age for any reason. Sorry.".

While I'm at a loss to give you one single good reason to see the movie others disagree.POLITICAL NOTES None USrelated there is some talk of former French leader Mitterand.FAMILY SUITABILITY Hereafter is rated PG13 for mature thematic elements including disturbing disaster and accident images and for brief strong language. Kids of all ages will be bored out of their minds during Hereafterand if you're a parent you know what happens when kids get bored! While the rating is largely appropriate and older kids would be just fine from a parental guidance perspective I'm still not willing to recommend Hereafter to anyone of any age for any reason. Sorry.";

Her character is totally lame and unlikable and so is that douche she's dating in the film and worst of all the subplot is boring as hell. She just spends time thinking about her magical escape from death in the opening tsunami scene which should have been looped continuously for two hours as it would have been better than the BS we got.Then you have Matt Damon's subplot which plays like a really bad episode of Ghost Whisperer. Seriously he should have won a razzie his performance here is so bad it's beyond surrealism. He is basically this psychic who can talk to dead people and he meets this messed up hot chick in an Italian Cooking school a subplot within a subplot that is soon left to die. I really can't remember what happened in this subplot it was so damned uninteresting.The ONLY interesting story was the British kid. I'll admit this movie was a bit of a nostalgic rush for me which may be why it gets one star as opposed to 0 because a week before I watched this movie I was in London and Paris for vacation. But this was an interesting substory as he loses his twin brother lives with a drugaddled mother and has trouble adjusting to life with a new family. I'll admit there were a few humorous scenes and his search to talk to his brother was interesting and had me wanting to know more. Actually the movie could have been this and it would have worked a solid 35 off the bat.And then the ending where it all comes together is just LAME!!!! If I am going to sit through a movie with 3 subplots with only one being even remotely interesting I want a satisfactory conclusion. And don't get me started on the Romantic Comedy pukefest of an ending. It brought back painful memories of The Tourist.I really love Clint but this film was just an embarrassment on every level. This came from the same Clint Eastwood who gave us the amazing Gran Torino bear in mind. I don't even think replacing Matt Damon with Jennifer Love Hewitt would have saved the film.".

Here as it was the case in Changeling the children seem kind of lost. Bryce Dallas Howard makes a bizarre contribution to the film. Unconvincing and down right annoying. And I must say I miss opening credits. I hope this fashion ends quickly. The appearance of Martha Keller took me out of the picture. I recognized the face but I couldn't put a name to it. The nagging thought distracted me away from the story. A problem that with opening credits could easily have been avoided. I'm rambling. I liked the film and Eastwood should be applauded.

The worst scene was when one of the twin brothers was sent to the pharmacy to pick up something for his mom. It's obvious something bad is going to happen to him because this is a movie about the afterlife he decides to go instead of his brother at the last second and all along the way to the shop he's talking to his brother on the cell phone about how great it is that his mom is about to quit doing drugs and that finally everything was starting to look up for their family! Seriously this happened. A child could have written this. I knew before the boy left his house that he was going to be struck by a car. Anybody who has ever seen a movie would know this.

It's almost an insult that the movie wraps up sensibly given that nothing is ever at stake in the film and the characters though welldrawn don't have anything of any importance to accomplish. I get the feeling that the people who rated this highly either 1 have recently experienced a death or 2 are about to experience a death.

I read a lot of good scripts. The fact that Hollywood in general can't distinguish a good script from a rambling mess is why a larger percentage of entertainment dollars is going to video games and reality shows.

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood is always throwing his films in the crowd of onlookers as if it were a bomb or a good uppercut or some kind of blackmailing session of arm twisting. And this Hereafter trip into dead territory and death's kingdom is one more provocation right in our faces.What is there beyond death? A beyond or hereafter that no one knows except a few who have been able to come back but who are regarded by people as some kind of zombies or crazy ranting and raving extraterrestrials. He takes a little of Dead Zone by Stephen King and he turns his film into a journey across the world from San Francisco to London and Paris where we meet three exceptional beings. A twin brother who has lost his twin in some ugly road accident. A TV anchorwoman who has died in a tsunami and managed to come back. And a medium who suffered some health problem in his youth and died a couple of times or more on the operating table.The whole film will aim at bringing the three together one way or another and make them discover there is something even some life beyond those deadly and fatal events. At the same time he settles some long deserved accounts with a few people among others French publishers who are as frigid as for publishing kinky things as old spinsters who have dedicated their whole lives to looking at the tip of their shoes. Jean Yves Berteloot in that role is cruel and so realistic that he is truer than truth itself. And we can think of absolutely all French publishers as being some rancid loveless and heartless old crumbs lost under a pile of rotting wood.But the film is also a good fist blow right into the noses of the audience. Terrifying pictures of a tsunami we used to say tidal wave in the old days all the more frightening because of the recent Japanese tsunami. Horrifying pictures of death death in the hands of that natural cataclysm death in the hands of an underground catastrophe in London death in the hands of some bullies against a younger child causing his deadly fate in the middle of the street death in the hands of heroin the famous horse that stampedes and gallops more often and longer than we can imagine.And yet Clint Eastwood wants us to believe there is some bright side in that story. The medium who cannot have a normal life since he can't touch anyone without being transported into their hereafter and therebefore will be saved by love. The forlorn twin will find solace in his own dead brother who will know more about life than the living now he is dead. The TV anchorwoman who will find love and hope in someone who can see beyond the surface. Even the horrid horse will find its master in the hands of some good doctors.Clint Eastwood's realism is the main power and force in this film. He whips you around with pictures so true that they become divine with truth and life together. And you better say thank you to the old man who is there to show the future in the past and the present in the visionary ranting and raving of the insane and we are all insane somewhere so we are all aware of the present the past and the future but 99.99 of these people are 200 sure death is the final end of life. Well I am ready to bet it is not though when I know I won't be able to cash my bet.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

Based on the trailers I had a feeling it could be a bad film but nonetheless with both Matt Damon and Clint Eastwood behind it I decided to give it a try. Let's put it this way the best part of the movie is the first 10 minutes after that it's all downhill. Save your money and skip this movie. It is truly that awful. People that give this movie a 10 on IMDb must be connected to this movie. The story doesn't flow well as if there is something missing oh ya the story itself was missing. It's almost as if Clint himself forgot what he was directing from scene to scene. I never read the book but based on this movie I never will. The editing is badly done too. One scene shows Matt Damon eating breakfast at his house next scene shows people walking by a building next scene goes to one of the other characters then back to another character then back to and outside shot it was like this all the way thru. It was long slow and frankly pointless. Very disappointed with Clint on this one guess he was due for a flop.".

Okay so it's not much like a Carry On film but it does make for a good two hours' watching Weaver fans will get a particular kick out of her rendition of Back In The U.S.S.R. and Hackman fans will enjoy seeing him upstage everyone except for Hewitt's anatomy I gave this 7 out of 10 but I should have given this an 8 purely on that count.

	schema:reviewBody "A movie that proves that what you see is not necessarily what you get as a motherdaughter team con one wellheeled member of the opposite sex after another in Heartbreakers' directed by David Mirkin and starring Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Yes the con is on as mom takes em to the altar daughter seduces em getting caught in the act by mom of course and mom settles for a divorce and some big bucks.  For the women it's like having the goose that laid the golden egg and all is going well the bucks are rolling in and Cupid's path is being littered in their wake with the carnage of the men they've despoiled.  Then Page Hewitt much to the chagrin of her mother Angela Weaver decides it's time to strike out on her own and take down a score for herself.  But as fate luck chance or whathaveyou would have it at that moment the IRA steps in and not only wipes out their bank account but hands them a bill for back taxes that far and away exceeds the amount already confiscated.  At that point what's a girl to do but find another mark.  Only this time it has to be one rich beyond their wildest dreams.  And with that the hunt is on.An amusing and at times hilarious comedy the fact that it works as well as it does can be attributed to two things by category  Weaver and Hewitt and Ray Liotta and Jason Lee.  For what the movie lacks in originality is made up for with the performances of the aforementioned four.  As far as the women such a pair of femmes fatales you've never seen Hewitt has it and flaunts it but she's still overshadowed by the gorgeous Weaver.  Looks aside however what really makes it cook is their shared ifyouseemecomin'betterstepaside takenoprisoners attitude a Mae West meets Kate Hepburn persona that gives their con its zing.  Weaver plays it to the hilts saucy seductive and sharp as a tack.  And not to be outdone by her costar Hewitt stays right there with her by giving a performance that makes you believe that this is a young woman who could actually pull this stuff off.  Together their antics on screen are reminiscent of Lemmon and Curtis in Some Like It Hot' or Caine and Martin in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'  There's a refreshing lack of pretentiousness about them that really makes them fun to watch.As for the guys Liotta gives a sharp performance as Dean a guy with a hard edge and a soft spot for Angela and Lee does a notable turn as Jack a regular guy who finds himself in the eye of Angela and Page's storm.  Lee has an especially engaging screen presence and some of the most memorable moments of the film are in the scenes he shares with Hewitt. Last but far from least Gene Hackman scores some guffaws as billionaire tobacco magnate William Tensy.  He gets a bit tongueincheek with his character who with his tobacco stained teeth and smoker's cough is at the same time hilarious and repulsive.  When Angela demurs his attempted kiss you'd swear you can smell his breath and the reek of smoke from his clothes. And you have to give Hackman credit for this one because to play this role all vanity had to be stuffed in the closet for the duration. The supporting cast includes Anne Bancroft Barbara Jeffrey Jones Mr. Appel Nora Dunn Miss Madress Julio Oscar Mechoso Leo Carrie Fisher Mrs. Surpin Ricky Jay Dawson's Auctioneer and Elya Baskin Vladimir. Director Mirkin must be given credit for his imaginative approach to some fairly unoriginal material and for making up for it's lack of substance by extracting some top performances from his actors.  The real strength of Heartbreakers' however is the fact that it never takes itself too seriously.  If you look deep enough you may find some insight into human nature but for the most part this is a movie that was made with nothing but fun in mind.  It's entertaining there's some laughs and some nice moments and it's easy on the eyes.  If you let it it's a movie that will let you off the hook for awhile and show you a good time.  And for my money that's not such a bad deal.  I rate this one 710.".

	schema:headline " Screwball comedy Hackman steals the show";
	schema:reviewBody "This screwball comedy brings together some great dramatic actors in unaccustomed comedic roles.  The results are mixed but mostly good with some terrific slapstick and some pure drivel.  Maxine Sigourney Weaver and Paige Jennifer Love Hewitt are two very slick con artists who find rich patsies and marry them only to divorce them for big settlements after enticing them into indiscretions.  When they get nabbed by the IRS for not paying their taxes they must score one more time to climb out of their financial mess.  The target is chain smoking billionaire William B. Tensy Gene Hackman who is dying before our eyes of lung disease.  The only question is whether Maxine can get him to propose before he keels over. Meanwhile Paige is running her own scam on Jack Jason Lee who owns a bar resting on prime real estate worth 3 Million.It is mostly pratfall humor with lots of sight gags and general nuttiness which is often uproariously funny.  The whole idea that the diminutive Paige could have been spawned from the Amazonian Maxine is implied comedy at its finest leading us to conclude that Paige's father could only have been a midget.Gene Hackman completely steals the show as the wheezy billionaire.  Hackman who is one of our national treasures as a dramatic actor shows magnificent range and he turns out to be the best comedian of the bunch.  Sigourney Weaver is also in rare form brandishing some bodacious outfits and undergarments.  She is especially funny as Olga trotting out impressive broken English and even doing some vocals accompanied by a Russian balalaika band.  Ray Liotta gives a lighthearted and funny performance as a chop shop owner who can't get over his love for Maxine even though he knows she scammed him.  Jason Lee's understated nice guy portrayal serves as the perfect counterpart to Jennifer Love Hewitt's bratty vamp.  The perennially cute Hewitt still can't seem to transition into grownup roles.  No matter how sexy they make her up and they do quite a good job with her considerable attributes her pubescent mannerisms and delivery still make her come off as a teenage harpy.  In her defense this is what the role required but it doesn't do much to move her out of her character rut.Overall there is a lot of good fun here that is often dissipated by puerile absurdity.  Still there are plenty of laughoutloud moments mostly delivered by Weaver and Hackman that make this a better than average comedy.  I rated it 710.  Fans who like seeing Sigourney and Jennifer in sexy outfits will not be disappointed.".

Sigourney Weaver is so funny I was in stitches listening to her as olga. What I did find confusing though was her constant hair colour and length change. One minute its long and red the next like a bob and blonde was it a wig if so where was the indication!!!! Her rendition of back in the U.S.S.R was hilarious yet catchy. Ray Liotta Gene Hackman and Jason Lee as the lovestruck victims are perfectly cast.In the scene where Jennifer Love Hewitt is on the bed sleeping and opens her eyes crying I was and still am choked when I see it.

	schema:reviewBody "HEARTBREAKERS  2001  out of fourStarring Sigourney Weaver Jennifer Love Hewitt Ray Liotta Jason Lee Jeffrey Jones Gene Hackman Nora Dunn and Anne Bancroft. Directed by David Mirkin. Written by Robert Dunn Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur. Produced by John Davis and Irving Ong. Rated PG13 for sexual content and language. Released by MGM Productions.It is becoming a genuine tradition for movies with sexy stars and seductive content to believe that males of all ages view the world not with their brain but with the external organ between their legs. Heartbreakers does a convincing job at persuading us to agree if we guy audience members can ourselves get past the ample amounts of cleavage and sexy dialogue inhabiting by this PG13 rated comedy that contains enough suggestive material and revealing midriffs for many parents to pause over. The film is another motherdaughter story about letting your children grow upbut disguised itself as a hilarious comedy about sensuous swindlers who make their own luck. It makes us laugh because of the irony of its situations and it makes us smile because of the knowledge of the writing by Robert Dunn Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur. Heartbreakers is easily one of the funniest comedies of the year.The film stars Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer LoveHewitt as Max and Page two conniving con artists who use their good looks to get what they want. As the movie opens Max is married to smalltime Jersey womanizer Dean Cumanno Ray Liotta but the marriage is short lived when Max shows up at his office the next day only to find her newlywed fooling around with an attractive younger womanher daughter Page. The whole act was a setup for a abrupt and easy divorce settlement with the two doubledealers coming away from the act with their pockets overloaded with threehundred thousand dollars and a really nice car.Page is growing up and wants to start a business on her own but her mother thinks she is not yet ready and finds them both in a demanding circumstance the IRS needs lots of money real soon from Max and Page. A spiteful agent Anne Bancroft explains that their accounts have been drained and criminal charges are about to be pursued. Page coincides to help her mother with one last job in order to pay off the alleged debts. They find the perfect target in Palm Beach an aging tobacco exec named William B. Tensy Gene Hackman who is worth over twenty million. Although neither Page or Max find this smelly chain smoking old man particularly attractive Max poses as a Russian aristocrat named Ulga Yevanova while Page finds her way with Tensy as a revealing housekeeper for his local mansion.This last job ultimately poses a few problems for Max and Page. Max finds herself followed  by Dean who seeks another martial bliss. Page finds herself falling in love with the kindhearted owner of a local bar Jason Lee who is worth three million dollars. Max wants her to go for his pocketbook but Page really has feelings for this personeven though romance is against her better judgment. The two must decide how to deal with these situations all while persuading Tensy to further fall for Max in attempt to pay off the IRS.Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sigourney Weaver deliver performances that are both sexy and funny. They are also very well cast making perfect and believable motherdaughter chemistry. There are also some funny performances from the strong supporting cast. Gene Hackman makes a fool out of himself with a character on the other side of the world from anything he has recently done. The charismatic young actor Jason Lee Almost Famous Mumford furnishes a convincing romantic interestalthough there is little chemistry between Hewitt and him. Anne Bancroft The Graduate Great Expectations fits in with the crowd gleefully. Other small roles from Jeffrey Jones The Devil's Advocate Sleepy Hollow as a hotel manager and Nora Dunn Three Kings as a maid framed for house robbing her own employer are also entertaining.Director David Mirkin struck out with the 1997 comedy Romy and Michele's High School Reunion but here captures the perfect tone for the comic material. Hearty laughs are frequent and bigand it takes a lot to make melaugh. The film prospers with a script that provides its amusing characters with many active situations and plot twists that are unanticipated and effective. Eventually however the film becomes rapped up in a sappy love story that somewhat gets in the way of the comedy. The movie's tone becomes a little too serious and we end up feeling cheated out of even more boisterously entertaining moments.When it comes to getting tons of laughs out of the audience the film prospers with no problems. Hewitt and Weaver make great career moves especially after they each tried their strings with failed serious films Weaver's past several Alien movies have bombed and Hewitt could not do a thing with I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. Heartbreakers contains enough effective comic material to warrant more than a single viewing. It is one of the best comedies of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "Funny how easily guys can be fooled by women but this movie is all about that. Tragically some women can't be trusted especially when they're working on man's weakness by using temptation.The movie takes maximum advantage of all the funny things that can happen when a mother and daughter team of marriage con goes out to dig the gold out of rich men. Unfortunately the daughter falls for incorruptible decent bar owner. But the plan is still to con the guy into being seduced by the mother who's pretending to be the cousin of her own daughter on the night of the wedding of the daughter to the bar owner.The movie is a comedy but hits close to home about how men can be conned by having wool put over their eyes in the name of love and by some forceful means. That's what makes this movie an extra delight to watch.The movie is actually a love comedy with a twist and lives up to both the comedy and romance aspect of the story as well.Jennifer Hewitt and Sigourney Weaver puts on great performance as well as the supporting casts.Great movie that I wish they made more of its kind.".

Tragically some women can't be trusted especially when they're working on man's weakness by using temptation.The movie takes maximum advantage of all the funny things that can happen when a mother and daughter team of marriage con goes out to dig the gold out of rich men. Unfortunately the daughter falls for incorruptible decent bar owner. But the plan is still to con the guy into being seduced by the mother who's pretending to be the cousin of her own daughter on the night of the wedding of the daughter to the bar owner.The movie is a comedy but hits close to home about how men can be conned by having wool put over their eyes in the name of love and by some forceful means. That's what makes this movie an extra delight to watch.The movie is actually a love comedy with a twist and lives up to both the comedy and romance aspect of the story as well.Jennifer Hewitt and Sigourney Weaver puts on great performance as well as the supporting casts.Great movie that I wish they made more of its kind.";

	schema:reviewBody "Mercenary motheranddaughter Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer LoveHewitt have cruised their way through life by cheating money out of various men with the tactic of mother marrying rich man then conveniently catching him with another woman the strategically placed daughter. This way only gets them so far when fresh of such a con with Ray Liotta their hard earned cash is taken right out of their hands from their dear friends the IRS and they decide to target the big guns in the form of multibillionaire Gene Hackman.With a tacky premise such as this it may seem somewhat of an embarrassment to have some talents and Jennifer LoveHewitt involved. But it pays off surprisingly well. Heartbreakers is not a film that tries to be revolutionary in any way just good entertainment and that it is. Weaver is hilarious as the oldage goldigger and Gene Hackman coughs and curses appropriately through his carcinogenic repulsive richman. But for quality comedic turns the best is by Ray Liotta as the resentful ex who refuses to forgive and forget who apes his own GoodFellas turn freaky style with laughoutloud consequences. From the younger actors Jennifer LoveHewitt is less capable her constant bitchy act getting somewhat annoying. Her love interest played by Chasing Amy's Jason Lee is more likable utterly adorable in his naivety and dedication some would say stupidity to his wretched girlfriend who originally only pretends to be interested in him for his money but ends up falling for him.I'd like to think that Heartbreakers had set out to be more than a generic comedy and to be a film with a few lessons to teach about love. However in its 2 hours it ends up using the standard template. Girls tricks boy girl falls in love with boy girl regrets mistake etc. For that the film seems pretty average. There are severe plot holes and thinly sketched characters too plus the fact that the women's aspirations can fall from billions to millions in the space of seconds  it just doesn't make sense. There are additional problems that blaze out so obviously that they are impossible to ignore. But for the most part this is a superior romantic comedy with some excellent moments. A key one is when Weaver keen to prove that she is ahem Russian does her rendition of The Beatles' Back in U.S.S.R. There are some snappy oneliners amusing physical comedy Gene Hackman dying never seemed so funny. The direction is nothing special but the stars raise their mediocre material and aim for comedy heaven often reaching it in a deeply entertaining sometimes sweet movie.".

He is wasting his time always playing a bad guy or thug. He should really be concentrating on comedy. For me he stole the movie. Maybe because I wasn't expecting him to be so spot on with his timing and his facial expressions.Sometimes the music in a movie misses the mark but this time it really enhanced a scene. I highly recommend it. It was such a pleasure to watch a movie that didn't have gratuitous sex or nudity or over the top foul language.

The script has its definite funny moments and I was never bored with what was happening I never checked to see if the film was getting close to being over. What these women do is one of them will start seeing a very wealthy man eventually marry him and then the other will seduce the man hours or a day after the other woman walks in on it then divorces him and they get a huge load of money to play around with. I thought it was a pretty well thought out good premise. The movie has some real romance mixed in not just conning and pretending. What real romance did happen was natural seeming and the chemistry worked. Overall this is a pretty funny film that I think just about anyone would enjoy and it's got an A list cast that does a great job with the well put together writing. 810 for Heartbreakers.".

	schema:reviewBody "First before I get into the review itself let's get this out of the way. For all those guys who debated seeing this movie because it looks like a chick film but you really like Jennifer Love Hewitt.....GO SEE IT! Trust me she is hot in this film. Not just hot but smoking hot. I mean hot enough for you to cry in pain at how unfair life is hot. So hot she might as well have wore a nun costume in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer because she was never as hot as this. There is no excuse for you not to see this as well as BUY it Not rent on DVD or VHS when it comes out. Oh and if you like Sigourney Weaver the same goes for you. But I can only speak for Love fans.As far as the film I liked it. I thought the comedic chemistry between the characters was on target and while it wasn't roll on the floor funny there were some pretty amusing bits. A lot of risque humor of course and I was surprised this got a PG13 rating. You might want to keep the kids home for this one. The Gene Hackman character was funny especially regarding his obsession to smoking. I thought Weaver and Hewitt had good byplay as a motherdaughter who just tolerate one another. The plot is easy to figure out as to where it's going but it's funny along the way and that's what matters. And Jason Lee was really good as the average guy who has to put up with the coniving ways of the Hewitt character. Overall a good way to spend a couple hours at the movies.By the way.......did I say how hot Jennifer Love Hewitt was?.......".

	onyx:emotionText "First before I get into the review itself let's get this out of the way. For all those guys who debated seeing this movie because it looks like a chick film but you really like Jennifer Love Hewitt.....GO SEE IT! Trust me she is hot in this film. Not just hot but smoking hot. I mean hot enough for you to cry in pain at how unfair life is hot. So hot she might as well have wore a nun costume in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer because she was never as hot as this. There is no excuse for you not to see this as well as BUY it Not rent on DVD or VHS when it comes out. Oh and if you like Sigourney Weaver the same goes for you. But I can only speak for Love fans.As far as the film I liked it. I thought the comedic chemistry between the characters was on target and while it wasn't roll on the floor funny there were some pretty amusing bits. A lot of risque humor of course and I was surprised this got a PG13 rating. You might want to keep the kids home for this one. The Gene Hackman character was funny especially regarding his obsession to smoking. I thought Weaver and Hewitt had good byplay as a motherdaughter who just tolerate one another. The plot is easy to figure out as to where it's going but it's funny along the way and that's what matters. And Jason Lee was really good as the average guy who has to put up with the coniving ways of the Hewitt character. Overall a good way to spend a couple hours at the movies.By the way.......did I say how hot Jennifer Love Hewitt was?.......";

A scantily clad Jennifer Love Hewitt is a bit irritating as a vampish daughter who can't make up her mind whether to pursue Jason Lee or not. Lee seems willing to take whatever he can get from her regardless of her abusive treatment.Much of it is very amusing if you can accept the fact that none of the characters are exactly likeable. Gene Hackman has a comic field day as a man with a hacking cough dingy teeth and deathly pallor who finds himself being pursued by Sigourney Weaver who is after his wealthwhat else? One of the funniest scenes has Weaver with thick Russian accent having to get up and perform with a balalaika band at a night spot.Moves at a brisk pace with some funny pratfalls and plot twists that will keep you watching until the predictable fadeout.

This isn't bragging after all imagine what I could have done with this timejust a fact that I have seen and reviewed a huge number of films. And in the course of looking through IMDb I have often noticed reviewers who compare films to those of Hitchcockoften calling them 'Hitchcockian'. Well I HATE when people do this. I am not even sure if Hitchcock himself was always Hitchcockianwhatever that means! And often I have seen this term used for various films of Claude Chabrol. While a few are vaguely like SOME of Hitchcock's these comparisons are useless. I think Chabrol's films are much more 'Chabrolian'! This is not an insultChabrol did some very nice films. But the fact is Leda is very very little like any of the films of Hitchcockmostly because there really isn't a whole lot of suspense and some of the characters especially that of JeanPaul Belmondo are NOTHING like any you'd see in a Hitchcock film...nothing. So please do NOT keep calling films 'Hitchcockian'let them succeed or fail on their own merits! The film is a very sexually charged filmespecially for 1959. It seems that most of the characters either embrace their sexuality or deny itand this seems to be the main underlying theme in this film. It seems that if you embrace it you seek happiness and if you deny it you are choosing misery. This sexuality and the occasionally bizarre nonconformity of SOME of the characters make this seem like an early example of the French New Wave movement. In fact Belmodo's character seems exceptionally similar to the seminal New Wave film Breathlessbut two other New Wave film makers Godard and Truffaut. This observation is not meant to be a criticism or recommendationjust a statement that this film is a clear break with the earlier styles of film makingsomething the New Wave clearly was attempting to do.The husband and wife in the tale are trapped in a loveless marriage. He somewhat openly has an affair with a younger prettier and less emotionally constricted neighbor and the wife refuses to grant him a divorce. His daughter has an onagainoffagain relationship with an obnoxious and carefree goofball Belmondo and it seems like the lady is torn between the lifestyles of her parents. The brother is a cyphera weird guy indeed. As for the wife you really can't tell if she's a horrible person or a victim throughout the filmand that is okay. However when the mistress is murdered brutally the story heats upjust a tiny bit. In fact this is a problem with the film. While the characters are reasonably interesting WHO committed the murder isn't much of a mysteryas the script only really gives two reasonable choices for this. And sadly the most obvious is the killerand the ending just seemed indulgent and loudand not particularly satisfying. There is no Hitchcockian twist or Chabrolian for that matter to make this anything other than a very ordinary film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Marcoux family  husband wife daughter son  live at their vineyard in Provence. Henri Marcoux 45 is weak with a lovely young redheaded mistress who lives next door. Therese Marcoux is possessive sly and goes to Mass quite often. She tells her husband she'll turn a blind eye to the mistress as long as there's no scandal and he throws out the lout who has become their daughter's boy friend. They are not a loving pair. Listen to me Henri she tells him accept my offer or it's goodbye to the redhead. I swear on the heads of my children I'm not joking. Either Laszlo leaves tonight or you never see your redhead again! Who do you think you're talking to? he screams at her. I'm your wife Henri! You're nothing to me he says with his face just inches from hers. You make me want to vomit. You're hateful ugly stupid uncultured hypocritical mean...old! So old! We shouldn't forget that their daughter is vapid. Their son is unpleasantly odd. He favors Mozart and Berlioz and conducts the music himself. He sometimes speculates about the maid and about his sister. The young maid enjoys leaning out her upstairs window in only her bra to tease the gardener and welcome her boy friend who delivers the milk each morning. And Laszlo JeanPaul Belmondo is usually around loud and coarse. When he eats a softboiled egg he leaves more yolk on his face than there is on the plate. He's the kind of jocular sardonic drunk you don't want to sit next to at a bar. When a murder occurs the only question is which one of the above will have been on the receiving end and which one did he deed. They're all reasonable suspects for either role...which for me is the problem with this movie. This was Claude Chabrol's third film and his first in color. He plops the characters down for us to observe but often assumes that we're adult enough to figure out for ourselves such idle things as specific motivation. That all the characters lack either warmth or in some cases much intelligence adds a layer of distance to this film. On the one hand the setup works nicely. For the first thirty minutes Chabrol gives us little vignettes of the family members and their relationships. These vignettes are so amusingly unpleasant I was hoping a solid sly black comedy might emerge. But then the story started. There's little dynamic in a middleaged weak man going ga ga over I mean falling in love with a lovely compliant and wellbuilt red head. The aggressive unpleasantness that sums up Belmondo's character which Chabrol ultimately uses as a device for truth telling left me cold. Belmondo at 26 brings the energy this movie generally lacks but Laszlo is a pain in the neck. It doesn't help that at certain angles the young Belmondo resembles the young George Hamilton. And perhaps it was because this was Chabrol's first color film but he seems at times to have fallen in love with color as a way to underline romance. In the middle of the movie there is a long romantic walk through the greendappled woods by our lovers. They come across some poppies sink to the ground and start some serious fumbling with their clothes. Then the camera slowly pans up to a vast field of orange poppies then to a blue blue sky...with the music soaring. This is Chabrol? The conclusion is arrived at only after a long narrative flashback that leads up to our witnessing the murder. Homicide shouldn't be bland but this one was. If you're fond of Chabrol as I am you'll want to see this as an example of Chabrol still learning to bicycle with the training wheels on. It's testimony to his talent and craftsmanship that they didn't stay on for long. The movie was based on a novel by that great American short story writer Stanley Ellin. He was one of the masters of the form but because he wrote mystery short stories he never rated the sort of literary awe given to writers like the two Johns Cheever and Updike. To find out just how good a short story writer Ellin was buy a copy of The Specialty of the House and Other Stories The Complete Mystery Tales 19481978. You might grow weary of suburbanite angst but I'm willing to bet you'll treasure Ellin.".

	schema:headline " A schizophrenic move in direction of mature Chabrol.possible spoiler in final paragraph";
	schema:reviewBody "Ah this is more like it the truly Chabrolian world taking shape liberated into the constraints of genre.  As if to signal the shift from the new wave naturalism of his earlier works to the glorious artifice of what would become his mature midperiod he offers us two films two worlds one giving on to the other appropriately divided by a murder figuring the death of one style and the birth of another.  The film opens with almost parody New Waveness a loud gaudy riot of blaring American jazz broad character comedy and largerthanlife performances.  The film begins with a nearly naked housemaid lounging from her window in a huge country house like a heroine locked in a fairytale tower driving to erotic madness an aging gardener and a camp milkman the gardener with his shears signalling his lascivious intent matched by the rose she rubs over mouth squalls of jazz adding to comic overheatedness  it's like some sort of Gallic 'Carry On' movie especially as the straitlaced mistress looks on with prudish distaste. Then we're introduced to JeanPaul Belmondo still milling around Paris in fast cars and jump cuts an escapee from his fate in 'A Bout De Souffle' his character's name Laszlo Kovacs is one of Michel's pseudonyms in that film although Chabrol's true intent is revealed when he follows the Godardian frenzy with a cool long shot which imprisons Laszlo down a snakelike alley hemmed in by a street houses roofs Chabrol's ironic camera.  Laszlo IS a snake the city boy who infects the rural Eden by bringing transgressive lust into the bourgeois family as well as the baser attitudes food and sex outrageously linked airbrushed by the middleclasses an early flipside to Terrence Stamp in 'Theorem'. The film continues in this hyperactive vein with Laszlo and his drunken buddy clowning about at a parade to the astonishment of the reallife bystanders who stare uncomprehendingly at Chabrol's camera.  But even here there is another Chabrol waiting to get out as he sets in motion the countryhouse murder plot the family tension the psychosexual power games the incestuousOedipal frisson.  It's remarkable how he takes a genuine 'real' location e.g. the cafe where Laszlo and his buddy drink and turns it into a set for an MGM musical.  It is no accident that the first truly Chabrolian film should also be his first in colour  his skill in artifice is given free reign the restricted camerawork already developed in COUSINS bolstered here by the bursts of pure primary colours and the rigid tableaux as he traps his characters in more than a country estate.  The two halves are joined by simultaneous flashbacks that seem to free the film from its oppressive present tense but only cancel each other out the promise of spiritual rebirth through love in one destroyed by madness and death in the other.  The first flashback begins a common motif in Chabrol the transgressive relationship conceived in a setting of nature in woods  this subjective memory of the father's is coloured with Chabrol's irony  the Ozlike poppy fields hinting ominously at danger the move from 'natural' secrecy to a social openness finally sealing the relationship's fate.  The second half is truly magnificent  the murder taking place completely in mirrors mirroring sorry the cruel humiliation of Therese earlier.  The eerily peaceful track over the dead woman's artefacts stopping at the bed that caused all the trouble wiping her out in more ways than one but also reminding us of the real source of all the trouble prefiguring Chabrol's hero's 'Psycho' by a year although Laszlo's tacit Oedipal tension with his surrogate father adds a Chabrolian twist.

	onyx:emotionText "Ah this is more like it the truly Chabrolian world taking shape liberated into the constraints of genre.  As if to signal the shift from the new wave naturalism of his earlier works to the glorious artifice of what would become his mature midperiod he offers us two films two worlds one giving on to the other appropriately divided by a murder figuring the death of one style and the birth of another.  The film opens with almost parody New Waveness a loud gaudy riot of blaring American jazz broad character comedy and largerthanlife performances.  The film begins with a nearly naked housemaid lounging from her window in a huge country house like a heroine locked in a fairytale tower driving to erotic madness an aging gardener and a camp milkman the gardener with his shears signalling his lascivious intent matched by the rose she rubs over mouth squalls of jazz adding to comic overheatedness  it's like some sort of Gallic 'Carry On' movie especially as the straitlaced mistress looks on with prudish distaste. Then we're introduced to JeanPaul Belmondo still milling around Paris in fast cars and jump cuts an escapee from his fate in 'A Bout De Souffle' his character's name Laszlo Kovacs is one of Michel's pseudonyms in that film although Chabrol's true intent is revealed when he follows the Godardian frenzy with a cool long shot which imprisons Laszlo down a snakelike alley hemmed in by a street houses roofs Chabrol's ironic camera.  Laszlo IS a snake the city boy who infects the rural Eden by bringing transgressive lust into the bourgeois family as well as the baser attitudes food and sex outrageously linked airbrushed by the middleclasses an early flipside to Terrence Stamp in 'Theorem'. The film continues in this hyperactive vein with Laszlo and his drunken buddy clowning about at a parade to the astonishment of the reallife bystanders who stare uncomprehendingly at Chabrol's camera.  But even here there is another Chabrol waiting to get out as he sets in motion the countryhouse murder plot the family tension the psychosexual power games the incestuousOedipal frisson.  It's remarkable how he takes a genuine 'real' location e.g. the cafe where Laszlo and his buddy drink and turns it into a set for an MGM musical.  It is no accident that the first truly Chabrolian film should also be his first in colour  his skill in artifice is given free reign the restricted camerawork already developed in COUSINS bolstered here by the bursts of pure primary colours and the rigid tableaux as he traps his characters in more than a country estate.  The two halves are joined by simultaneous flashbacks that seem to free the film from its oppressive present tense but only cancel each other out the promise of spiritual rebirth through love in one destroyed by madness and death in the other.  The first flashback begins a common motif in Chabrol the transgressive relationship conceived in a setting of nature in woods  this subjective memory of the father's is coloured with Chabrol's irony  the Ozlike poppy fields hinting ominously at danger the move from 'natural' secrecy to a social openness finally sealing the relationship's fate.  The second half is truly magnificent  the murder taking place completely in mirrors mirroring sorry the cruel humiliation of Therese earlier.  The eerily peaceful track over the dead woman's artefacts stopping at the bed that caused all the trouble wiping her out in more ways than one but also reminding us of the real source of all the trouble prefiguring Chabrol's hero's 'Psycho' by a year although Laszlo's tacit Oedipal tension with his surrogate father adds a Chabrolian twist.  The silent mastery of the interrogation sequence and the closing shots hint at Chabrol pleasures to come pleasures we have to wait eight years and 'Les Biches' to fulfil.";

The movie regularly doubles back on itself and shifts around its temporal pieces a lumpy but largely workable metaphor for the tortured family structure. But the opening scene of Lafont leaning out the window in her bikini taunting the workmen is as overplayed as a drunken peep show and I think that from there on the movie consistently attacks individual scenes too zealously to the detriment of the whole. The last line of dialogue emphasizes Leda s rootlessness and lack of family which as a chosen endnote too clumsily points up the dysfunction and mixed blessing of the group we've been watching. It's an entertaining movie though bursting at the scenes with grace notes and thematic vigour but too wild and impulsive for maximum impact.".

It is rather a failure to establish an essential element in a work of art a point of view. Given equal evidence on both sides of the film's moral conflicts viewers draw no conclusion and thus lack a deep involvement in the work.The same problem affects Chabrol's Le boucher 1970 in which the protagonist is given no motivation for protecting a homicidal maniac who goes on to kill again.

Chabrol used magnificent landscapes an old Villa and a Japanese House photographed by master cinematographer Henri Decae whereas Hitch uses an empty motel coming out of a Erskine Caldwell novel like Tobacco Road..I think that Psycho is one of the weakest movies of Hitchcock except for the superb interpretation of Anthony Perkins as Bates.If Chabrol had employed for instance Michel Bouquet instead of Andr Jocelyn the film would be much more sly and credible.But in 1959 Chabrol had 29 years.

This family consists of a husband and wife who own a pleasant mansion and vineyard and are not short of the comforts of life. However although it's not made totally clear there is a feeling that the property actually belongs to the wife. The husband could be described as the epitome of uncharisma. He is exceptionally unprepossessing dull and badly dressed. This makes it very odd that he evidently has a gorgeous mistress living in a smaller modern house a stone's throw from the major building. After she is murdered we discover that she has no family or friends of her own. There are also two adult children a seriously flatfooted son who comes across as a sexless and retarded music addict with even less personality than his father and a daughter who is sweetlooking but seems to lack confidence and direction. In fact the whole family lacks purpose and direction. Noone seems to be in charge. Who looks after the vineyard ? The wife wants to avoid a scandal. The verbally and occasionally physically abusive husband can't make up his mind to leave this longsuffering wife. There is also a sexy and flirtatious maid who is unusually loosely controlled.Then there is a bodybuilding milkman and a rather goofy gardener.The daughter has an unreliable and interfering boyfriend who appears to be quite welloff although it is not at all clear where he gets his money. He has an impoverished buddy. These two loutishly and drunkenly impact on the family but it is not clear why. Since it soon becomes obvious who is responsible for murdering the mistress there is no tension in the detection. A rather obnoxious policeman tells the wife that she is the prime suspect. Needless to say she didn't do it. The film's only tension lies in the relationships between the protagonists which are certainly tense. The murder seems to be oedipally motivated. This can scarcely be considered a good film but it is interesting. I must watch it again to see if I can get to understand it any better. I didn't get the relevance of its title either.".

Needless to say she didn't do it. The film's only tension lies in the relationships between the protagonists which are certainly tense. The murder seems to be oedipally motivated. This can scarcely be considered a good film but it is interesting. I must watch it again to see if I can get to understand it any better. I didn't get the relevance of its title either.";

MEDUZOT tells a zigzag story in which human frailty and persistent mischance raise a new obstacle every moment as the characters carom about in Tel Aviv losing their sleep their jobs their lovers. The movie is propelled by its characters' Keatonesque dauntlessness as they bumble through one unpredictable absurdity after another sometimes involving a failed attempt at good will and sometimes involving obtuse representatives of the established order such as the uncaring landlord the glittering philanthropist and the moronic avantgarde theater. The humor of exaggeration and absurdity that characterizes Etgar Keret's short stories is evident here though he takes credit only as director.

When the child disappears did the child abandon her or did she abandon the child by yelling?

In the poignant scene Batia says They promised he'd come back. The friend reassures Don't worry he's always around. I think in the end her friend and the child help Batia to heal and finally feel secure about drifting through the great sea of life.In the second story will the bride and groom abandon one another when marriage like their tiny hotel room is uncomfortable and feels confining or will they learn to expand in their appreciation for one another and grow even closer? I disagree with the GOOFS section because of what must have been said in the unseen part of the story where Keren explains on why they must go downstairs. I think he knew full well when the handwriting changed because at that point he handed over the paper as he acknowledges there is more to his new wife than he realized. Together they gaze at the sea contemplating.Lastly Joy watches as parents are abandoned by children and children abandon their parents. All she can think of is crossing the ocean to get back to her little boy.I loved this movie! Maybe I healed a little bit in watching it.".

Everything is tainted by a depressive but amusing tone that gives a pleasant melancholia feeling to the spectator. The fact that the story happens in TelAviv does't seem to affect the lightness of this unpretentious movie that only wants to underline the loneliness every human being faces in his life and give a little touch of hope to this sad fact.EASY  As Agns Jaoui in Le Got des autres Etgar Keret and Shira Geffen don't avoid in Meduzot some very easy and predictable critics especially when it comes to give a satirical look on the artistic world of theater of the city. They also can't avoid some Shortcuts in the portrayal of their characters and especially in the depiction of the angry  but at the end nice and well... just lonely  old lady.

	onyx:emotionText "NICE  As Paul Thomas Anderson with Magnolia Etgar Keret and Shira Geffen chose with Meduzot to focus on a few characters that life randomly carries from one shore to another. Everything is tainted by a depressive but amusing tone that gives a pleasant melancholia feeling to the spectator. The fact that the story happens in TelAviv does't seem to affect the lightness of this unpretentious movie that only wants to underline the loneliness every human being faces in his life and give a little touch of hope to this sad fact.EASY  As Agns Jaoui in Le Got des autres Etgar Keret and Shira Geffen don't avoid in Meduzot some very easy and predictable critics especially when it comes to give a satirical look on the artistic world of theater of the city. They also can't avoid some Shortcuts in the portrayal of their characters and especially in the depiction of the angry  but at the end nice and well... just lonely  old lady. This two elements spoil a little bit the pleasure you can get to the pleasant little scenes the film offer.";

The film had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy.However as the film went on the plot never appeared to takeoff and just rolled on scene by scene. I was unable to understand the connection between the stories. All I could see was the characters occasionally bumping into each other and references to ships in bottles. Without that connection I was just left with a few unremarkable short stories.Am surprised it did so well at Cannes".

It's also pretentiousone of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a shrug of the shoulders.The main protagonist is Batya a woman in her twenties' who works as a waitress at catered weddings. Her parents evidently don't care about her very much and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her Batya feels compelled to take care of her. The little girl doesn't speak and Batya can't give her to social services because it's the weekend and the agency is closed. So she takes her back to her apartment with the leaky roof and when it comes time to work in the evening she has to take the little girl with her. The boss is very unhappy about this and other shortcomings in Batya's work performance.Another main character is Keren who is getting married. At her wedding party where Batya is of course working she breaks her leg climbing out of a ladies' room cubicle whose door won't open and so she and her new husband cannot take the Caribbean vacation they've planned. They end up in a dingy hotel on the seafront without a view. It smells bad there is noise from the traffic and Keren is complaining all the time. Her husband meets a strangely attractive older woman  a writer  who is also staying in the hotel and Keren worries that he has slept with this stranger.The third main character is a Filipino woman named Joy who looks after old people. The old woman she is hired to care for is very crabby and speaks no English only German and Hebrew. Joy speaks English but no Hebrew or German. Joy is mostly concerned with how her son is doing back in the Philippines and wants to buy him a toy boat as he has asked. She finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it. The daughter of the old woman who hired Joy is an actress appearing in some sort of postmodern physical theater adaptation of Hamlet and does not get along with her mother.The way in which these three storieswhich intersect momentarilyresolve themselves is presumably supposed to mean something profound. I didn't get it. There is a fantasy element to Batya's relationship with the little girl and maybe Batya's nonexistent relationship with her parents is somehow inverted in this relationship. When Joy sees the toy boat in the shop window there is a strange effect used where the little sails billow as if blown by the wind and they do this as if they are on the scale of a reallife ship. Keren draws the outline of a bottle around a ship that is on a brochure cover in the hotel room and a narration of the strange woman's poetry mentions a ship in a bottle. But what does all this mean? I thought about it for a while and realized I wasn't going to lose any sleep in the process. If anyone out there has a clear idea of what it's all about maybe they can fill me in.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jellyfish for all its generous spirit and lifeaffirming moments doesn't shy away from the little absurdities that inundates everyday existence. Even in the same frame there is a glow amid the isolation and personal embitterment. An unbearable lightness that cannot help but expose the chalky hands of fate. Those who have ever asked in exhaustion why me? can find a lot to love about this little Israeli import.The film is told through a hyperlink narrative. Though its themes are much more ethereal than those of Traffic 2000 or New Year's Eve 2011. That and the narratives don't so much interlock as they migrate towards and away from each other. We follow the progression of three struggling women adrift in noisy Tel Aviv vexing over life's ennui. While doing so the women cross paths barely glimpsing each other's existential angst.The first women is the young Batya Adler. She's a sullen ineffectual banquet hall waitress struggling to keep her job and an apartment that's slowly falling apart. Meanwhile her divorced working professional parents all but ignore the warning signs of her mounting depression brought about when her boyfriend leaves her. Unexpectedly while trying to relax at the beach a mute child Leidman freckled and wet appears like a vision. She tries to find out to whom the child belongs to to no avail.The second woman of our story is newlywed Keren Knoller whose Caribbean honeymoon has been botched by a faulty bathroom stall. Her ankle now broken she tries to make the best of a worsening situation by following her husband Michael Sandler to an aging sea side hotel in town. It is there that Michael meets an attractive writer Albeck whose femme fatale allure threatens the strength of their new marriage.The third woman is a Filipino caretaker named Joy De LaTorre. Joy tries and repeatedly fails to connect with her employer Harifai whose tersely shouts in Hebrew and German neither of which Joy speaks. She pines to have her son with her vainly communicating with him through short collect calls and promises of gifts and visits.A common motif that permeates all three stories is that of water. Joy is mesmerized by a toy boat she wants to get her son while Keren complains that they're a short walk from the beach yet can't see the sea. She also begins to write a poem wistfully equating her feelings of isolation to that of a ship in a glass. Finally there's Batya whose discovery of the child on the beach unlocks dormant traumas that include her parents arguing as the young Batya drifts out to sea in an inflatable tube. Could the water represent transition and the possibility of renewal? Perhaps yes perhaps not.The magical realism that seeps into the lacquered grooves of this film brings with it occasionally irksome subjectivity that's nearly impossible to decode. This film doesn't hold your hand but rather lets you explore the serendipity of Jellyfish's world through the eyes of three women who are dulled by constant misfortune. Some may find their woes pedestrian and cloying especially considering the film is Israeli and completely ignores political realities. Yet choosing characters that exhibit the incessant hard to describe hum of anxiety and depression gives the film both a timelessness and a universality. In the end there's solace in the arms of others a lesson that those quietly suffering would be wise to heed.While occasionally stodgy Jellyfish doesn't wear out its welcome finding just enough pulp in the stories while reveling in some art house expressions and compositions. The subjectivity of its framework works in its favor to deliver a film that can be read in many ways including being a frank and effective meditation on depression. It does all this without being showy or overly pretentious but instead lingering on the deflation of character expectations before rewarding its audience with small but meaningful victories.".

The main character Batya while she was a child had a deep craving for icecream while on the beach but the icecream man was turned away by her mother.

When the mysterious poetess who has given up her suite to the honeymooners commits suicide the groom Michael finds a dead jellyfish under his feet on the beach. The jellyfish imagery is aquatic as the poetess refers to a ship in the bottle sealed up and not feeling any wind and thus stagnant. The Filipino domestic helper Joy wants to buy a large ship model for her son back home. When for the second time she gazes at the toy boat in the shop's display window a magical effect appears the little sails are fed by the wind as if a reallife ship is on high seaa little stirring of real life like the icecream man's shirt catching a breeze in the photo? A third time in front of the shop she finds it sold and becomes very much dejected only to find it in her employer Malka's living room meant as a gift to her. So Joy is the only one that succeeds in giving her child something. The parentchild disappointment is not a oneway traffic as Malka's daughter who hires the Filipino helper Joy to take care of her aging mother tries to win some acclaim to her performance in Hamlet and all she gets from her mother is You lied on the floor half of the time and uttering words that are not understandable even to people on stage! At the end of the movie the actress lady stares from the street resentfully through the window as her mother Malka embraces Joy inside the house.".

When for the second time she gazes at the toy boat in the shop's display window a magical effect appears the little sails are fed by the wind as if a reallife ship is on high seaa little stirring of real life like the icecream man's shirt catching a breeze in the photo? A third time in front of the shop she finds it sold and becomes very much dejected only to find it in her employer Malka's living room meant as a gift to her. So Joy is the only one that succeeds in giving her child something. The parentchild disappointment is not a oneway traffic as Malka's daughter who hires the Filipino helper Joy to take care of her aging mother tries to win some acclaim to her performance in Hamlet and all she gets from her mother is You lied on the floor half of the time and uttering words that are not understandable even to people on stage! At the end of the movie the actress lady stares from the street resentfully through the window as her mother Malka embraces Joy inside the house.";

The manner in which the film is presented is a graceful mixture of naturalism and fantasy and the directors know just how to combine the two approaches to maximum effect. The film opens in Tel Aviv at a routine wedding reception where untidy Batya Sarah Adler works as a waitress her life being recently shaken by the dissolution of her relationship. At this noisy and gaudy reception we also notice the bride Keren Noa Knoller who encounters an accident in the washroom that results in a broken leg requiring a cast and preventing her from a planned honeymoon her new husband Michael  Gera Sandler  finds instead a hotel on the noisy boulevard which is less than romantic and Joy Manenita De Latorre a Filipino caregiver for older unwanted women who works to send support to her young son in the Philippines and a young female photographer who captures it all on film. The owner of the catering business fires Batya and the photographer and the two share living space. While musing on the beach Batya finds a strange young mute girl Nicol Leidman wearing a circular floating device and when Batya cannot find the girl's parents she resorts to police help  a turn which only places Batya as custodian of the strange child. Meanwhile Keren and Michael begin their disastrous honeymoon in the noisy hotel discovering that the quiet top floor suite is occupied by a single woman poet whom Michael meets and eventually requests they trade rooms a decision that leads to strange circumstances that affect all three people. And during this time Joy is passed among several older women ending up with a cranky mother of an actress who speaks only Hebrew and German and takes her time growing into the kindness Joy offers her. Small incidents continue to occur incidents that bind these people together in mysterious ways some happy some sad. And while the characters of this tapestry are very realistically drawn there are moments of magical realism that embroider their lives with a glowing sense of fantasy  moments that address the topics of childhood memories core needs death and that universal need to connect to others. This is a delicate work of crocheted art that remains in the mind long after the credits of this gifted cast and production crew complete the film. In Hebrew with English subtitles. Grady Harp".

Towards the end there is really a poem echoing circumstances of unexpected pathos.This Israeli cinematic gem because of its structure is often compared to Crash. Less known Coeure 2006 would have been an equally good comparison as well as a few others. What makes Jellyfish unique however is that it does not go to the length of these other films in weaving a complex tapestry of the component stories. The three stories in Jellyfish are so casually linked that there may very well be no links. This is good. Overcomplicated plots often distract from the essence of the stories obscuring some of their beauty.Nor does Jellyfish pound the emotions of the audience the way many of these other films did. When the people in this film exhibit their emotions they are nonchalantly lowkey. Again this is good. This leaves the audience more room to ponder and reflect both during the film and afterwards.The main story if there is one evolves around a gentle unassuming young women  vicissitudes and flawed relationships in that part of her life to which we are allowed a brief glimpse. This is also the most surreal of the three stories because the interaction with a mysterious little girl who materializes out of the waves at the beach. This triggers shreds and patches that are open to interpretation such as the young woman's reflection of her own childhood. A secondary character in this segment is another young woman a photographer who befriends the protagonist and helps when the mysterious little girl goes missing.The second story on the contrary is solidly real. It evolves around a young Pilipino domestic helper in Tel Aviv with as the key motif her telephone calls usually in a street corner booth to her 5yearold child back home. The other two key characters in this segment are her employers mother and daughter an invalid and strongheaded old women and an actress who is so wrapped up with her theatre career to spend time caring for her mother.The final story starts with an accident during a wedding when the bride's broken ankle wrecks the planned honeymoon cruise. In a crummy local hotel albeit still at a beach that is a most unsatisfactory substitute a mysterious woman enters that part of the young couple's life stirring disturbing undercurrents of emotion. It is from this mysterious woman purportedly a writer that the poetry comes.While I have left out a lot of details and other characters it can be seen just from the much simplified synopsis what a great variety of emotional avenues the directors can tread down. It is to the credit of Shira Geffen and Etgar Keret that they resisted the temptation of going overboard with the material and wisely kept the film to 87 minutes. Going topheavy into any of these emotional avenues would have ruined this film. They have wisely pass up a stormy symphony for a nonchalant tone poem. For that they have been rewarded last year with the Cannes Camera d'Or for best first film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rating  out of My opinion of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade could be deemed slightly biased. It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it's also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same worndown beatup copy and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition for sentimental reasons of course but nothing beats the pristine quality DVD. I think it's fair to say it's this movie that cemented my love of cinema the high regard I hold for great escapism which is sorely lacking from today's cinema movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentlessly awful scripts or MTVstyle direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old but I think I can safely say they don't make them like they used to.The film stars of course Harrison Ford as Indy Jones the archaeologistadventurer who's on yet another quest this time to find his father who'd been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film actingwise above the others in the trilogy by giving Ford a genuine acting equal let me put it this way he's only half a notch below Harrison FordIndy in charisma and appeal if that tells you anything. The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody complete with amazing action and stunt sequences clever humor and nasty but fun surprises.The script by Jeffrey Boam takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark but actually improves upon that story by paying more attention to characterization. The delightful opening scene all three movies really open with a bang don't they? which details how young Indy got his scar whip hat and fear of snakes makes for a better prequel than Temple of Doom and any of The Adventure of Young Indiana Jones for that matter.The story is engrossing because there's a lot of fun clues offered towards the location of the Grail and thus there's a lot of engaging little discoveries love the X marks the spot scene. I'm quite certain like with Raiders of the Lost Ark the plot has a few holes but they're fairly hard to notice and I've seen this movie quite a few times but maybe it's just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up. Either way it speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg's direction and the performances.Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific and matched well with John Williams' rousing memorable score also the best of the trilogy the best being a fantastic tenminute chase sequence on board and in a tank possibly the best action sequence of Spielberg's career. I also loved the motorcycle chase and the Zeppelin setpiece where the heroes go about dispatching of two enemy fighters in unexpected but quite hilarious fashion. The climax complete with frightening booby traps is a suspenseful venture into the unknown.The Last Crusade is far more humororiented than its predecessors but part of the movie's effectiveness is that it's able to deliver belly laughs without defusing the tension during the action sequences. Some of the jokes are just brilliant including one with Indy armed with a Luger in confrontation with a trio of Nazis on board a tank that's even funnier than the swordsman scene in Raiders well to me at least.The supporting cast is allaround superb John RhysDavies is back as Sallah wonderful as ever and displaying a bit more enthusiasm searching for the Grail than he did digging up the Ark of the Covenant. The late Denholm Elliot also returns as Marcus Brody the most lovable goof of a museum curator. Alison Doody is interesting as Elsa the blonde historian whom Indy falls for a twist involving her character and her actions towards the climax make her not as onedimensional as she may initially appear. Julian Glover is the best of the main Indy villains he's far more menacing than Paul Freeman's Belloq and less overthetop but equally enjoyable as Amrish Pruri's Mola Ram. I also enjoyed Michael Byrne's performance as the Jones hating Colonel Vogel who relishes in torturing Indy and his father. When it comes to pure delightfully nasty villainy Byrne is even more fun to watch than Glover.Harrison Ford delivers his best Indy performance maybe even his best performance period in this particular adventure. With the addition of Connery as his father it reveals a personal side to Indy we haven't seen before. It's his rapport with Connery that separates this film from the rest of the genre. They craft an uncannily touching funny and genuine bond. That coupled with the superb action and thrills solidifies The Last Crusade as the pinnacle of high adventure summer entertainment.".

Now I loved Raiders of the Lost Ark I also really loved Temple of Doom even though it gets a lot of hate for it's darkness. But The Last Crusade is my favorite of the trilogy and the strongest in my opinion. For goodness's sake we have Sean Connery as Indiana's father how could we get any better than that? I love his way of saying Junior! always gets me in a good chuckle. Harrison Ford still has that same Indy charm that swoons the ladies the adventure that captivates the guys and takes us on an incredible journey that we'll never forget.In 1938 Indiana finally recovers the Cross and donates it to his friend Marcus Brody's museum. Indiana is later taken to the residence of wealthy businessman Walter Donovan who informs him that his father has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail leaving behind partial directions from an incomplete stone tablet along with his diary containing his life's work on the Grail. Indiana and Marcus travel to Venice to investigate Henry's disappearance meeting up with his colleague Elsa Schneider. Discovering catacombs beneath the library where Henry was last seen Indiana and Elsa find the tomb of Sir Richard a knight of the First Crusade who is buried with a complete version of the tablet. Indiana finds his father only to be betrayed by Elsa who reveals that she and Donovan are working with the Nazis to find the Grail. The Nazis steal the Grail diary and capture Marcus in Iskenderun where he was sent with pages from the diary to seek the protection of Sallah. The Joneses manage to escape the castle and follow the Nazis to Berlin where they recover the diary from Elsa. The Joneses Marcus and Sallah arrive to find that the Nazis are unable to pass through three trials of God. After Indy's father gets shot he doesn't have much of a choice as to pass the trials and choose the correct cup to save his father's life.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is one of my favorite movies of all time it's just a flawless movie that will always be timeless. My future kids will watch these movies they're just a lot of fun. Who said archeology can't be fun? This also has one of the most exciting chase scenes of all time Indiana is trying to rescue his father and a friend from a Nazi tank and he is on a horse a brutal fight ensues and was just so exciting to watch. I've watched this movie since I was a little girl and I still watch it with pleasure today even with my friends we love watching Indiana and his adventures.

	schema:reviewBody "Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade was in my opinion the best movie of the Indiana Jones trilogy. This movie featured the same type of humor we have become accustomed to from Jones as well as another beautiful woman also probably the best Indy girl and lots of great action scenes! This movie starts off with a teenage Indy River Phoenix which gives us a look at an event that molds his life and character as well as his relationship with his father Henry Sean Connery. We also learn he is a Junior and that he hates to be called that.Back as an adult Indy's father is kidnapped and he must set out to find him. His only clues are his father's diary notes which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy where he meets the gorgeous blonde Dr. Elsa Schneider Alison Doody who becomes an integral part of this story.Once again the grown up Indy Harrison Ford does battle with the Nazis. Apparently Adolf Hitler is after the Holy Grail which contains the blood of Christ. So Indiana and his father team up to get there first. Along the way there is a great action scene where Jones fights a few Nazis on board a moving tank.Overall as I mentioned earlier I believe this to be the best Indiana Jones movie of the three. This action movie was good long before movie studios learned to make the great CGI and special effects. It's effects were pretty good anyways but back in 1989 things just did not look as good as they can make them today. Still highly recommended and worth your time. 9.510".

This is a very difficult balance to achieve in any film and that alone makes the film stand out as brilliant. It is more abundant with humor than the previous two films without the characters falling into irritating selfparody. Being a sequel this is a difficult balance to achieve as well.

As it turned out another film would surface in 2008 but casting that aside as many would like to do Last Crusade should and is judged as the trilogy closer it was meant to be. In 1988 Steven Spielberg was deep into bringing Rain Man to fruition all thoughts of Indiana Jones had gone by the wayside with the harshly judged part two Temple Of Doom. In stepped George Lucas to politely remind Spielberg that they had an agreement to make another Indiana Jones picture Spielberg no doubt obliged and humble passed on his Rain Man work to Barry Levinson who promptly bagged himself an Oscar for the film. It can be guessed that Spielberg was probably grouchy around this period but he needn't have worried because The Last Crusade provided a much needed hit for not only himself post Empire Of The Sun but also Lucas Willow and Harrison Ford Frantic. I mention the run up to this picture because it explains a lot on why the film is pretty much a retread of Raiders Of The Lost Ark something that some detractors find unforgivable. Yet Last Crusade is still an immensely enjoyable adventure picture with Spielberg proving that he was still capable of a popcorn bonanza. Using the Raiders formula and moving away from the dark flourishes of Temple Of Doom Last Crusade is actually the simplest film of the three but still it manages courtesy of a sparkling casting decision to become the most entertaining of the original trilogy. Is it better than Raiders? Of course not but it positively rips along with sparky dialogue and an agenda of cliffhanging suspense like the adventure films of yore. In comes Sean Connery as Dr Jones Senior and its the picture's trump card because the magnificent interplay and obvious rapport with Ford cool as a cucumber is there for all to see. It's this what drives the film on thru it's more mundane and picture filler sequences showcasing two top wily professionals with care and consideration to their craft. The casting of Alison Doody as the main female is a poor one and one only has to look at her subsequent career post Crusade to see she wasn't up to the task here. Bonus comes in the form of the River Phoenix prologue Phoenix as the young Indiana paves the way for the jaunty path that Crusade takes whilst simultaneously giving us a nice little back story from which to launch the adventure. Made for 48 million the film went on to gross 474171806 Worldwide now that's a lot of people who evidently were happy with Raiders Of The Lost Ark 2!

	schema:reviewBody "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the third and final instalment in the original Indiana Jones trilogy. Whereas Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark Last Crusade is a true sequel. Apart from an opening scene relating an adventure of the teenage Indy as a Boy Scout in 1912 the action takes place in 1938 two years after Raiders. In this opening scene we learn how the hero got his nickname Indiana is not as I had always assumed his home state but a name borrowed from his pet dog.Whereas Raiders was a great commercial and critical success Temple of Doom received considerable criticism both on account of its dark gloomy atmosphere and its racist treatment of Indian characters. Steven Spielberg therefore was determined to make the third film lighter in tone closer in spirit to Raiders. Once again the villains are the Nazis once again the plot involves the search for a legendary relic with mystical powers in this case the Holy Grail which caused such excitement among King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table and once again much of the action takes place in the Middle East. This must be the only Hollywood film ever to be set ostensibly in the shortlived Republic of Hatay formerly part of French Syria and today part of southern Turkey which enjoyed a brief independence for several months in 19389. Most of the Hatay scenes however were shot in Spain with the ruins of Petra actually in Jordan standing in for the temple in which the Grail is housed.The film also introduces us to Indy's father Henry Jones Sr. The James Bond films were undoubtedly one of the inspirations for this franchise and it was possibly in their homage that Sean Connery was cast as the elder Jones even though he is only twelve years older than Harrison Ford. That speedboat chase along the Venetian canals also seems to be homage to Bond. Like his son Henry senior is an academic archaeologist and has gone missing while seeking the Holy Grail. Indy believes that his father is in danger and sets out to find him a quest that will take him to Venice Germany and ultimately Hatay. The main female character is Henry's colleague Dr. Elsa Schneider a glamorous Austrian blonde whose loyalties are ambiguous.There is more stress on character development here than in other episodes of the franchise with emphasis being placed on the fatherson relationship. The film is not just about the search for the physical Holy Grail. Even in the Arthurian legend the Grail was as much a symbol as a physical object and today the phrase holy grail is used metaphorically for anything which is desirable and much soughtafter. The film is also about Indiana's search for his lost father and their efforts to reestablish a relationship which in the past has often been strained the story's metaphorical Holy Grail. Ford and Connery are both good at bringing out this aspect of the story. There are also good contributions from Denholm Elliott as Indiana's bumbling colleague Marcus Brody and Alison Doody as the treacherous seductively sinister Elsa.After the awful Temple of Doom Last Crusade represents a welcome return to form both for Spielberg and for Ford who seemed ill at ease in the earlier film but here is back to his old ebullient self. The film contains a better balance of suspense and humour than did its predecessor much of the humour being at the expense of the hapless Marcus. There are some excellent action scenes such as the train sequence in the opening scene the escape from the Zeppelin and the tank chase though the desert. Last Crusade is a very enjoyable adventure film in the same tradition as Raiders. 710".

Connery is about as convincing as Ford's father as Jessie Royce Landis was as Cary Grant's mother in North by Northwest.

	schema:reviewBody "Still wondering how this movie INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE 1989 is so revered in the Indiana Jones trilogy. Yeah I'm not counting Crystal Skull but not for the reasons people think. It's just that it's painfully obvious that Skull was probably never meant to be made and that it was supposed to all end in 1989 with this movie. There are actually things I like about Skull but not this copycat of Raiders of the Lost Ark.The movie starts out with a silly childish sequence of a Young Indiana Jones essayed by River Phoenix who looks NOTHING like a younger version of Harrison Ford on an exploring trip with his boy scout troop in 1912 Utah who finds an ancient relic in a cave and is pursued by nefarious villainous types and goes through all these requisite stunts that mimic action sequences we've already seen in the first 2 movies but these scenes EXPLAIN Indy's phobias and adult idiosyncrasies. Indy eventually loses the battle giving up the artifact to the bad guys but is supposed to have learned a valuable lesson about life....YAWN! We also get a glimpse of Indy's Dad. Flashforward to the film's setting 1939 where Professor Jones is teaching at university while horny college girls drool over him like a rock star just like in the original film. Then ANOTHER group of nefarious types approach him about some stone artifact they found in the ocean that is proof of the existence of the Holy Grail so Indy goes on a trek across the globe just like in the original film which encompasses Italy Germany and Israel in search of the Grail. Along for the ride is Indy's Dad Henry Jones played by Sean Connery in blatant stunt casting who was the leader of the original mission to find the Grail. And guess how the end up meeting? See these Nazis are holding Jones Sr. hostage because they are also interested in finding the precious artifact. Does the word Nazi sound familiar? JUST LIKE IN THE ORIGINAL FILM! I'm sensing a trend here. Also there is the required female sidekick. Of course it's never a bad idea to have an attractive lady in a movie but this one is a stereotypical blonde bimbo who is supposed to be some kind of smart DOCTOR. I've seen halfnaked Bond girls who are more convincing as smarties than this chick!Speaking of BOND back to the stunt casting of Connery! This movie shamelessly plays on Ford and Connery's universal appeal by pairing them as son and father because they bear absolutely NO resemblance to each other. I can suspend disbelief in a movie like Highlander because there are so many things that movie has going for it other than just Sean Connery but not in this movie. He is in no way shape or form convincing as Indy's Dad. Ford had way more chemistry with his costars in the previous 2 movies. The humor between the 2 actors is very strained and not funny their dialog composed of endless annoying bickering.The action in this movie is nothing to write home about either. It's amazing but I actually thought much of the effects in this movie looked incredibly cheesy! And this movie came out years AFTER the first 2 movies whose effects to this day look fresh and engaging. Then we have the repetitive battles with Nazis. Now I actually think that Temple of Doom is the best Indy flick but Raiders still is entertaining with many positives and at least the villains in that movie had a panache and mystique about them with talented actors playing them with flair but the villains in this are incredibly stale with no flair.What boggles my mind even more is that there is a healthy amount of fans that actually think THIS awful movie is the BEST of the original trilogy when it is nothing but a sad clone of the Raiders and not nearly as entertaining as Doom! A case where mindless action wins over real filmmaking. Can't win 'em all!".

Along for the ride is Indy's Dad Henry Jones played by Sean Connery in blatant stunt casting who was the leader of the original mission to find the Grail. And guess how the end up meeting? See these Nazis are holding Jones Sr. hostage because they are also interested in finding the precious artifact. Does the word Nazi sound familiar? JUST LIKE IN THE ORIGINAL FILM! I'm sensing a trend here. Also there is the required female sidekick. Of course it's never a bad idea to have an attractive lady in a movie but this one is a stereotypical blonde bimbo who is supposed to be some kind of smart DOCTOR. I've seen halfnaked Bond girls who are more convincing as smarties than this chick!Speaking of BOND back to the stunt casting of Connery! This movie shamelessly plays on Ford and Connery's universal appeal by pairing them as son and father because they bear absolutely NO resemblance to each other. I can suspend disbelief in a movie like Highlander because there are so many things that movie has going for it other than just Sean Connery but not in this movie. He is in no way shape or form convincing as Indy's Dad. Ford had way more chemistry with his costars in the previous 2 movies. The humor between the 2 actors is very strained and not funny their dialog composed of endless annoying bickering.The action in this movie is nothing to write home about either. It's amazing but I actually thought much of the effects in this movie looked incredibly cheesy! And this movie came out years AFTER the first 2 movies whose effects to this day look fresh and engaging. Then we have the repetitive battles with Nazis. Now I actually think that Temple of Doom is the best Indy flick but Raiders still is entertaining with many positives and at least the villains in that movie had a panache and mystique about them with talented actors playing them with flair but the villains in this are incredibly stale with no flair.What boggles my mind even more is that there is a healthy amount of fans that actually think THIS awful movie is the BEST of the original trilogy when it is nothing but a sad clone of the Raiders and not nearly as entertaining as Doom! A case where mindless action wins over real filmmaking. Can't win 'em all!";

We had no idea what the film was about but we wanted to see something fun and spectacular. Well we weren't disappointed. I remember this experience fondly.So when I saw INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE when it was released at the movies I couldn't believe how terrible and pathetic it was from beginning trite flashback to Indy's youth to miserable end sexist death of the sole female character in the whole film.Let's start with the beginning. Then again maybe not. River Phoenix was totally miscast as the young Indiana Jones. He just doesn't look like he's having fun at all. And to have Indy go through a number of incidents that took place at one time that explains Indy's fear of snakes his hat his whip etc was so bleeding obvious and badly conceived that I thought it was a parody. But it's not. It's played straight. After seeing that beginning I knew I was going to suffer much more. And suffer I did.Practically every aspect of what made the first film so fun and memorable was ruined by the terrible screenplay by Jeffrey Boam. The film is just a collection of crude injokes a boatload of silly coincidences badly conceived action scenes most of them echoing and relying on those from the first film a story filled with so many mistakes and gargantuan plotholes sprinkled with forced comedy bits and all wrapped up in a neat package that made Paramount happy. The fact is this was a stinker and they knew it. The series only after three movies had already ran out of steam and it ended after this one. Everything felt forced in LAST CRUSADE. Harrison Ford looked bored. Like Phoenix Sean Connery was miscast as Indy's father. The only reason they hired Connery was to make a link with the Indy series and the James Bond series. Nothing else. Connery added nothing to the series. But the worst aspect of this turkey was its only female character. In the first Indiana Jones Marion was an equal to Indy. She was spunky tough and cute. In LAST CRUSADE Alison Doody plays Elsa an unpleasant blond NAZI bitch who dies a miserable death at the end. Pretty sad when you think about it.The action throughout the movie was as compelling as a Tom  Jerry cartoon. Case in point when Connery scares the birds on the beach and makes them fly directly in front of a plane in order to bring the plane down. Not only is this scene stupid but it's really crass re the birds' welfare. The coincidences were so moronic and such groaners Indy bumping into Hitler that I've never done so much eye rolling during the viewing of of a single film. Had this been the first Indiana Jones film it would have flopped because it relies so much on RAIDERS' coat tails that if you haven't seen the first one it wouldn't make much sense. After the bad experience that was TEMPLE OF DOOM INDIANA JONES  THE LAST CRUSADE was the last straw and my enthusiasm for this series completely evaporated. That was 18 years ago. Now I hear they're doing an Indy 4. They shouldn't bother with it. Put a fork in it. It's done.".

	schema:reviewBody "By the time of this writing Blockbuster Inc. stores probably have all but vanished. Each with a sign that indicates that it's just this store that's closing. Sad but that's how the story goes. Remember the Beta Video stores?When I was a kid and we got our very first VCR  man that was like the invention of television for those around my age  and I was able to save up enough money to buy two previously viewed movies. And get this I had to actually preorder previously viewed VCR tapes and they were incredibly 19.95 apiece!No matter I really wanted both Lethal Weapon 2 and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. And bad.They were like gold for me. And they along with a birthday gift of the original Batman certainly earned their weight. I must've watched those three  my only movies  fifty times each.So you can see I am very familiar with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Every inch score number and frame. I love this movie.Later I would contest and readily agree Raiders of the Lost Ark is both a masterpiece and better film but that doesn't deter on howmuchFUN this third installment is. And I'm not even mentioning the dreadful part two Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. In my mind there's only Indy 1 and 3. You can even forget the yawn Young Indiana Jones socalled Adventures.Everything worked in this movie suburb acting hilarious and fun dialogue  mostly from the chemistry or banter of the two Jones's extreme adventure exciting action fantastic characters nostalgia  for fans of Raiders and great twists. And one of the best aspects is also a spoiler  sorry but if you haven't seen this 22yearold epic that's your fault  it has one of the best endings in the history of cinema they actually ride off into the sunset. Brilliant and beautiful ending to the series!  that is until they ruined it with the overkill Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Best advice? Think of this as the actual LAST adventure and forget that wretched sequel.Heck I can't really pinpoint many if any faults or flaws in Last Crusade. Pooossssibly the overlong opening segment with the original Young Indiana played by the late and great River Phoenix? Even that was entertaining fun and had an awesome score track. So technically it's not a setback but perhaps needed a little more editing.Indiana Jones Harrison Ford is overwhelmed at school but is more so when his father Henry Jones Sr. Sean Connery  in Literally one of his best onscreen performances is listed as missing. Indy is tempted with the prospect of finding the mystical Holy Grail even though he himself doesn't believe it. He does set off on a mission to find his father but we all know he'd equally like to find this Lost Cup of Jesus Christ.He meets up with what I grew up referring to as the blonde the beautiful and seductive dame Dr. Elsa Schneider Alison Doody and they quest to find daddy Jones and ward off Nazis. Not so much a spoiler but he does rescue Henry Jones Sr. and the race for the Grail is on between the Jones's and the Nazis.I left out a lot but that's the basic BASIC premise. Seriously if you have not seen this or have even see it again if you have and learn to enjoy the film that frankly defines adventure. And a movie that captures the heart of the original the atmosphere of the serials of before most of our times and how movies were really made preCGI.On a related note while some people are anti3D I am boarderline antiCGI. Sure it's a cheaper way of filmmaking but I feel it's just that cheap. Rarely will it be believable in my sight for the most part it's allbut a cartoon and extremely laughable. That said it can worksometimes. The recent 2010 Alice in Wonderland film is a perfect example of how it can really work and impress me. But 80 of the time it's just plain corny distracting and again CHEAP. My favorite actionadventures films are how they used to be made with both inventiveness and heart. Like this one. Heck I'll take a bluegreen screen any day over a computer telling me what's real looking.But I digress. I hesitate in calling this a masterpiece in filmmaking at least but in my mind it is. And seeing that this is an opinion piece I will go on record it doesn't get much better than this.I remember some of the promotional shots on the late night shows from Harrison Ford et al that casually admitted Temple of Doom was a disaster  I AGREE  and this was a makeup movie.

Support and watch movies like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Remember what it was like to have fun in the theatre what it was like when real specialeffect crews did real work on the fields and not in the office and remember what it was like to be a kid again.

	onyx:emotionText "By the time of this writing Blockbuster Inc. stores probably have all but vanished. Each with a sign that indicates that it's just this store that's closing. Sad but that's how the story goes. Remember the Beta Video stores?When I was a kid and we got our very first VCR  man that was like the invention of television for those around my age  and I was able to save up enough money to buy two previously viewed movies. And get this I had to actually preorder previously viewed VCR tapes and they were incredibly 19.95 apiece!No matter I really wanted both Lethal Weapon 2 and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. And bad.They were like gold for me. And they along with a birthday gift of the original Batman certainly earned their weight. I must've watched those three  my only movies  fifty times each.So you can see I am very familiar with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Every inch score number and frame. I love this movie.Later I would contest and readily agree Raiders of the Lost Ark is both a masterpiece and better film but that doesn't deter on howmuchFUN this third installment is. And I'm not even mentioning the dreadful part two Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. In my mind there's only Indy 1 and 3. You can even forget the yawn Young Indiana Jones socalled Adventures.Everything worked in this movie suburb acting hilarious and fun dialogue  mostly from the chemistry or banter of the two Jones's extreme adventure exciting action fantastic characters nostalgia  for fans of Raiders and great twists. And one of the best aspects is also a spoiler  sorry but if you haven't seen this 22yearold epic that's your fault  it has one of the best endings in the history of cinema they actually ride off into the sunset. Brilliant and beautiful ending to the series!  that is until they ruined it with the overkill Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Best advice? Think of this as the actual LAST adventure and forget that wretched sequel.Heck I can't really pinpoint many if any faults or flaws in Last Crusade. Pooossssibly the overlong opening segment with the original Young Indiana played by the late and great River Phoenix? Even that was entertaining fun and had an awesome score track. So technically it's not a setback but perhaps needed a little more editing.Indiana Jones Harrison Ford is overwhelmed at school but is more so when his father Henry Jones Sr. Sean Connery  in Literally one of his best onscreen performances is listed as missing. Indy is tempted with the prospect of finding the mystical Holy Grail even though he himself doesn't believe it. He does set off on a mission to find his father but we all know he'd equally like to find this Lost Cup of Jesus Christ.He meets up with what I grew up referring to as the blonde the beautiful and seductive dame Dr. Elsa Schneider Alison Doody and they quest to find daddy Jones and ward off Nazis. Not so much a spoiler but he does rescue Henry Jones Sr. and the race for the Grail is on between the Jones's and the Nazis.I left out a lot but that's the basic BASIC premise. Seriously if you have not seen this or have even see it again if you have and learn to enjoy the film that frankly defines adventure. And a movie that captures the heart of the original the atmosphere of the serials of before most of our times and how movies were really made preCGI.On a related note while some people are anti3D I am boarderline antiCGI. Sure it's a cheaper way of filmmaking but I feel it's just that cheap. Rarely will it be believable in my sight for the most part it's allbut a cartoon and extremely laughable. That said it can worksometimes. The recent 2010 Alice in Wonderland film is a perfect example of how it can really work and impress me. But 80 of the time it's just plain corny distracting and again CHEAP. My favorite actionadventures films are how they used to be made with both inventiveness and heart. Like this one. Heck I'll take a bluegreen screen any day over a computer telling me what's real looking.But I digress. I hesitate in calling this a masterpiece in filmmaking at least but in my mind it is. And seeing that this is an opinion piece I will go on record it doesn't get much better than this.I remember some of the promotional shots on the late night shows from Harrison Ford et al that casually admitted Temple of Doom was a disaster  I AGREE  and this was a makeup movie. It sure the heck was! This was thee number one redemption movie of all time.Note to Hollywood continue the redemption. Make movies like this verses the CGIlaced noscript films of the last decade or so. Remember what it's like to have this much fun in the movie going experience. I remember. I recall 1989 when this was released as my alltime favorite year in films released. Too bad they haven't come close to '89 in 22 years.And Hollywood won't listen. I ask that you do.

I was looking forward to 'The Last Crusade' and now its pretty evident how much I loved it 'The Last Crusade' joins the adventure of Indiana Jones once more who is on a rescue mission to rescue his father Henry Jones who went missing on his search for the Holy Grail. This film is purely brilliant in every way possible. The story is the best of three. The characters in this movie are much better than they are in the first two even though I like the villain in the second one more than I did in the first one and this one. The musical score by John Williams in this movie is to me the best its ever been and feels even more magical than the first two. The characters and story are engaging the movie is directed and written almost perfectly and overall the movie is very comedic in its tone but also serious with two such opposing tones mixing together perfectly! There are so many amazing sequences that clearly demonstrate just how amazing the art of film making was back in the glory days. There are so many scenes that are filmed amazingly the visual effects looking great and the action sequences looking better than most CGI crap today. The film is well aware to not be over the top but is instead a perfect blend of just the right amount of everything necessary to make a movie great.There are however a few goofy scenes with Henry Jones but this is so easily forgotten as everything else in the movie is beyond the credibility of film making.In conclusion I can easily draw the review down to this and say that this movie is an absolute must see but is always best to watch the first two and come into this. Every aspect of film making is easily surpassed in this masterpiece. Must see A In my Top 10 all time favorite movies!".

Every now and then he makes a winner but most are forgettable Bmovies that he agrees to do for a paycheck You can't blame the man for doing his job. However not all Bmovies are bad  in fact they're ideal entertainment if you want to sit back relax and shut off your brain for a couple hours. Trespass provides that mindless entertainment in spades with a few headscratches along the way.The premise of Trespass is simple Nic Cage plays a diamond dealer who lives in a beautiful house with his wife and daughter and some thugs break into the house one day to steal his stash. Nicole Kidman plays his wife who feels distant from her hardworking husband and the daughter is a typical rebellious teen that sneaks out and goes to a party behind her parents' back. Nothing special. What makes this movie interesting is the performances. Cage taps into his subtlety  something he rarely does these days  which helps the tension and uneasiness of the atmosphere build until he finally bursts on more than one occasion. And you never really know what is going through his head. These characters have secrets all of them and herein lies most of the film's faults.The villains in this movie are a mixed bag. Each of the burglars have their own agenda that we find out over the course of the movie through the use of flashbacks and security cam footage. Some of the reveals are a pleasant surprise others leave you scratching your head. It gets to the point that they're trying to intertwine all these villains' motives together but it ends up feeling forced and underwhelming. However it is nice that they tried to do something different. Also Ben Mendelsohn's performance as the lead maniac and his eccentric backandforth between Cage really adds to the gravity of the situation and makes for a gripping protagonistantagonist dynamic.So to wrap up this is not a thinking man's movie. You can try to put all the pieces together at the end but you'll only end up confused and disappointed  it's not worth the effort. The best thing you can do is grab some popcorn turn off your brain and watch the events unravel before your eyes. You won't remember this movie as one of Cage's best that's for sure but it's far from his worst. A good date movie? Sure. It's only 90 minutes and if you're a fan of Nicolas Cage you'll surely get at least some enjoyment from Trespass.".

As a fan of Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman I was also interested to see just how terrible they were.In actual fact I think the critics have been a little cruel. As other reviewers have commented this is no groundbreaking piece of work it's a home invasion story and highlights the lengths people will go to for money see Panic Room for more details....!. Yes there is a lot of screaming from Nicole and a lot of people saying run and no one runs anywhere but to be fair if I was in their position I would likely be in a corner papping myself with fear.It seems that they follow a similar formula to Panic Room in that the burglars are pretty brutal and one or two of them seem slightly unhinged but this is clearly a device used to work up tension as they become more panicked and more unpredictable. In a sense I liked this element which showed something more of the invaders' humanity their fears and failings.All in all this is not an amazing film but nor is it that terrible. It also isn't half as violent as people make out  there is a fair amount of threat but I have seen a lot worse and I am not a fan of violent movies. So 610 seems a fair score although personally I quite enjoyed it  it was easy enough to watch and I was interested enough to keep watching to the end. But maybe that's just me.".

As other reviewers have commented this is no groundbreaking piece of work it's a home invasion story and highlights the lengths people will go to for money see Panic Room for more details....!. Yes there is a lot of screaming from Nicole and a lot of people saying run and no one runs anywhere but to be fair if I was in their position I would likely be in a corner papping myself with fear.It seems that they follow a similar formula to Panic Room in that the burglars are pretty brutal and one or two of them seem slightly unhinged but this is clearly a device used to work up tension as they become more panicked and more unpredictable. In a sense I liked this element which showed something more of the invaders' humanity their fears and failings.All in all this is not an amazing film but nor is it that terrible. It also isn't half as violent as people make out  there is a fair amount of threat but I have seen a lot worse and I am not a fan of violent movies. So 610 seems a fair score although personally I quite enjoyed it  it was easy enough to watch and I was interested enough to keep watching to the end. But maybe that's just me.";

Nic Cage does a fine job of subduing his performance and avoiding the tics that make him so Nicholas Cagey but at some points it seems like a detriment. Coupled with the home invaders failure to produce much of a 'menacing' feel Nic's performance doesn't do much to stem the movie from it's ultimate failure a lack of intensity. In fairness it seemed like more of a script issue his character didn't seem very realistic.Kidman's hyperventilating hysteria and sobbing pleas almost seem out of place in such a setting and I couldn't help but wish someone would just slap the bajeesus out of her already to quiet her down. She came close to seeming like a clich but then it dawns on you that her acting would be right on target were the scenes and script properly conveying the direness of the situation she was responding to.The bad guys were somewhat typical bad guys and although Ben Mendelsohn stood out with some great acting in some scenes it could do little to conceal the sense that he was just doing his best to negotiate through some awkward dialogue. The movie wasn't bad it was just a bit predictable and boring and watching it plod along I kept waiting for it to be over so I could do something else. It's not transfixing so would make for a great background movie while you do crosswords or something.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was curious to watch Trespass because of the interesting casting of Nic Cage and Nic Kidman. I was a bit wary about Nic Cage as his films lately have been a bit on the hammy side. Despite his leery reputation though it is a wonder that he continues to get a lot of work but good for him. Another curiosity about this film was the name of Joel Schumacher as director. His was a big name in directing boxoffice hits in the 80s and 90s. The last of film of his I had seen was when he directed Gerard Butler as Phantom of the Opera. Trespass turned out to be a film about a family whose beautiful suburban house was intruded upon by a gang of desperate amateur robbers. The robbers were quite violent and brutal the way they treated diamond trader Kyle Miller Nic Cage his glamorous wife Sarah Nic Kidman and their rebellious young daughter Avery Liana Liberato. Things got a little more complicated when it was revealed that one of the robbers Jonah Cam Gigandet had a psychotic crush on Sarah.The performances were over the top and unconvincing both of the victims and the intruders. Nicole Kidman reminded me of her debut performance in Dead Calm as the victim of a psycho guy in love with her. However she definitely loses her subtlety as well as any sexual tension as a victim here. Nicolas Cage was typically florid in his acting. You don't know where from his business background he got his extreme gungho bravado in facing these robbers! It was good to see Liana Liberato again after her memorably disturbing debut film Trust. She had her good moments here. Cam Gigandet was appropriately creepy as the deluded Romeo. Jonah's brother and gang ringleader Elias was wellplayed by Ben Mendelsohn whom I just realized was one of the sons in another crime family in Animal Kingdom. This was probably one of the noisiest movies set in a single house that I have seen. Everyone was always hysterically screaming and shouting at the top of their lungs. Despite the brutality of the robbers it was a wonder how the victims also had the guts to stand up to them. The Millers were daringly answering and fighting back in spite of the guns brandished by the bad men in their faces! I must say this whole thing was highly improbable and unrealistic. Watch this at your own risk. Strictly for fans of the two Nics.".

The robbers were quite violent and brutal the way they treated diamond trader Kyle Miller Nic Cage his glamorous wife Sarah Nic Kidman and their rebellious young daughter Avery Liana Liberato. Things got a little more complicated when it was revealed that one of the robbers Jonah Cam Gigandet had a psychotic crush on Sarah.The performances were over the top and unconvincing both of the victims and the intruders. Nicole Kidman reminded me of her debut performance in Dead Calm as the victim of a psycho guy in love with her. However she definitely loses her subtlety as well as any sexual tension as a victim here. Nicolas Cage was typically florid in his acting. You don't know where from his business background he got his extreme gungho bravado in facing these robbers! It was good to see Liana Liberato again after her memorably disturbing debut film Trust. She had her good moments here. Cam Gigandet was appropriately creepy as the deluded Romeo. Jonah's brother and gang ringleader Elias was wellplayed by Ben Mendelsohn whom I just realized was one of the sons in another crime family in Animal Kingdom. This was probably one of the noisiest movies set in a single house that I have seen. Everyone was always hysterically screaming and shouting at the top of their lungs. Despite the brutality of the robbers it was a wonder how the victims also had the guts to stand up to them. The Millers were daringly answering and fighting back in spite of the guns brandished by the bad men in their faces! I must say this whole thing was highly improbable and unrealistic. Watch this at your own risk. Strictly for fans of the two Nics.";

	schema:reviewBody "This straight to DVD paint by numbers thriller staring Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman was one hell of a disappointment. The home invasion subgenre while popular continually devours itself by its own lack of originality. There were a few moments in Trespass where the story could have taken a much more substantial route but rather then strive for something original the story falls back into the safe paint by numbers genre style. So in short  once you've seen one you've seen them all.I have no idea where it went wrong but there was once a time when Nicolas Cage was hailed as being a great talent of cinema. During the past 10 years I can only count two films that feature the quality of acting he was once known for  2009's doomsday epic Knowing  2011's fantastic Drive Angry. There were scenes in Trespass that were obviously meant to be tense  on the edge but they were stripped of that feeling by the subpar performance of Nicolas Cage as Kyle Miller. I found myself laughing several times when I should have been rooting for his character. He was just that bad. Played by someone else the character of Kyle Miller could have helped anchor this movie a little more and allow it to regain the intensity that it lacked.The supporting cast Nicole Kidman included worked with what they had but I just wasn't able to invest in caring whether they lived or died. Nicole Kidman who is still such a great talent was reduced to spending the majority of this film sobbing and crawling along the ground. There was no need for the character of Sarah Miller Nicole Kidman to be played by someone of Kidmans stature. This character could have been played by anyone. The character Avery Miller Liana Liberato has a couple of great scenes towards the end of this film.Trespass had the chance to go down a different route but sadly it went the safe predictable path that we've all seen before.".

The plot is wild for the purpose of entertainment but weak in terms of storyline.

Unbeknown to the alarm installers brother a drug muledealer! the alarm installer robs him of some drugs in a hold up causing his brother to now be indebted to some gangland boss who requires monies to be paid in lieu of the losses. The alarm installer suggests the Cage's household as a place that could be robbed to recover the monies just so that the installer could declare his love for Kidman and convince her to come along with him. Cage has no money in a safe he's buried it in a wall. A really stupid and crazy storyline ensues until we discover nothing in the safe and a fight later reveals hordes of money stashed in a false wall. All the robbers end up shooting each other with the crazy delusional alarm installer shooting his own brother trying to collect the money and trying his luck with kidman. Before cage get up and shoots the installer with a nail gun he decides to use a lighter to set fire to what must be millions of dollars.The entire film is a farce. It was a failure at the box office. It's simple entertainment at the most basic level with a lot going on  but it's not got any substance. This is a really stupid film and it's no wonder it's a failure. They pulled it from the cinema early because it was such a flop! Save your time people because you'll have more satisfaction swatting flies then you'll ever get from this film. 210.".

The marriage of the characters Kyle and Sarah Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman respectively seems strained at first with Sarah's needs not being met because of Kyle's being preoccupied with work. When 2 police officers come to the house however terror ensues. A violent hostage situation grips the family and shows how far a father will go for his wife and his daughter. Not only does Nicolas Cage shine as a man with a tortured secret he embodies how strong a person should be in such a situation. The shocking realism of this movie is bloody but not too gory and really thrills you to the last scene.

But Trespass is so unrealistic and outrageous that at times it becomes absurd and outrageously melodramatic. It tries to sweep away with one grand stroke all of the logical flaws in the script by simply claiming that the burglars are psychotic and insane. On the whole it insults the intelligence of the viewer by expecting the viewer to believe things would happen like they did in Trespass. In other movies of this genre there are always twists and somewhat unrealistic scenes that one can overlook if there is a cleverness or a presiding intelligence behind the story but Trespass lacks this sharpness and edginess. The outrageousness lack of realism and madness of the story is simply too much to ask the viewer to believe and look past.The movie does have its moments and isn't entirely worth ignoring however. The acting of Nicole Kidman is excellent and to see how she and Nicholas Cage are onscreen together is also very intriguing. The house where it is set has a very interesting modern design that comes off as very stylish and aesthetically appealing. A few of the twists and surprises in the movie are clever and there are a handful of good moments in the movie where I was surprised and satisfied with the cleverness of a certain turn of events.Overall however as I sat and watched the movie it turned into not the fascinating intense and intelligent thriller I hoped it would be but a merely average movie that I couldn't possibly believe that got worse and worse as it climaxed to near complete absurdity. If the movie is worth a view at all it is simply to see the chemistry between Cage and Kidman and to appreciate the architectural design of the house where the movie is set. The ideas in the writing aren't wholly absurd but clearly the writing and ideas aren't the strong point of Trespass.".

A needlessly convoluted and deeply boring situation plays out filled with backstories exposition and head banging tedium. If it wasn't for Nicole Kidman's noble efforts and the occasional burst of tension this could easily be a 0. There's nowhere to hide with this film. This is just a terrible terrible movie in almost every way. Everyone involved should be ashamed except for Kidman. Nicolas Cage a year after his return to form in KickAss goes back into shouty overacting mode and makes a fool of himself yet again as he goes into a performance so predictably maniacal it's not even fun anymore. Meanwhile everyone else is terrible in this and Joel Schumacher's direction is less interesting than a blank sheet of paper.The truth is this isn't really entertainment. It's like being locked in a tight space with someone who hasn't washed for a month yelling and screaming in your face for 4 hours. It's a mean spirited and repetitive film which I'd already half forgotten the next day. I was so bored I was half asleep during the second half. With many clichs and no thrills at all Trespass is lacking in any fun or excitement at all. Thankfully there is justice in the world after all and this bombed at the box office. Rarely has a film deserved to bomb more than this useless lame lifeless garbage. The film does nothing but scream at you for 90 minutes and a result it feels like 190 minutes. A painfully dull film which should only be watched if you're having difficulty sleeping this is so lacklustre and tedious there really isn't a lot more to say that hasn't already been said. In a year full of awful films this undoubtedly one of the worst. Still this is supposed to be a claustrophobic thriller and it's so bad when watching the film it can feel claustrophobic so they manage to let the audience emphasize with the characters.

This movie is set in a mountainous part of the IraqIran border where the local Kurds eke out a living smuggling tea and tractor tyres by mule train from Iran into Iraq. The return cargo seems to be school exercise books  what the mullahs of Iran have got against those I cannot imagine. No doubt they the Iranian Kurds are not on President Bush's Christmas card list but their main customers are likely to be Kurds on the Iraqi side. The main problem though is not the authorities but bandits eager to knock off the smuggler's loads.The hero here is 12 year old Ayoub who has to follow in his father's footsteps after the death of his father on a smuggling trip. As Dad stepped on a landmine this is a dangerous undertaking but Ayoub is determined to earn enough money for a operation to prolong the life if only for a few months of his severely crippled and retarded older brother. This sounds like blatant melodramatic manipulation and it is but it works.Why does it work? There's the cinemaphotography so perfectly lit and composed you might as well be standing there. There is excellent use of handheld cameras especially on the trail sequences. None of the actors is professional and the whole thing has a documentary air. Above all the emotional bonds between the characters ring true. Perhaps when you have next to nothing your family becomes allimportant though the kinship bonds here seen to weaken quickly outside the immediate family circle. Kurdistan is a tough place and people are hard and there's not much community support for the weak and frail. The young are expected to shape up fast or fall by the wayside. As for the horses well animal rights activists would be run out of town. Yet there is a stark beauty about the film that makes it hard to dismiss  the slow pace grows on you. Ayoub may be going to grow up as just another tough ignorant sexist tribesman but we glimpse here he is going to school that he might do better. This is a remarkable and different film and a very good antidote to the recent stream of romantic comedies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Time of Drunken Horses is an uncompromising film about love and perseverance.  It closely resembles the Iranian film Color of Paradise and the Chinese Not One Less in its simplicity and its unrelenting message as well as using skilled child and adult actors in reallife settings. Filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi reminds us up front that we in the West don't understand the plight of the Kurdish refugees numbering 20 million in Iran Iraq Syria and Turkey.  Time of Drunken Horses is both an important lesson as well as a powerful homage to the suffering Kurdish people.  To its credit the film does depict the suffering as sympathy but rather as heroic and noble.  When children have to fight for work in the marketplace usually carrying heavy contraband on their backs or when they have to trudge through deep snow to return to their village or when they sing childhood songs about how they are aging so fast there is a surprising energy and enthusiasm.  The film takes its viewpoint from three children  a teenage boy Ayoub placed in charge of a disintegrating family his younger sister Amaneh and the crippled and sick brother Madi.  The father has died in a landmine accident and the stepmother is away leaving the children in the hands of an already burdened uncle with eight children of his own.  Madi needs an operation to extend his life another 7 or 8 months otherwise he will died soon.  The love extended to this midget child is remarkable from the brother and sisters one even accepts marriage in exchange for obtaining the needed operation to the kindly doctor who comes regularly to give injections.  That is the one irony that this film plainly wants to get across.  We are blest with modern medicine is at our fingertips and yet we can decide to withhold care if it appears to be futile.  How then can we understand in a society in which there is so little the determination of one boy to extend the live of someone he truly loves when the odds are overwhelmingly against him.  The final scene merely strengthens the powerful message of Time of Drunken Horses as the boy and his crippled brother valiantly march off in the snow to a future we know will not be pleasant.".

It closely resembles the Iranian film Color of Paradise and the Chinese Not One Less in its simplicity and its unrelenting message as well as using skilled child and adult actors in reallife settings. Filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi reminds us up front that we in the West don't understand the plight of the Kurdish refugees numbering 20 million in Iran Iraq Syria and Turkey.  Time of Drunken Horses is both an important lesson as well as a powerful homage to the suffering Kurdish people.  To its credit the film does depict the suffering as sympathy but rather as heroic and noble.  When children have to fight for work in the marketplace usually carrying heavy contraband on their backs or when they have to trudge through deep snow to return to their village or when they sing childhood songs about how they are aging so fast there is a surprising energy and enthusiasm.  The film takes its viewpoint from three children  a teenage boy Ayoub placed in charge of a disintegrating family his younger sister Amaneh and the crippled and sick brother Madi.  The father has died in a landmine accident and the stepmother is away leaving the children in the hands of an already burdened uncle with eight children of his own.  Madi needs an operation to extend his life another 7 or 8 months otherwise he will died soon.  The love extended to this midget child is remarkable from the brother and sisters one even accepts marriage in exchange for obtaining the needed operation to the kindly doctor who comes regularly to give injections.  That is the one irony that this film plainly wants to get across.  We are blest with modern medicine is at our fingertips and yet we can decide to withhold care if it appears to be futile.  How then can we understand in a society in which there is so little the determination of one boy to extend the live of someone he truly loves when the odds are overwhelmingly against him.  The final scene merely strengthens the powerful message of Time of Drunken Horses as the boy and his crippled brother valiantly march off in the snow to a future we know will not be pleasant.";

	schema:reviewBody "In his most recent film A Time for Drunken Horses Director Bahman Ghobadi depicts the hardship of life in the Kurdish region straddling the border between Iran and Iraq.At the beginning of the film a truck full of children makes its way through the snowy Iranian mountains. The large group of children sing in Arabic about how the winding road makes them older. You get the sense that they don't really know what they are singing about but the song is indicative of how many of these children will be thrust into the realities of adulthood with little warning and even less preparation.A young Kurd Ayoub must avert government brutality and raise the money to pay for an operation for his ailing younger brother.Their father has just been killed by authorities and the teen must work to provide for the rest of the family. The only way he can raise the money is by smuggling goods across the border from Iraq to Iran risking extremely cold temperatures land mines and military raids.Much to his credit Ghobadi uses locals instead of professional actors throughout the film. The children who portray the three major characters Ayoub his sister Amaneh and their young disabled brother Madi give brilliant fresh performances. Ayoub and Amaneh are convincing as a brother and sister attempting to hold their family together.These children shed real tears. In a particularly impressive moment Ayoub wrestles to move a drunken mule who won't budge as troops with rifles converge on his convoy. The power of his fear and frustration lights up the screen.By the same token some of the adult actors are unprofessional and wooden. Minor characters like Ayoub's uncle are painful to watch as they attempt to act. But thankfully these characters are periphery.As an artistic film coming from the Middle East one might not expect much from the technical aspects of the film. The cinematography however rivals some of the slickest Hollywood productions. The sweeping iceblue snow that lines the mountains in the film provides a stark contrast with the characters' bright costumes particularly Madi's trademark tiny yellow raincoat.The textured sound design adds depth to the picture. The rich crisp amplification of even the tiniest sounds are an example of the film's attention to detail. From the buttoning of a coat to the smacking of lips small sounds stand out and give the film an intimate feel.The film derives its title from the mules that are given alcohol so they'll traverse the snowy terrain.At the end of the film when Ayoub is trying to get Madi across the border the drunken mules turn out to be a blessing in disguise.And the ambiguous final shot will make you cringe.Briskly paced the film unearths beauty in simplicity. Ghobadi clearly is a talented director and in this film about growing up too fast he paints a beautiful sad picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "With their mother long dead twelveyear old Ayoub becomes the head of the family over his four brothers and sisters. Taking up the dangerous smuggling runs of his father Ayoub is put in an even more difficult situation when he learns that his youngest brother the severely handicapped Madi is getting steadily worse and will need an operation to live any longer than the next few months. With the dangers involved Ayoub sets out to make the journey and the money to get Mani the operation he needs.I had never heard of this film before I watched it nor had I heard anything about it  I just was interested to see an Iranian film my first I think. Despite having now read the many comments on this site about the film I must confess that I was not as taken by it as everyone else seems to have been. What it does well is to present us with quite a convincing view of the general hardships and lifestyles of those living in this area and as such it is pretty interesting. However when you take a look at the plot it doesn't actually fit with the film's aim of realism. Firstly not a great deal happens and the film is not as consistently involving as it really should have been  even as a documentary style film it has several points where it drags quite heavily. The actual subject of the film rather undermines the reality of the situation even if it is used to emotionally involve the audience easier than a straight documentary may have done.What I mean by this is the plot device of Madi  in the Western world I can accept a story where others will really put themselves out for others fianically however in this situation I found it to be unconvincing that Ayoub would risk the immediate future of the rest of his family for the sake of Madi who lets be honest was never going to live for very long even with the operation. If he was my brother I would do anything but I didn't buy that they would be able to spend the money knowing that they would save Madi but maybe condemn the whole lot of them to starvation etc. It did make me more emotionally involved in the film but I have to wonder how much more involving it would have been if Madi's suffering would have been just yet another unchangeable part of this family's situation.The cast are pretty good considering the fact that none of them are actors and in contrast to many Western movies it is the children who are vastly superior to the adults. While many of the grownups seem uncomfortable in front of the camera and only act natural when in crowds the children are best in the smaller moments. In particular Ahmadi's Ayoub is a very sympathetic character and is a good way to get into the story likewise it is very difficult not to get emotionally involved when you see Ekhtiardini crying and crying over just one of his daily injections. However out of the rest of the cast there isn't enough material to go around and too few of the ensemble cast have much to do but hang around and look deprived! The direction is great and manages to blend the beauty of the scenery with the desolation of the lives to good effect  that sounds a bit pompous but I can't describe it any other way!This is a slow film that doesn't have the plot that it deserved and it may alienate the casual viewer but it is still worth the effort. The acting of the main children is very convincing the direction captures the beauty of Iran as well as the sheer grind of the characters' lives and the film is mostly interesting. Only weaknesses in plotting stop it from being better.".

The indescribable state of people living in harsh conditions are best put forth by an objective narrative without any attempts to milk the situation in an attempt to tug at the emotional chords of the viewers.A Time for Drunken Horses is a must see an indispensable gem to the list of many from Iranian directors. While it is not suited for the audience looking for a pop corn film nor is it meant to appease or please it does have moments that will stay with you.

While I can hardly imagine why any mass audience would like to see stark realities especially ones they wish and are thankful to have escaped the film is an experience one that makes it essential viewing.";

The same ill treatment the same struggle even for children. I saw all those things in the movie in my childhood around me. The thing with this movie is that all those things are true. In fact it is a story out of thousand stories. Every Kurd child has such a story to be filmed in those regions. The players though all amateurs were perfect. Ayoub Amine Rojine were wonderful in acting. There was not a particular story but that is the way it should be as I told you each child there has such a story in his life time. So I was proud as a Kurd to have seen this movie. It deserves the awards it has obtained and now I am looking forward to seeing another movie by Ghobadi.".

It's just a slice of life. There actually isn't much of a message other than you gotta do for your family what you gotta do. It's truly eyeopening the lengths that people will go to in order to simply survive.

	schema:reviewBody "First off A Time For Drunken Horses is a movie that I enjoyed but I would not call it a good movie. Shot in the documentary style it feels more like a documentary than a fictionalized film. It portrays the hardships of the Kurdish people and one family as they try to survive in a world that the American viewers have no concept of. A film generally does tell of hardships such as these but the difference between A Time For Drunken Horses and other films is that the others create a story that makes its subject matter more understandable. That's the point of a story to explain things we can't know otherwise.Directed by Bahman Ghobadi the shots are set up with expertise and the snowy landscapes are very impressive. Visually this film is a masterpiece with its style and cinematography. Ghodabi's actors all amateurs don't display the same raw talent as their director but will suffice and must be forgiven as they are only amateurs playing themselves. Perhaps the subtitles make it harder to gauge their abilities but no matter what their facial expressions don't amount to enough to garner the emotions that the scene requires.Emotions though are not in short supply. This situations here become so extreme and never redeeming that it is hard not to view the whole film as a ploy to garner cheap tears from its viewers. It's analogous to American directors who add unnecessary nudity to their films just to get the few extra dollars from the demographic that pays just to see Angelina Jolie naked not caring what the movie is actually about. There comes a point in A Time For Drunken Horses that you have to ask what the point is. Yes this is educational for those of us who don't live like this but what about those that do? Imagine this a car wreck a bad one with blood death and visible pain. That is what this movie is similar to. An event that you see every day but don't directly relate to. It's horrible and you know it so why watch a movie about it. Would you want to watch a car wreck happen for eighty minutes? Where's the redemption? There is nothing to be gained from watching this. There's nothing that Ghodadi says with his film that the evening news doesn't. I see hundreds of films a year. I find that people often feel required to say that they enjoyed a foreign film. Perhaps they don't want to seem ignorant about what they are watching. For example in Ebert's review he accuses those who don't like this movie of lacking in empathy. A well made foreign film has a great chance to make it to the American film market but that doesn't mean that it is a good movie. Just because a book is grammatically correct and follows the required structure to a T does not mean it is enjoyable. It's all about content and the conviction the writer has in what they are saying. With A Time For Drunken Horses I felt more like I was watching an educational piece the History Channel had produced more than a story someone had put their blood and tears into. I would say it is a good movie but I probably would not recommend this. I think A Time For Drunken Horses has more political message than heartbreaking conviction. ".

As his first fulllength feature Gobadi aims as he tells us in the prologue to make the viewers aware of the plight of the people of Kurdistan who are unjustly marginalized and neglected their situation becoming all the more worst as the village stands on the border between the warring Iran and Iraq it's the time of the Gulf War.As I've already suggested the focus here is particularly on the orphaned Kurdish siblings headed by the affectionate and vulnerable Ayoub.To support his brothers and sisters and most specially the ailing Madi who needs to be operated in Iraq Ayoub works for a group of smugglers who uses children in transporting illegallyobtained goods to Iraq.      The opening scene of a pressurefilled and hurriedlydone packing of smuggled products presented with the use of a handheld camera and undiluted colors so that it has the look and feel of a documentary and the shots of the snowcovered mountain along which the group of adults and children carry their goods in a manner that is threatening rather than aweinspiring make it clear that the road ahead for the young protagonists won't be a smooth one that life won't be a piece of cake as should be proper for them being tender and innocent as they are.      Though Gobadi chooses to present the story objectively that is in a manner where sympathy and hate won't be readily expressed to the persons concerned being aware of the fact that theirs is a life being largely conditioned by the circumstances I still think that the film belongs to the children  most specially to Ayoub.      It's hard not to admire Ayoub's selfless devotion to his siblings even if it means having to be used callously by a group of adult smugglers one of them is an uncle having to endure the coldness the thick blanket of snow and the steepness of the mountains as they transport the goods using drunken horses hence the title and having to sacrifice an elder sister to an arranged marriage in the hope of having Madi operated courtesy of the groom's family which turns out to be a false hope.      One would think that such kind of fate is too much for a young child but like the abovementioned Iranian films Zamani baraye masti ashba ends with the image of a child quietly enjoying a moment of triumph.What will become of him or her from thereon? Whatever what counts for the time being is the simple joy brought about by a simple victory.".

But the first half of the film is overly quiet and slow and there are also a number of lowkey scenes that have selfevidently been written and shot that way not for effect but for budgetary reasons the car chase for example is supremely lowenergy while other critical moments occur offcamera.

	schema:reviewBody "I viewed The Hunter at TIFF entering the theatre without having researched anything about the film. The only thing I knew was that it was an Iranian film. Essentially I went in with an open mind and zero expectations yet I still came out fairly disappointed.The film kicks off full of energy with a still referencing tense relations enjoyed between Iran and America since 1979. We meet a lowerclass average man named Ali who sports the same sullen face from beginning to end. Is he angry simply because his employment as a watchman doesn't afford him much time to see his family or is there a deeper plot about his time spent in prison? We never find out. Why did he go to prison? We never find out.Occasionally Ali steals away from the city where he's bombarded with political propaganda which again is not touched upon in any detail to a quiet area in the country he knows very well a hunter and his trusty rifle alone in the wilderness. Ali stalks an unknown prey and fires off a couple shots probably the most exciting part of the film as the gunshots are devastatingly loud. What is he hunting? We never find out. Does he actually kill anything or bring it back home? We never find out. He must be the most incompetent hunter in the world or he's letting off some steam. We never find out  especially given that he maintains the same sullen face upon returning home.Even when his family dies as a result of a shootout between the police and insurgents Ali oddly expresses little if any reaction. Was his wife secretly an insurgent and did he know? or was she merely caught in the crossfire as the police told him? We never find out. Why does he express zero emotion at the sight of his dead child's body? We never find out.Eventually with nothing to lose he finally expresses some talent in hunting by plucking off two police officers driving down the highway. With the authorities chasing after him you'd expect some feelings of anxiety or excitement but it's too strewn out to be much enjoyed. Worse a second plot that develops about the corruption of the two police officers who apprehend Ali drags out long enough for me to check my watch.The Hunter is a film that appears constantly to reach for deeper themes deeper emotion and a deeper plot but always falls short. Any promising element succumbs to extreme minimalism which ironically destroys the element of art in film making by trying to be so artistic. It's not ambiguous it's vague. It's not subtle it's empty. And it's not patient it's boring.Such minimalism causes the viewer to imagine plot development and it is the source of major frustration. It's like imagining vivid additions to a canvas painted in a single colour but why are we making stuff up in our minds when the art piece should be guiding us along to the story? There is so much rich substance the director Rafi Pitts who stars as Ali could have incorporated even slightly into the plot  namely Ali's past and his and his family's involvement with national politics. A quick and simple explanation that he served time for involvement in insurgent activities for example would have connected beautifully to his murder of two authorities from the state.In my opinion it wouldn't have taken much for Rafi Pitts to incorporate greater elements of political tension or character development and background as it's obvious there is a lot of rich substance to be drawn. Ultimately The Hunter is a draft sketch of a screenplay prematurely put to the camera.I'm sure an ivory tower film critic somewhere would praise The Hunter for its deep questions but the reality is that the only question most will have after viewing the film is What the hell actually happened in that hour and a half? And in case I entirely wrong about The Hunter and I am actually too blind to notice a deeper connotation in the film I award it 1 star out of 10.".

We never find out  especially given that he maintains the same sullen face upon returning home.Even when his family dies as a result of a shootout between the police and insurgents Ali oddly expresses little if any reaction. Was his wife secretly an insurgent and did he know? or was she merely caught in the crossfire as the police told him? We never find out. Why does he express zero emotion at the sight of his dead child's body? We never find out.Eventually with nothing to lose he finally expresses some talent in hunting by plucking off two police officers driving down the highway. With the authorities chasing after him you'd expect some feelings of anxiety or excitement but it's too strewn out to be much enjoyed. Worse a second plot that develops about the corruption of the two police officers who apprehend Ali drags out long enough for me to check my watch.The Hunter is a film that appears constantly to reach for deeper themes deeper emotion and a deeper plot but always falls short. Any promising element succumbs to extreme minimalism which ironically destroys the element of art in film making by trying to be so artistic. It's not ambiguous it's vague. It's not subtle it's empty. And it's not patient it's boring.Such minimalism causes the viewer to imagine plot development and it is the source of major frustration. It's like imagining vivid additions to a canvas painted in a single colour but why are we making stuff up in our minds when the art piece should be guiding us along to the story? There is so much rich substance the director Rafi Pitts who stars as Ali could have incorporated even slightly into the plot  namely Ali's past and his and his family's involvement with national politics. A quick and simple explanation that he served time for involvement in insurgent activities for example would have connected beautifully to his murder of two authorities from the state.In my opinion it wouldn't have taken much for Rafi Pitts to incorporate greater elements of political tension or character development and background as it's obvious there is a lot of rich substance to be drawn. Ultimately The Hunter is a draft sketch of a screenplay prematurely put to the camera.I'm sure an ivory tower film critic somewhere would praise The Hunter for its deep questions but the reality is that the only question most will have after viewing the film is What the hell actually happened in that hour and a half? And in case I entirely wrong about The Hunter and I am actually too blind to notice a deeper connotation in the film I award it 1 star out of 10.";

	schema:headline " An interesting Iranian thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "As this film opens we see protagonist Ali a hunter loading his rifle in a forest we then learn that he works as a night watchman at a factory in Tehran. He is married with a young daughter. His life is fairly mundane until one day he gets a phone call from the police it turns out his wife have been killed in the crossfire in a shootout between the police and insurgents they have no idea what happened to his daughter though. Ali then sets about looking for his young daughter without any luck eventually he learns that she too has died. Sitting on a hill above a busy dualcarriageway he takes out his rifle and fires at a police car it swerves and comes to a halt then he shoots and kills the policeman who gets out. He flees the city but is caught by two cops in the forest. By the time they have caught up with him though they are well and truly lost one of them wants to kill Ali for what he has done but the other won't let him as tensions rise it looks as though the two policemen are a danger to each other as well as Ali inevitably it will end in tragedy.Inevitably much of this films interest comes not from its contents but from the fact that it was made in the Islamic Republic of Iran not a country most westerners would associate with film making. I suspect the biggest surprise for most viewers will be the fact that the characters don't seem that much different to those who might appear in a film made in the west. That isn't to say the film looks like something that came out of Hollywood it certainly doesn't. The pace is much much slower there is almost no music and there is little explanation for example we aren't told how the two policemen realised Ali was the man they were after and we don't see the moment they catch him one moment they are chasing him the next he has his hands tied behind his back. Rafi Pitts does a fine job as Ali a man who is clearly broken by what happened to his family and barely cares what will happen to him once he is caught. Overall I'd say that while this isn't the most exciting thriller it is worth watching if only for the glimpse it provides into a country that rarely gets positive coverage.".

Although I several times predicted where it was going it still disrupts and undermines our notions of where it fits into our typology of films as the festival writeup indicated.Say that there is no plot overlooks the significance of the whole trajectory and fails to relate later events to earlier ones obviously I cannot spell it out but to understand it it is important to pay attention to what is said to the hunter in the woods. That information explains his earlier actions which seemed motiveless or arising from some nihilistic and sleepdepriving reactive despair but which turn out to build on events that we have not been shown.Knowing at this point what he has done we can maybe guess why we were given detail earlier about his daughter that had been kept from him but which he might have uncovered and could have made him see his family life differently. Or he might have had some extreme and pathological reaction to the conditions of his existence.We already knew something about his past and can soon see that he has something of the stamp of a loner that is seen in TAXIDRIVER content to drive around in his car and wait for first light to hunt. These are important elements in both films and I was soon reminded of this one's older brother.Dialogue is sparing in both films and they share the desire for revenge that comes over characters at what cannot be tolerated in someone else's behaviour. That coupled with the recurrent impulse here to implicate others is at the heart of this film.It is one of quiet scenes into which sudden loud noises tear and where threat and intimidation inject by the nature of their origin onward twists that lead to the final scene and complete what for me is a very definite structure. That being said if one expected this film to spill its explanation into one's lap it will remain tightly closed as a storybook and seem to have taken the viewer nowhere.I rate this film highly but there is one niggle to do with how the ending is set up with our three figures in isolation and a good misdirection that others will be on the scene the hunter is given something by one man but irrespective of whether it was his own it would not only have been traceable to him but his fingerprints would also have been inexplicably all over it.

With a rare movies from 'talkies' era like this it's quite common. At some moments i had the feeling that subtitles may be more or less incomplete and did not reveal all details of sophisticated language but still i found dialogues interesting and the overall story was easy to understand.The movie focuses on indian campaign of Alexander the Great and depicts it more from indian perspective  meaning at some point we can see Alexander more like invader and king Porus like idealised protector of homeland. From the very beginning we see impressive decorations of palace settings  I was very surprised to see such good depiction of foreign costumes in an indian movie although in closer look a nimble eye can see fakeness of all greek armors. Visuals are the stongest side of the movie  although camera work isn't so impressive and sometimes diminishes the aestetic effectiveness of scenery. Battle scenes in movie  they are different... Sometimes depiction is nominal and sometimes we can see an elephant charge through infantry made without any special effects  absolutly mindblowing!Although the story is not very complicated the movie has very slow pace. Some simple dialogue scenes are more several minutes long. Its good to show character's deepest motivations but in the middle of the film we know motivations of every character quite well  and neverthenless movie has this slow temp to the end.Few words about characters  there is some very distinct and interesting ones. Alexandr is depicted always optimistic and joyful neverlosing young conqueror  pretty realistic in my opinion. Rukhsana is just adorable in her youth and passion. Aristotle showed here very astere and cold but later we see that there is still humanity beneath logics of the wise. And of course Porus  an idealized nearchakravarti ideal ruler in buddhism in this movie still has a stong bit of charm in his allaboutvirtues attitude of mind.What an indian movie without songs? There is some not too much and they are pretty lovely although one song choice still make me scratch my head  a greek soldiers singing 'Life is all about love' while marching on conquest? That must be some bad translation or maybe here comes that long expected cultural difference?..".

This is mainly because the fabulous director Douglas Sirk doesn't allow it to become a soppy schmaltz. Also the film is incredibly moving especially in a scene at the beginning where a young man unable to live with the guilt of having shot a woman shoots himself. John Gavin is good as Ernst Graeber and his beloved is adequately played by Liselotte Pulver but the most outstanding performance I think is by Charles Rgnier as Joseph. If more war films were made like this then they would be much much more watchable. The credit sequence at the beginning of the film is also very well done. Why don't more people know this masterpiece? Enjoy! and don't forget the Kleenex 1010".

Hope comes to him through falling in love with a charming girl Lilo Pulver whom he kisses by the emerging blossoms next to the river. They marry and enjoy whatever happiness they can. They revel in it as you you do but a gloom hangs over the film. This is also represented by the colour scheme employed by Sirk. Instead of the bright 'Scope of WOTW or ATHA here we have slate greys and smoky blues. His use of mis en scene here is also kind of remarkable with the grotesque German officer who Gavin visits having what seem to be hundreds of dead trophy animals adorning his walls. Memento's of the dead perhaps? Remarque wrote the novel and also appears in the film. Challenging moving and heartbreaking with an ending that shocks and angers yet is also justified.".

However the first time I watched this movie I was really amazed at how well it was done as well as the most excellent cast for a movie and the realism that it showed. Also I do not care for films with much romancing in it however I liked this film and how the romance between a German Soldier and some Fraulein was shown.Young German soldier returns to a devastated hometown on leave from the Eastern Front. First he tries to locate his family after discovering their home was destroyed on some bombing raid. Whilst looking for family he runs into an old professor of his as well as his daughter. During his time on leave he falls in love with this girl and they eventually get married. Also the professor had been arrested for some reason and was shucked away to some interrogation center  which really was a Concentration Camp. Sometime later in the movie this soldier discovers the professors fate.During his leave this soldier befriends and teams up with another soldierwho is also looking for a loved one. Don DeFore excellently plays that soldier. Also in the film in memorable roles include Keenan Wynn as a rich German Corporal Jock Mahoney as Steinbrenner a crack machinegunner who is in Gavin's Graebers platoon as well as a very young Dana Jim Hutton as a young German soldier in Graebers platoon.I do not want to spoil what happens at the end of this movie but will say that Graeber gets sent back to his platoon somewhere on the Eastern Front.This movie is so good that it really deserves to be released on DVD. It is in color and the sound is excellent.".

	schema:reviewBody "The films of Douglas Sirk have been variously described as masterpieces and tosh.  I think the answer lies somewhere in between.  Certainly the series he made at the peak of his career for Universal International in the 'fifties are romantic melodramas of a superior kind.  Although photographed in gaudy chocolatebox colours with soundtracks overladen with scores drenched in aural syrup and with sometimes the most outlandish of plots  Magnificant Obsession for instance  they have beneath their surface glitter a hard edged observation of an affluent American society struggling to come to grips with moral values  All that Heaven Allows and Imitation of Life are particularly good examples.  But interesting as these film are it is the odd man out a film set not in America at all but in Germany and the eastern front in the closing stages of the Second World War A Time to Love and  a Time to Die that in spite of its not inconsiderable unevenness could well be his most lasting legacy.  Its most striking feature is that notwithstanding its vastly different territory it remains a Sirk film stylistically.  The director almost seems to be signing his signature with the shot of pink blossom against the opening and closing credits.  Although the outer sections of a German unit under shellfire on the eastern front are the very stuff of warscape recreation at their near best it is the long central passage where the young German soldier  surprisingly well played by John Gavin  returns on leave to his heavily bombed town that is the most Sirkian.  Here between devastating airaids the hero forms an idyllic romantic attachment to a vaguely remembered friend from childhood followed by a whirlwind courtship.  Amazingly for the last night of his leave the couple find amidst all the devastation an untouched house  for the consumation of their marriage where they are tended by  a kindly frau who brings them a bottle of wine from the cellar.  At this point the airaid is only glimpsed through the window.  At an earlier point in the leave the couple dine in an unbelievably stylish restaurant although here at least Sirk has the honesty to interrupt the proceedings with a pretty devastating direct hit which leaves one diner running is a sea of flames. If I have reservations about some of the romantic trappings of the scenes in Germany I have none about the intense realism of the scenes on the eastern front.  Would that the film was all on this level.".

Yes many of Sirk's familiar touches are here. But this is not a carbon copy of his hit soap operas. This film is affecting if overlylong with two surprisingly good leads in the impossibly handsome John Gavin and the lovely Lilo Pulver. Sirk does gloss up the devastation of war a bit however Sirk does allow this movie to have its share of shockingly frank and disturbing moments.John Gavin plays German soldier Ernst who returns to his hometown on furlough. What he finds are the tattered remains of his home and goes on a search for his missing parents. During his frantic search Gavin meets a childhood acquaintance. Among the air raids bombings and sheer terror they develop a romance and marry. Knowing that their time together will be short they milk every moment for what it's worth before inevitable tragedy destroys their romance.Gavin who was cast more frequently for his good looks than his acting chops actually makes a passable lead this time although his playing a German is a little bit of a stretch. While this is not Douglas Sirk at his finest it is an interesting project that capitalizes on the popularity of war films while also allowing Sirk to immerse himself in a topic that comes straight from his own past.".

Sirk does gloss up the devastation of war a bit however Sirk does allow this movie to have its share of shockingly frank and disturbing moments.John Gavin plays German soldier Ernst who returns to his hometown on furlough. What he finds are the tattered remains of his home and goes on a search for his missing parents. During his frantic search Gavin meets a childhood acquaintance. Among the air raids bombings and sheer terror they develop a romance and marry. Knowing that their time together will be short they milk every moment for what it's worth before inevitable tragedy destroys their romance.Gavin who was cast more frequently for his good looks than his acting chops actually makes a passable lead this time although his playing a German is a little bit of a stretch. While this is not Douglas Sirk at his finest it is an interesting project that capitalizes on the popularity of war films while also allowing Sirk to immerse himself in a topic that comes straight from his own past.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film complements The Downfall in putting a human face on the Germans who fought during WWII and the suffering of the people of Dresden during the allied bombing but it beat the Downfall by 47 years!! The problem is that Sirk is a highly underrated director because he shot mostly melodramas in the 1950's America starring the likes of Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman who was Ronald Reagan's wife at the time!! so his German films are not even known in America. This is one of them. It's an important film that speaks for the simple people the common people of Germany who also suffered on the German side. And the writing credits are not bad including Erich Maria Remarque who wrote All Quiet on the Western Front. This film and The Downfall should be seen along with The Fog of War in which Robert McNamara who was Secretary of Defense during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and the Vietnam War confesses that if the Germans and the Japanese had won the war he and his superiors would have been tried for war crimes for ordering the fire bombing of both Dresden and Tokyo during the war. War is hell and everyone bar none on all sides has committed atrocities. McNamara at 87 has the courage to admit that Sometimes you have to do evil to do good as he put it. The victor writes history... he added. Films like A Time to Love and a Time to Die and The Downfall add a bit of revisionary touch to the cracks in that history...".

	schema:reviewBody "I can recommend this war film. Despite distracting weaknesses in production quality the power of the material carries the viewer along very effectively. The scenario is the dying days of World War II from the perspective of a German soldier. This represents unusual material for Hollywood and romantic leading man John Gavin is odd casting as the hero. Although his flashes of American pearly whites are incongruous he and indeed all the actors do quite well in their parts although hampered by the forced pace of the direction and the artificial quality of the sound recording. Clearly overdubbed the dialogue has the quality of a read through in an indoor studio despite most of the action being outofdoors. The cinematography is quite good and the sets impressive as the soldier Ernst moves from the horrors of the Russian front to the heavilybombed hometown where he returns on leave. Trying to find what has become of his parents he receives little sympathy from his countrymen and women who are deadened or maddened by the bombardment from the skies they are experiencing. Officialdom is represented by a range of repulsive types underlining the moral ambiguity the hero is struggling with after his experiences on the front. Where in all this horror is anything worth living for? The answer comes in his developing relationship with the winsome Elizabeth portrayed by a delightful actress whose name is not familiar to me. What hopes of happiness in the maelstrom of the times? A poignant moment comes when the couple fantasize where they would like to go for a honeymoon only to reflect that as Germans they would be hated just about everywhere. I found this a memorable film.".

Here the Amish do the job and they are the greater force that really tone him down while still giving him plenty of opportunities to be funny. The theme of materialism getting into the way of relationships is needed in 2006 even more than in 1997 when this movie was released. It would be well for everyone to rewatch it now to realize that materialism has gotten totally out of control in today's world. Another thing that makes this movie enjoyable is that it isn't frantic like most comedies are. Too many try to emulate the Marx Brothers. In the frantic lives we do lead today to sustain our materialism it is nice to have something slower paced yet still not bore you to death.".

You'll find a film that is generally heartwarming sincerely funny and underneath its comedy exterior a good moral tale. Allen and Alley assume the roles of two Amish folk to escape the IRS. As their lawyer fights to get them acquitted they find a whole new world they had been missing while enjoying caviar and martinis. You might not be able to get the modern world into the Amish but maybe you'll find a little bit of Amish in us modern folk. While not something you must see recommended if you're stuck home and you see it listed on Comedy Central. You could do worse.".

Sold everything in New York moved and bought a farm in Virginia. People are much nicer down here. It's a slower pace and people even open the doors for you. I even have started saying Yawl. I know nothing about farming but the people in the community helped us with out charging a dime. But all good things must come to an end. So many people have moved down here from up North. Had a man come up to me last summer said I had to cut my grass it was ruining his property value. He was head of home owners assoc. and he was going to write a citation. He lived at the closet house to house about a mile and half away. The grass he wanted me to cut was the front 100 acres It was a hay field. I told him he was trespassing and to kindly leave property. Funny thing he had just moved down here not 6 months ago from not even 2 miles from wear we lived in the city. point is he needs to watch this movie".

Yes some of it is farfetched and highly unrealistic but folks it's a FILM! Why must everything be reality these days?! Reality can really suck sometimes and an escape with a movie like this is just the ticket to two hours worth of wishing life could really be like this. I thought the actors portraying the Yoder family performed extremely well and were immediately likable. I am a Pennsylvanian and have been to the Amish Country countless times. I know this film was shot on location in Maryland but it really does closely resemble the Amish Farmlands in Lancaster County PA. Who cares what the critics thought in 1997.

Sanders are standing in the corn field and Tim is marveling that the corn he had struggled to plant is growing so tall and full. Jay then says that he finds it ironic that the English have always viewed the Amish as backward and as hiding from reality. Then he points towards to growing corn and says But this is the reality....it is not we who are hiding. Kirstie Allen and Tim Allen as well as wellknown character actors Wayne Knight and Larry Miller provide big laughs throughout. Great writing some interesting side stories beautiful landscapes and an interesting window into Amish life all make this movie a winner!".

Perhaps because of its Amish setting there is a particular timelessness about the concept of city slickers in trouble with the law and with a marriage on the rocks rediscovering older deeper values  and each other  that defies or goes beyond both this movie's sillier moments or easy attempts to ridicule or deride the piece on the part of the watcher. At some level there is a pleasant depth and warmth here that owes much to Tim Allen's approach to movies as nicely complemented by Kirstie Alley's surprisingly tangible sexiness ... and considerable capacity for comedy. The fact that both play characters incompetent and out of their depth in the midst of the simplicity and incredible hard work of the rural idyll in which they find themselves for them actually a refuge from the IRS is fun but far augmented by the actuak willingness of the characters to adapt muck in and keep trying which ultimately yields its rewards. And the reward for us watching is to note the attimes sweet and subtle ways in which our misfitting pair experiencing strained relations gradually come back to each other. Those not made of stone will find themselves rooting for the couple willing them to get back together  and that surely has much to say about the good and the bad but also the essential value and sweetness and even sanctity of the muchderided institution of marriage. If the Amish presentation is a bit onedimensional well it's certainly not hostile indeed doing much to suggest that this lifestyle is an ideal one that can change much for the better.It's actually surprising that one even feels the need to raise such issues in the context of what looks at first glance like nothing more than a lightweight screwball comedy but then that is really a tribute to this film which in my view achieves quite a bit more than it sets out to.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shinya Tsukamoto's Tetsuo has been one of my favourite ultra underground Japanese films for some time now. I've watched it many times and the film is always as effective stunning and outstanding as it was when I first saw it. Now I viewed it again last night and I am totally shocked and speechless when it comes to this masterpiece of Shinya Tsukamoto the genius multi talent behind films like Tokyo Fist just don't try to watch if you think Raging Bull is too much Gemini and Bullet Ballet. If I had to choose one film among all the films that really blew me away like this I'd probably choose Tetsuo.The plot and premise is simple. A metal fetishist played by the director himself inserts pieces of metal into his own body with often bloody results understandably. He becomes run down by a car after which the fetishist starts to have very severe changes in his body and starts to mutate into humanmetal monster and the man who ran him down starts to have similar changes in his body too.. What follows is 60 minutes of total surreal mayhem nightmarish imagery and use of perhaps all the imaginable cinematic techniques in editing photography and music. You have been warned!It is hard to describe with words the power of this film which has often been referred as a combination of Lynch Cronenberg and of course Anime and Scifi. The photography is stunning to say the least as director's 16mm camera twists turns runs falls climbs zooms and does all the possible ways the director could invent to create this kind of atmosphere. The film consists of very fast edits flashbacks nightmare sequences and images and fast forward photography that spiced with incredible soundtrack is something never before seen. The soundtrack is made with different sounds of metal hitting together scratching against something and most notable there is also synthesizer use to create very ominous and threatening atmosphere that never stops and the music is again one of the most important elements of this film.The effects are totally outstanding as the director made them by himself. The film is black and white and that is of course great choice to nightmare film like this. Tsukamoto also wrote directed photographed art directed and edited this film among special effects and the most help he got came probably from Kei Fujiwara who plays the girl friend in the movie and she also directed her own similar film Organ in the middle of the 90's. It is incredible how Tsukamoto managed to do all this by himself and the help of some others but due to his talent it all becomes possible. This film is very low budget but it is the kind of punch to senses that only very few big budget films have managed to give. If I had to choose one big budgeted film that has almost equally stunning atmosphere and power I'd mention Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream which is another masterpiece from this young directorwriter. Still Requiem and Tetsuo are very different films but their power is almost  if not entirely  equal.The theme of the film is obviously the fear of technology and how far it will be developed. The film ends pretty pessimistically and it underlines the fears and threats that are in the air and were in Tsukamoto's mind too. The images of huge metal machines and motors at the beginning of the movie are very ominous and the machines seem to be alive and are very nightmarish overall even though they should be DEAD machines because metal doesn't live at least yet. This reminded me of work of David Lynch and his Eraserhead and Lost Highway which both create something very ominous dangerous and very scary with these similar techniques of close ups of water spilling engines working and smoke coming closer. Just remember the images of radiator and coffeepot in Eraserhead and mystery man and smoke among many others in Lost Highway. The feeling in Tetsuo is exactly similar even though the things themselves are not scary or threatening because they should be only dead pieces of metal and plastic products in other words.Shinya Tsukamoto made also sequel to Tetsuo but it is in color and never as stunning as this brilliant original but still worth checking out for lovers of this kind of cinema. Shinya Tsukamoto is among Takeshi Kitano Takashi Ishii and Takashi Miike the most interesting personal creatively lunatic and overall stunning artists to come from Japan today and by watching their films all the nonsense entertainment coming too often from Hollywood nowadays is easy to forget and just concentrate on these miracles in the field of cinema. Cinema is magic and Tetsuo is one example to show that for the lovers of independent films since this is not going to reveal to mainstream audience due to its difficult imagery violent scenes of nightmarish terror and overall personality that demands a lot from the viewer. This is far too difficult and intelligent cinema for mainstream audience and thus would never come out from some big studio that wants only money and commercially potential films.Tetsuo is a 1010 masterpiece and one of my personal favourites. I've tried to describe this film as clearly as possible and without using too many praising adjectives and since this movie's power is somewhat hard to describe with words I recommend that all the lovers of Japanese cinema and the ones who think they're interested in Tetsuo check this out and see and experience the magic for themselves.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another one of those films where you have the sheer brilliance 1010 battling against the worst film of all time 110 people. I'm not partial to either I wanted to see this film after watching a preview that was so intense it made my brain hurt. So I absolutely had to pick it up at the video store.Tetsuo more than anything is absolutely surreal. The cinematography and camera work is way ahead of its time and I have never seen anything quite like it. The stop motion and use of metal twine and scrap is stunning and also menacing especially with the heavy industrialelectronic soundtrack thumping throughout most of the film. I imagine that some scenes must have taken ages to go through frame by frame and create the visual image of cyberpunk terror that is conveyed in this film.Besides these things I can't credit the film for much else. Some say it's impossible to follow but the story is quite simple. A metal fetishist that has been inserting pieces of metal into his body is hit by a car and begins to transform and haunt the person responsible. Then he begins to transform and his world quickly spirals down as he becomes the metal obsessed monster that his crash victim was already into. However there are lots of parts of this film that don't contribute to the overall image of the film and a few scenes that could have been replaced with something entirely different and were a little slow and unnecessary. While hilarious there is a scene involving the man and his woman as credited that while serving a purpose became more of a sick joke than a part of the film.As the movie continues on you get more and more lost as to what is going on when cuts become more frequent and the film becomes extremely frantic and fast paced. I viewed it a second time to see if I missed anything but I felt the same after a second view. Tetsuo is good for its expiremental editing and cinematography and has its place in cyberpunk filmography. But if you're looking for a film with solid scriptwriting and direction you're not going to be happy.Sheer genius? On some aspects yes. Worst movie ever? You have to be kidding me. There isn't much talking in this film and the worst films ever have way too much talking in them. Sometimes it's nice to have the actors shut up and maybe scream in terror at a piece of metal sticking out of their face instead.".

It's filmed in contrasty blackandwhite. Each frame is cramped and chaotic much of the time it's filled with wires pipes chainlink fences and all the other incidental debris of life in the late 20th century... which suddenly seems significant and even menacing.Towards the fiftyminute mark it's 67 min. total the willful excess starts to feel a little too excessive perhaps the manga influence is a bit too strong. But Tetsuo finishes strong with an end that's at once unexpected and inevitable. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Japan is a crazy country. Their workaholism is affecting western culture all the time. Coming to Tokyo first time one can get lost not only in translation hehe but mostly in all these technological gadgets that leave you with only three questions what the hell is this for? what the hell is that for? and how the hell does it work?. On one side coming to Japan one might see something very rare today amazing technology next to tradition remains of culture hundreds and thousands years old. But on the other Japanese does seem to have a lot of fear about all that technology. Won't that materialistic technological approach kill emotional and spiritual aspects of human existence? There has been made a lot of movies asking that question projecting hypothetical versions of future based on what Japan looks like today. See Ghost in the Shell for example. Yeah alright but what does Tetsuo have to do with all that crap? Everything. This Tsukamoto piece of art is a manifestation of great great fear of cold and soulless technology. Main character is a guy who has rather serious problem one day he notices that metal parts are slowly beginning to reveal themselves from under his skin. Why and what does it mean? Where will it lead to? You'll see. What I can say is that you don't need to live in Japan to enjoy this movie. The atmosphere is amazingly unconventional and can be compared only to other industrialantiindustrial masterpieces of Japanese cinema. The movie is black and white only all the time. Camera work is incredible it builds intense paranoid atmosphere. If you've seen other Shinya's movies you know what you can expect. The way the story is told with all these cutandpaste elements... oh God D If you've already seen some totally psychedout movies like this one you might get a laugh sometimes otherwise I guarantee you'll be strongly shocked because as I said before you probably haven't seen anything like this before so watch your back you have been warned  Budget used to make this movie may be equal to something like two cokes and a hamburger but as we can see some don't waste even that small amount of money. There are movies made with a little help of millions of dollars which are not even worth a cent. On the other side there are gems like this where you can't notice signs of lowbudget because it doesn't harm this movie even in one moment. I can't think of one thing I'd change in this movie. Highly recommended this one is a blast! PS. If you're willing to get some other Tsukamoto movies avoid Hiruko the Goblin.".

	schema:reviewBody "Title Tetsuo The Iron Man 1989 Director Shinya Tsukamoto Cast Tomorowo Taguchi Kei Fujiwara Nobu Kanaoka Shinya Sukamoto ReviewJust when you think you've seen it all....a movie like this comes around and totally kicks you in the butt! This movie was amazing! It needs more exposure! More people should check it out! OK OK let me get down to the review...but once more go rent this now! Story is about this regular every day ordinary guy who hits a pedestrian with his car. Only thing is that the pedestrian is a guy who is somehow becoming an...Iron Man. You see the guy they hit is a metal fetishist and for some reason that isn't explained he wants to become one with rusty pieces of metal. After the accident the man starts having nightmares about he and his girlfriend turning into robotic metallic things. When he wakes up he realizes that it could also be happening to him in real life.Man was this movie a visual feast! It was shot entirely in black and white but believe me it takes nothing away from the film. If anything it makes it all the more visually interesting.The movie reads in many ways like a nightmare on film. At least that was the first impression I got while I was watching it. In this sense it is strictly a horror movie. Some of the images are truly terrifying in a surreal dream like sort of way.The movies themes remind me a heck of a lot of David Cronenbergs films. You know how Cronenberg deals with films about sex and violence Shivers Crash The Brood and how they are somehow interconnected with each other? Well those themes are also touched upon in this movie in one of its most memorable scenes which I will not spoil...but will certainly surprise you. Even the part of the movie that deals with the car accident reminded me a bit of Cronenbergs Crash mainly because the couple decides to make out after the car accident.Not only that this movie also reminds me of a David Lynch movie...because yes at times it will seem incomprehensible. It took me two viewings to fully understand it but I got it pretty well the second time around. The story itself is not all that confusing...but the way it was edited and shot make it a little hard to grasp what is really happening. Its all very kinetic very fast always moving. The story moves along at a frenetic pace not giving you any chance to breath. Many people compare this film to Lynchs Erasehead and some even go as far to say that this film is even stranger and weirder than Eraserhead. I myself haven't had the chance to check out Eraserhead...but I know what type of films Lynch is capable of doing and if they say that Tetsuo The Iron Man is weirder then Eraserhead...well you know your in for something truly bizarre then.The gore in it is memorable with some really cringe inducing scenes...specially those where the man is transforming into the robot metal thing and he is having sex with his girlfriend.The special make up effects are great. Lots of cables and metal things coming out of every conceivable body part. Yes even there. Tetsuo the Iron Man looks like a huge hunk of metal coming to life with wires and cables and metallic objects. There's no real visual effects or CGI the effects are more practical and on camera. Lots of fast forwarding lots of quick cuts lots of stop motion animation lots of every quirky camera movements. It all helps to give the movie that incredibly frenetic look that it has.Overall this is a great Japanese horror film that shouldn't be missed by anyone! Its kind of like a mix between Lynch and Cronenberg and maybe even a little bit of George Romero in there! There was this scene with a girl turning into what felt like a zombie robot...that just reminded me of Night of the Living Dead. Its amazingly interesting in a visual sense and you will feel like if you ever had a dream about your body being over taken by rusty metals and wires...this is what it would definitely look like. Not to be missed.Rating 5 out of 5".

Soon the man appears to be hallucinating about people sprouting metal appendages until it begins to happen to him. Chunks of scrap metal grow like cancerous tumors.

If this isn't bad enough he soon finds out the man he hit played by the director of the film is in fact alive and rather peeved.Absolutely insane violence permeates the film which retains its punch through the black and white film.The review I read about this film compared it to Eraserhead A film I still have not seen which I believe says a lot about Eraserhead. To compare it to a film I've seen I'd say it reminds me of Un Chien Andalou with about three more lines of dialog and a lot more gore and violence.I also recommend the sequel Tetsuo II Body Hammer.

One I've only seen it twice and two I can never be absolutely sure that I've actually seen it once it's over. It's more like a series of feverish metallic images injected directly into your brain with a large bore needle. And I don't mean that in a bad way. Not at all. The first time I watched it it completely floored me even though I wasn't able to discern the faintest whiff of a plot. However after spending some time on the internet reading plot summaries provided by wirehead horror fanatics and anime buffs it became crystal clear the second time. To try to summarize it here would only make me sound like a lunatic and it would give no real idea of what goes on in the course of this movie. The rapidfire editing the moody black and white cinematography the spectacular grossout effects... sure they've all been done before but rarely have they been so effectively compressed into such an out of control mass of film. These images are completely unlike anything that would ever get a release in America. If you want the ultimate change of pace Tetsuo is your man. One more problem I should mention I usually think I have a high pretension threshold but even I had to chuckle at some scenes. If it were more grounded and had a more immediately discernible plot it'd be right up there with Pi on my list of paranoid brain twisters. But then again if it were these things it would not be Tetsuo. See it for what it is a pure adrenaline rush of film that today's blockbuster roller coaster rides can't hope to achieve.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well  sometime back in the early '90s I saw that a minor local theater was showing something called Tetsuo  The Bodyhammer. It claimed to be comic booklike and being a comic collector I went to see it. It was really weird with not much of a clear narrative. It was about a guy who could shoot rusty iron from his hands. Or something. It's a long time since I saw it. Anyway it turns out it was the sequel to the earlier Tetsuo  The Iron Man which is apparently a huge cult classic and a milestone in surrealist cinema.Last night I watched The Iron Man with some friends. I'm generally not into horror nor horrific surrealism and sure enough I did not enjoy watching this movie. I was grateful that it was only an hour long. However I do pride myself on being an appreciator of art movies and although I thought this movie was mostly just a piece of artsy selfindulgence I have to say it is interesting and difficult to come up with a good interpretation.Several possible interpretations struck me as I watched it and the other user comments here also mention some of them. Was it a movie about transhumanism about how our carnal vessels are nothing but trouble and we should replace them with superior adaptable changing metal bodies? Or was it about fear of invasive technology which alienates and dehumanizes us leaving us without compassion and conscience? A modern Kafkaesque Metamorphosis? Or was it a tale of a traumatic homosexual awakening which in fact many elements of the movie suggest? And what about the ending? Were the characters good or evil by the end? Was the movie hostile to technology or positive towards it? Opinions are divided possibilities are endless. The only thing definite that I and my friends could come up with was that the movie chronicles some kind of transition. A deeply stressful traumatic and accidentally triggered transition which includes all sorts of aspects of human life. But a transition which concludes in a new state of happiness. Perhaps the movie is simply a general description of the human condition and our passage from one set of circumstances to another  perhaps the change from natural man to technological man.It is to the movie's credit that there are so many possible interpretations but I do wonder how much of it is true art and how much of it is simply the director's fascination with weird effects. Still it is certainly an art movie and cannot be dismissed as trivial. It wasn't very enjoyable to me  noisy ugly repulsive confusing. I understand that these are the tools with which the movie makes its point but this is just not my idea of effective entertainment artistic or otherwise.7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tetsuo or Ironman is a very interesting movie that explores the themes of metal and flesh and how they interact......I think. The story is sketchy at best it's more of a visual assault on the senses. Tetsuo is some regular looking Japanese business man type dude who has a girlfriend. One day while shaving he notices a shard of metal protruding from his face. Metallic pieces of metal start spreading all over his face and then leave and then return again until eventually his body becomes more metal than man. There is some kind of subplot of how he came to get this strange desease. Tetsuo and his girlfriend hit some guy who just before cut open his leg and jammed an iron bar into the slit with their car. They take his body out into the forest to hide it i think and then have sex in front of the corpse for a thrill. The guy isn't dead though and somehow he gives tetsuo the desease i think. He comes back to haunt tetsuo as tetsuo turns into a human scrapyard and then attacks him physically in a very strange dual of metalic body morphing near the end of the film.A lot of the movie is stop motion animation mixed with live action actors. It is comparable to Eraserhead in that way but i liked this a lot more than eraserhead. While Eraserhead is really slow and monotunus Iron man moves at a breakneck pace to an awesome industrial music soundtrack. The industrial music is perfect for this film because the film is based on dirty grimy and rusty industrial metal garbage and even the environments are all streamlined industrial parks and monotonous suburbs.The thing i like about this movie is although it is artsy it's the kind of art that's fun to look at. You don't have to be some rich art fag pretending to like weird s to prove that your some kind of an intellectual to like it. I was really entertained by this movie! Unlike the other reviewer I don't think this movie is purposely all fed up for the sake of being artistic. I think the director wanted to make a visual statement about the relationship technology has with our physical lives. More interested in telling a cool sci fi story with fantastic visuals than with coherent dialogue that makes you ponder the universe. I also didn't get the feeling that this movie took itself too seriously. It's actually quite funny at times and that's why i had fun watching it.If you don't like movies that give you no hope in understanding every aspect of the plot don't watch this but if you like WEIRD sci fi stuff that's unlike anything you've seen before than watch this!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have yet to actually meet anyone in Japan named Tetsuo but I would like to. The only two Tetsuo's I remember from my cinematic childhood are both pretty gloomy. One is the fleshy bubblebursthangover Tetsuo who battles Akira in the renowned anime movie that sparked my serious interest in Japanese culture. The other is the main character of TETSUO 1988 who takes the repressed bubble economy psychosis of Japanese salarymen to legendary extremes. This movie is not for the weak of heart nor is it the least bit bright or happy in any way. TETSUO is a dirty rusty movie that will leave your insides scarred for life.To begin with when I watched this videotape several years ago a short film Drum Beat was featured before the movie. It was rather good but I can't remember any of the details. I'm assuming that the director of that film had gone on to make more good stuff. I don't know.However I do know that the director of TETSUO went on to direct a sequel four years later Tetsuo II Body Hammer which was a frustrating disappointment. First of all the sequel is shot in color which instantly places it closer to a cheap Rrated Power Rangers than anything I'd pay money to see. Second of all the sequel is too long and makes too many desperate attempts to link itself to the first installment. If you liked the first TETSUO chances are you'll be largely disappointed by the second.That said I really don't know what to say about the original TETSUO. It has a feverish techno score maximized use of lowbudget corrugated pipes and household wires and an ominous creepiness akin to that traditional Japanese reptilelady with the long neck. With that imagery set in place the concept behind the movie pushes the gutbarrier to new lows. The main character loses his soul and mind and uncontrollably changes into a mechanical monster. TETSUO is artistically convincing in contrast to some of the contrived robot stuff out there and holds your attention long enough to start sparking and gyrating like a mechanized pizza in a cheap microwaveonwheels. And speaking of microwavable pizza this movie isn't too long either.Please watch this movie if you have a chance because one it's unlike anything I've ever seen before or since and two because corporate Japan hasn't really changed at all since this sick movie was brought wheezing and spurting into this world.Do you want to take over the world together?Sure why the hell not.JY".

One is the fleshy bubblebursthangover Tetsuo who battles Akira in the renowned anime movie that sparked my serious interest in Japanese culture. The other is the main character of TETSUO 1988 who takes the repressed bubble economy psychosis of Japanese salarymen to legendary extremes.

	schema:reviewBody "Tetsuo the Iron Man is among the strangest independent films I have ever seen. It isn't just because of the low budget black and white cinematography but the storyone that is incredibly strange brutal and surreal. The film is packed with blood violence and is one best not to watch if you don't have a very high tolerance for this sort of stuffand my bet is that this includes most people! You certainly wouldn't want to show this to Granny unless you were trying to kill her or your kids unless you want to turn them into psychopaths! The story is very choppy has very little dialog and often seems to be missing a clear storyline. It begins with some freaky guy living among metallic junkand he's shoving pieces of metal into his body! It's pretty hardcore stuffcomplete with blood guts and maggots! Soon he's run over in an accident that cost nothing to stagebecause they don't show the accident in order to save money. Next a man is talking to his girlfriend on the phone about the incident and tells her he's feeling strange since the hit and run. Following this the guy has a LONG surreal hallucination about a woman who is made up of flesh and metalas he too is becoming metal. She torments him for a long time becomes a monster and rapes him brutally. Then he wakes up to find that while it was a hallucination he still is having metal erupt from his body. He and his girlfriend then make out like monkeys. All this only in the first 20 minutes of the film!! I haven't even gotten to the portion where he has a giant spinning metal screw for genitals!! Need I go on?! I really don't think so.The bottom line is that this is a film with almost no audience. Unless you love indie horror Japanese films extreme violence sexual sadism AND surrealism then you'll probably find the whole thing rather repellent. Believe it or not actually found the film a bit boring after a while because it was so excessive there really couldn't be anything else to offend or surprise me after a while.".

The themes of bodily invasion explored best by the likes of David Cronenberg and John Carpenter are pushed to their wild extreme and ridiculous limits here. The early stages as the salary man begins to peel away skin from all over his body to reveal strange new appendages makes Jeff Goldblum vomiting over his food look tame which is no easy task. The one scene that climaxes in the salary man asking his girlfriend the somewhat hysterical line 'do you want to taste my sewage pipe' has to be one of the most bizarre I've ever seen. To be honest after he has made his full transformation into The Iron Man he looks like he was assembled on Blue Peter but the skill of the director means this common problem for low budget films is a minor one here.With an high levels of gore frenetic camerawork and dizzying chase sequences it goes without saying that Tetsuo is not something for the light hearted.

Sadly no.Less a film more a series of disjointed random images Tetsuo is Doctor Who's Cybermen for art students. Some of the images are striking and stunningly filmed in black and white but this is more the masturbatory offering of a directorial undergraduate than a film for public consumption.Vague story seems to revolve around Tomoroh Taguchi feeling emasculated by his girlfriend and imagining that emasculation in terms of industrialisation. His girlfriend suggestively eats a sausage but it does him no good  all he can hear is a scraping metal sound whenever she takes a bite. He also has what appears to be a dream whereby she rapes him with a giant plug extension sprouting from her crotch  now there's penis envy for you! Mind you Taguchi certainly knows how to fight back  he grows a drill for a John Thomas and tries to rape her to death with a translated You want a taste of my sewage pipe?

Sadly no.Less a film more a series of disjointed random images Tetsuo is Doctor Who's Cybermen for art students. Some of the images are striking and stunningly filmed in black and white but this is more the masturbatory offering of a directorial undergraduate than a film for public consumption.Vague story seems to revolve around Tomoroh Taguchi feeling emasculated by his girlfriend and imagining that emasculation in terms of industrialisation. His girlfriend suggestively eats a sausage but it does him no good  all he can hear is a scraping metal sound whenever she takes a bite. He also has what appears to be a dream whereby she rapes him with a giant plug extension sprouting from her crotch  now there's penis envy for you! Mind you Taguchi certainly knows how to fight back  he grows a drill for a John Thomas and tries to rape her to death with a translated You want a taste of my sewage pipe?

	schema:reviewBody "Tetsuo The Iron Man was shot with practically no budget with a lot of dedication with a lot of hard work and with a lot of talent. Tetsuo The Iron Man is the brainchild of Japanese film director Shinya Tsukamoto and it is a brilliant piece of industrial cinema. 60 or so minutes of mind blowing psychedelic images moving at 200 miles an hour it is violent and it is disturbing and it is like nothing you've ever seen before.There is a man obsessed with metal to the point that he insert various metallic parts on his body. There is another man an average guy a salaryman he has a girlfriend and a small apartment. He's a nobody who's about to become a somebody or rather a something when he hits the metal fetishist while driving along with his girlfriend. The two dump the body in a nearby forest then they have sex just a few meters away from the man they thought they killed. The fetishist survives of course and plots his revenge. Soon after the salaryman begins to notice strange changes to his body. Metal starts to grow all over his body slowly consuming his flesh while at the same time fending of the metal fetishist who uses mechanical parasites to take control of people to attack our slowlyturningintoamanofiron protagonist. This of course all leads to a oneonone confrontation between the two and a bizarre but extremely satisfying ending.Tetsuo is really the essence of Tsukamoto's cinema. It's a demonstration of his trademark style that he uses in various degrees in his latter films. Shot entirely in black and white with most of the time using handheld camera Tsukamoto keeps you up close and personal with all the carnage going on screen. It's hyper kinetic punchyouintheteeth narrative doesn't rely on dialogue but on action to tell the story. Visual metaphors play an extremely strong part in understanding the underlying message of the film. The themes of  man becoming machine man becoming more and more dependent to machines is beautifully explained through the disturbing special effects stop motion animation really really awesome make up through characters or simply through the Japanese industrial landscape. The presence of the sexual element in the film is crucial as it sets the tone for the final confrontation where it becomes obvious that this really isn't about revenge or anything of the sort it's about this strange relationship between two menmachines. Call it a love story if you would.The soundtrack composed by Chu Ishikawa is a perfect match for Tetsuo. Raw violent and destructive industrial music comes together with a raw violent and destructive industrial movie to the point you can't really separate the two. You can't listen to the OST without Tetsuo and you can't watch Tetsuo without OST.Final verdict. This isn't something you watch while drinking beer or eating popcorn or whatever. It's not exactly what you call a comfortable movie and definitely not for the squeamish. Nevertheless as clichd as it sounds it is like nothing you've ever seen and in my opinion it is a cinematic masterpiece.".

Tetsuo is a wild series of raw and nightmarish footage roughly edited together and guided by an industrialhardcore music soundtrack. The cinematography is in eerie black and white the sound effects are earsplitting and often unrecognizable and the lowbudget special effects are shocking. All these elements plus of course the insane plot of men turning into aggressive metal machines make Tetsuo a truly ugly yet fascinating cult gem. I have no idea how to properly describe this movie...I suppose it are writerdirectorprotagonist Shinya Tsukamoto's personal fantasies of sexual perversion and sadistic violence but obviously influenced by typically Japanse types of entertainment like magnacomics and Godzilla monstermovies.

I came in the movie with huge expectations and hopeful that it would turn out great. I have to say I was impressed my expectations were not only met but they were blown away. The Social Network easily rivals Fincher's previous works like Fight Club or Se7en.Aesthetically the film is very beautiful its very Fincher. It has a very perversely attractive appeal a glimmering awfulness as it was lit from within. David Fincher deserves an Oscar for Best Director he is extremely underrated by the Academy. Hopefully this film will finally bring Fincher in a new light.The actors did an amazing job they should all be recognized for their work in this movie. Jesse Eisenberg did an amazing job playing Mark Zuckerberg. Hopefully he will not be known as the next Michael Cera anymore. With this film he established himself as a serious actor and he will have a bright future ahead of him. Andrew Garfield also did an amazing job as the cofounder of Facebook and the best friend of Zuckerberg. He deserves an Oscar nom and I hope we'll be seeing more of him in the future. The rest of the cast did a fine job and also hoping seeing them in the future.I recommend this movie to everyone it deals with betrayal and greed. The movie definitely deserves an Academy award for Best Picture. It is extremely revalent for our times and many years to come. I consider this movie is a fine piece of modern filmmaking and probably will be considered as a classic in the future. So if you're not doing anything tonight you should spent an evening in theaters to watch The Social Network.".

He's made a film about facebook?!Almost immediately 'Social Network' became a movie that I needed to see. David Fincher is one of the true masters of delivering some of the greatest films of the past few decades. The gritty 'Se7en' and the intelligent 'Fight Club' had been two of my favourite movies growing up the latter of which I had the privilege of studying in college quite in depth and although I missed 'Benjamin Button' only god knows why it took me until 2013 to watch! I had thoroughly enjoyed the enigmatic 'Zodiac' as well.'Social Network' became my favourite Fincher title almost immediately. It is one of those rare works that feels so effortless in its brilliance which is due to the incredible work from both Fincher and Sorkin in creating this modern masterpiece the way I see it the film relies heavily upon three aspects which are executed with perfection.First of all the score for this film is sensational. I've always been a huge fan of Trent Reznor  Nine Inch Nails but with his partnership with Atticus Ross and his ongoing collaborations with Fincher also see 'Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' I can only see them becoming the most formidable artists in the industry every minor note resonates perfectly throughout the film and creates a beautiful texture on top of an already excellent piece of work.Secondly Sorkin's razor sharp screenplay is something a director can only dream of receiving the dialogue never falters and it is always witty sincere and hilarious all in one which can also be attributed to the performances of the actors involvedBut most of all the atmosphere that Fincher is able to create visually is stunning huge credit must also go to long time collaborator Jeff Cronenweth together their formidable partnership and undoubted perfect understanding of each other's work is clearly the factor behind this film being one of the best movies of the past decadeGreat performances from Eisenberg Garfield and Timberlake also help this movie stand head and shoulders above most and as one of the most promising young actresses in the business Rooney Mara is given her first chance to truly show her quality in a small role.It's difficult to say where 'Social Network' will stand when we look back on Finchers body of work but one things for sure if it isn't seen as one of his truly great masterpieces then he is sure to become one of if not the most powerful director in the industry for years to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow seriously last year I thought I was robbed because I didn't get to see The Social Network in the theater. The way some users were describing this film as the defining movie of our generation I thought I was missing the next Godfather. I was trying to wait to buy the film on preview over at Blockbuster because again with the hype I assumed I would probably love the film but I caught it on a movie channel this morning and have to say while it's definitely a good movie I really hope this isn't the defining movie of my generation. The Social Network is loosely based on the rise of Facebook the world's most popular website and IMO the fall of society. I'm sure it had good intentions in the first place as it was awesome to keep in touch with my college friends back in 2004 but it's gone down hill since then. But to the movie's credit we are blessed with some pretty good actors fast editing and a really interesting story. I think that's what really saved this movie from being just another addition to this hot trend.In 2003 Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend. He returns to his dorm drunk and writes a scathing blog entry about her. This inspires him to create an oncampus website called Facemash which allows users to rate the attractiveness of female students using photographs pilfered from various university systems. FaceMash's popularity and the fact that Mark created it in one night while drunk brings him to the attention of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra. Mark approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin and tells him of his idea for what he calls The facebook an online social networking website exclusive to Harvard University students. Eduardo agrees to help Mark providing 1000 to help start the site. Starting the rise and rise of the popular social network site Facebook.Jesse Eisenberg as Mark I thought was what really stepped the film back from being a perfect film he's a good actor but doesn't have the charisma to make Mark likable and talked way too fast for average movie goers to understand half of what's going on. That does damage in reviews because if people understood it they automatically mark that as they are intelligent not to go onto that rant but just a pet peeve of mine. I read The Accidental Billionaires and Mark seems like a very nice guy who wanted to create something very good and seems like a pleasure to meet in real life. Jesse plays him off too much as a shy nerdy jerk who's just too greedy at times. Justin Timberlake playing Sean Parker he's good enough he seems to really enjoy playing what I would assume Sean to be like since he almost took down the music industry in the 90's. Justin plays him cool and really proved to that he can both talents in the music and acting industry.Is The Social Network the best film of 2010? Depends on your taste my favorite contender is still The Black Swan. However this film does deserve it's praise mainly for David Finch and his vision. His fast pace with the film was what kept it going and his passion for the story was what really grabbed me. Though I know not to take this for a biography I don't see why they couldn't stay a little more true to the story though from what I understand Mark is a very private manironic. I would recommend The Social Network it will be apart of film history to describe our era in computers however I don't think it's our generation's defining film as many have described. Just don't believe the hype I found it good just to watch it once.710".

	onyx:emotionText "Wow seriously last year I thought I was robbed because I didn't get to see The Social Network in the theater. The way some users were describing this film as the defining movie of our generation I thought I was missing the next Godfather. I was trying to wait to buy the film on preview over at Blockbuster because again with the hype I assumed I would probably love the film but I caught it on a movie channel this morning and have to say while it's definitely a good movie I really hope this isn't the defining movie of my generation. The Social Network is loosely based on the rise of Facebook the world's most popular website and IMO the fall of society.

	schema:headline " A timeless story of friendship loyalty greed and betrayal";
	schema:reviewBody "I just want to get this out there right away and put the cards on the table so to speak When I first heard about it I had very little faith in this project. I was stupefied confused by the thought of what attracted all this talent to this seemingly trivial story to begin with? Why would David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin possibly be interested in the story of the founding of Facebook? Surely they could have found something more important more meaningful to apply their efforts to. After seeing the film though I realized that of course Fincher and Sorkin knew what they were doing all along. And furthermore that labeling this as The Facebook movie is really an insult to what Sorkin and Fincher were trying to and have succeeded in achieving with this film.First and foremost I have to take a step back and admire this film as a technical achievement. Despite seeming to be a departure for Fincher in terms of content and subject matter  which it is and then again isn't  the film is very clearly and undeniably a Fincher film. Reteaming with his Fight Club director of photography Jeff Cronenweth Fincher manages to create and capture that really unique look all of his films have. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous  once again Fincher proves that he is probably getting the best results in digital photography out of any other director working in that medium and this film shot on the RED One camera looks absolutely beautiful from the framing to the camera movement to the lighting and on to the look and the feel of the depth of field the RED captures.Sorkin's script is also an impeccable achievement and showcases once again just what a genius this man really is. From a structural standpoint it employs a very effective use of a framing device  the Zuckerberg lawsuit depositions which introduce the various characters and lead into flashbacks of the events being discussed. It really lends the film a Rashomon air and intensifies the mystery behind the Zuckerberg character and what exactly transpired in the creation of this phenomenon Facebook. Sorkin also demonstrates an acute awareness of character construction and manages to create a loathsome protagonist we hate and are frustrated by but yet we still end up sympathizing with. Most of all though it's a showcase of Sorkin's impeccable writing style and knack for writing dialogue with a very unique sound and rhythm. I saw Fincher refer to it as Sorkinese in an interview and this is a really good description  it is certainly very unique to Sorkin and the scripts he has written and it is also certainly a completely unique language  one which normal people in our real world do not speak but that just sounds great on screen. The rapidfire overlapping dialogue remains one of the highlights of the film for me and the script is certainly a shooin for Oscar consideration.The film is also a rare showcase of pure acting prowess and features a very interesting and eclectic cast of young actors stepping out of their comfort zones and delivering some truly phenomenal work. The casting of the film is quite a departure for Fincher who has enough clout to gather the biggest names working in the business. Instead he opted to go for a cast of relative unknowns or upandcomers and really make stars out of them. First and foremost to be mentioned is Jesse Eisenberg an actor I have personally been a fan of since The Squid and the Whale in 2005 and one whose work I have continued to enjoy since then. However no matter how good he was in those previous films none of his previous performances compare to his amazing achievement on this film. Stripping away his signature goofiness and neurosis Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a cold calculated and determined genius who knows what he wants is very confident and forwardlooking and will stop at nothing to get it. His counter in the film is Saverin played brilliantly by Andrew Garfield a name we will be hearing a lot more of of in the next few years Saverin is a far more sympathetic character more warm and inviting  these traits only increase the impact of the tragedy of Zuckerberg's betrayal of their friendship.Many pundits and commentators have designated this to be the film that defines our generation and truly a product of its time in the most literal sense of the word. However I'm not sure I like this designation especially since once you watch the film you very quickly realize that this isn't a story about the founding of Facebook it's really a story of friendship ambition and betrayal a character study of this fascinating individual whose actions in the film happen to depict the invention of an online social networking site that gets out of hand and puts all of his relationships especially that with his best friend and business partner in jeopardy. All of the themes mentioned above are universal and can be applied to a number of fantastic films and works of fiction over the centuries and that I think is the greatest achievement of the film.".

The writer here does simple clean dialogladen plots for TeeVee.They decided to go for an economical story something that we can walk into with all sorts of questions about the world and how it is changing and come out believing we understand it.The facts are intimidating. Soon Facebook will have a billion users. It is already the most visited site in history. As an entity it already is on par with the the top tier tech companies Apple and Google. But far beyond that far far more significant is the way that the world is changing. Until now friendship was absolutely anchored in physical proximity. All media allowed that to be extended but only if it were well established by actually being together.Now this notion is being replaced by an entire generation. The compact is no longer on mutual support and emotional needs but simply being paid attention to. Life is flattened while the numbers get larger. Shared abstract thinking is reduced to whether something is liked or not. Political movements exploit this and we are getting into trouble faster than we can imagine. So we enter a theater with a film about this phenomenon with dire worries. Social networking is the successor to TeeVee as the next possible disaster in the social experiment.The filmmaker and writer decided to make a movie about this simplification of the social fabric by taking a story that is necessarily rich and human and reduce it to a cartoon. We liked it not because the thing is well crafted though it is. We embrace it because it explains things. In fact it simplifies things so much that we can feel superior in knowing that we would have made a slightly more rich version.The story presented here is no secret emotionally weak geek type Jew Harvard undergrad has trouble making friends. Each of these three stereotypes is exploited shamelessly in the service of an unambiguous narrative. This guy will do anything to make friends and elevate his social standing. But the only thing he can do is program so he finds what he needs in a website he creates. There is a clear calculus of sacrificing real friends for virtual standing. It is not something he can do because he understands people it is something he has to do because he doesn't.Turns out is what others need is similar so the thing takes off. Advisors investors and lawyers surround the thing. Simple. Our hero ends up alone. The story marginalizes women as a necessity deliberately allowing us to see them as Zuck does. More stereotypes.But what has been done here is a type of narrative fold. The subject is the flattening of the human relationship to the trivial. The movie itself is the similar flattening of the story to the trivial. It is what it shows and implicitly criticizes. We walk out understanding in that way we do after a political rally before we actually start thinking and seeing real people.In the real world what is interesting is not what happened with a girlfriend or some jock twins. What matters is the way that connection is changing the way we form associations and indeed what an association means and what value it gives. This is not a fad. Facebook and Twitter may fade but something profound has started perhaps changing the very nature of what it means to invest in societies. We likely are not yet past a tipping point in government and family units but it is likely that we are well past the tipping point in narratives. We may never get richness back as a basic value. It will be relegated to a few who form a social network.It is also interesting that Zukerberg Dorsey Canter Mullenweg and Winer truly believe that what they are about amplifies life in all its dimensions. They believe they are doing good work. If this film is anything it is evidence that the contrary is true.And Zuck isn't cool enough to be an Emacs user any more though he seems to have a genius in the opposite direction finding the lowest common scalable need.Written from the Starbucks two blocks from the original Facebook office.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

	schema:headline " It really shouldn't work";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a film which simply shouldn't work but it does  magnificently. A story centred on a teenager who becomes the world's youngest billionaire a web site that reaches a million users in two years and a cast of real life characters with names like Zuckerberg and Winklevoss just shouldn't be possible. A convoluted tale of raw conflict on the origins of a new type of web site should not lend itself to an expensive movie as opposed to a television documentary. It succeeds because it is not about the technology but about creativity and conflict and about friendship and betrayal. It succeeds because of a magical combination of accomplished direction scintillating dialogue and superb acting.The direction comes from David Fincher who has had variable success all the way from Alien 3 to Se7en but here he is right on form with a flashy but tightly structured presentation that never fails to command your attention and interest. The allimportant sparkling script is courtesy of Aaron Sorkin who gave us The West Wing  the best television series ever  and yet apparently does not do social networking.At the heart of the movie is a brilliant Oscarworthy performance from Jesse Eisenberg as the 19 year old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg the genius behind The Facebook the social network the unsympathetic antihero of the adventure a borderline sociopath variously described by women characters as an asshole and someone just trying so hard to be one. Andrew Garfield is excellent as Zuckerberg's Harvard roommate and cofounder of the site Eduardo Savarin thanks to the wonders of CGI Arnie Hammer manages to be terrific as both the twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss while singer Justin Timberlake is a revelation as the Napster founder Sean Parker. This is a testosteronecharged fable with room for women only in minor support roles  ironic in that getting girls was the impetus for the Facebook project.The film opens in 2003 with a breathlessly wordy encounter and closes in 2009 with a poignantly wordless scene. In between the story zips along at the frenetic pace characterised by the business itself. Adapted from Ben Mezrich's book The Accidental Millionaires the framework for the fascinating narrative is not one but two courtroom dramas or to be more accurate pretrial hearings both resulted in outofcourt settlements which tells you a lot. Clearly you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.".

A story centred on a teenager who becomes the world's youngest billionaire a web site that reaches a million users in two years and a cast of real life characters with names like Zuckerberg and Winklevoss just shouldn't be possible. A convoluted tale of raw conflict on the origins of a new type of web site should not lend itself to an expensive movie as opposed to a television documentary.

	schema:reviewBody "The Social Network is contrived artificial and overlong but it didn't have to be. There were the makings of a really absorbing movie using the very timeless themes of betrayal and greed however those opportunities were repeatedly squandered. The dialogue was characteristic of Sorkin with the actors continually speaking over each other spouting bon mots that rang hollow because they had no time to register. When a simple statement with a few words would suffice and be much more powerful Sorkin stuffed in multiple sentences that rendered the scene lifeless. Sometimes silence is the most powerful indicator of feeling. The most glaring problem is the absolute implausibility of one of the central motifs of the story which is Zuckerberg's obsession with final clubs. The references are hilariously outdated and irrelevant coming from right out of the 60s. Does anyone really believe that Zuckerberg would screw his cofounder out of his share of the company because of resentment over the fact that Eduardo was chosen for one of the clubs? Whatever happened to plain and simple greed? Surely there was a more interesting and more credible way to explain why the partnership went sour. The filmmakers should have found it. It has been well publicized that the film is largely fictional most of the machinations described in the film never happened or didn't happen as portrayed. Both the director and screenwriter have admitted that they don't know much about Facebook or see the point of it. Sorkin himself also said that he was willing to sacrifice the truth for a good story. That isn't necessarily a problem if the storytelling is solid the stretching of facts can be overlooked. In this case the plot is overwrought and not believable making the glaring plot holes and lack of veracity prominent. A few more quibbles the soundtrack was incredibly intrusive the portrayal of all the women in the film was shameful and sexist and the vision of life at Harvard was inauthentic. I thought the main actors did a fair job with the material they were given especially Jesse Eisenberg who managed to give Zuckerberg more than one dimension. But the movie could have been so much more which makes the final result really depressing.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is something wrong with this film like it was put though a filter of some type to remove any real humanity unless that is the point. I'm not a psychiatrist but Mark Zuckerberg as portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg in the film seems to suffer from some kind of emotional agnosia. . .and so does the film.I was looking forward to this film and I had fun watching it but as I thought about it afterwards all I could remember were the squandered opportunities the film had to actually tell a moving story about friendship and loyalty that got wrecked by a cool business venture that became much too successful way too quickly. Both Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher have both said The Social Network is not really about the Facebook saga with Sorkin even being so bold as to claim the basic story goes all the way back to the Greek dramatists. He has a point so what do you think would Aristophanes have been a MAC man or a PC user? Truly you won't find a better emotional core to build a drama around than the relationship between best friends Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg and Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield. That bromance is the heart of The Social Network and the film kept getting close to this emotional territory but then it would crash like an overloaded network and flit to other characters not important to the main story.For example the machinations of the Winklevoss twins are comic relief elevated to main story arc status. The selfrighteous anger they feel and the lengths they go to seek revenge play like Margaret Dumont fighting with Groucho Marx.It's very satisfying to see these overly entitled great white hopes become dismayingly angry that things didn't go exactly the way they wanted them to for probably the first time in their lives. The Social Network develops a sharp edge to it in these scenes from their characters genuine feelings of an entitlement snatched away from them by a clearly undeserving cretin and the actors play it for all the high comedy they can. But the main bromance is tested when the sexy charming persuasive entrepreneur Sean Parker played to paranoid perfection by Justin Timberlake comes in well over an hour into the film and starts finding ways to turn Facebook into a megamoney making operation all the while charming the pants off Mark Zuckerberg much to Eduardo's sad eyed jealousy. At this moment The Social Network could become an ancient Greek drama in more ways than one. But it doesn't. Instead we just get more back and forth cutting between depositions and lawyer meetings which are interesting and could have provided clues into the characters but don't. These scenes were the biggest missed opportunities in the film. Another squandered moment why can't we see the scene where Zuckerberg goes into an investment banker's office in his bathrobe and slippers to deliver a Sean Parker birdflip? Will Zuckerberg realize that making good on revenge for others is totally unsatisfying? And why was the tough talking Parker too big a wuss not to do it himself? If the scene isn't going to advance the plot or inform about the characters why have it?Witnessing Parkers pathetic attempt at a put down of Andrew Garfield by offering him a check for 19000 and then totally being made a fool of showed exactly what kind of man Saverin was and what kind of useless blowhard Parker was. As a secondary theme the idea that money can ruin almost anything good like friendship loyalty or love even here The Social Network does not convince. It seems that it was the fact that Facebook made tons of money that this story even has an ending that did not end in suicide or death. If Sorkin or Fincher sees anything ironic or even noteworthy in this they sure don't indicate it in the film. Remember people would even have excused a horrible sociopathic bully like Alex DeLage in A Clockwork Orange if he had only made a billion dollars for someone. As it is right now The Social Network feels way too long and there is no emotional payoff. I didn't feel a sense of relief or fun or even sadness when the end credit titles listed what happened to the various characters. The Social Network had glibness and a flow that only indicated a surface look at the deeper themes but nothing else. Fincher generally likes to make fast moving films because he seems to fear depth. He probably disagrees with the saying that still waters run deep and thinks that still waters are the ones that turn stagnant. Well David that's true but stagnant water can still be deep water and shallow water is never anything else.".

I was fortunate enough to see The Social Network at a screening on 91610 for my college. Eisenberg Hammer and Sorkin were there and did a Q and A after the film. It was a GREAT experience. All of them seemed excited about the film and rightfully so. The film brilliantly tells the story of college students who go through hell with each other over the credit for Facebook and the damage that comes to all of them because of it. The acting and dialogue were flawless. Eisenberg Garfield and even Timberlake churn out performances that should get them serious attention come award time. Fincher's direction is also perfect. you can always tell a Fincher film when you see it because his visual style is so striking and The Social Network is no exception. When this is released please go see it and watch a film that defines a generation and what the world has become.".

The film deals with the suit filed by others against Zuckerberg and his chums for allegedly stealing the facebook idea for himself.There are the many foolish college life scenes still depicted in the film.The film starts with Eisenberg talking a mile a minute on a date. It is only when he meets up with the Justin Timberlake character that he becoming a maneuvering character. The film shows some accurate traditional problems of corporate management. The problem of Eduardo is dealt with in the way you generally expect such problems to be handled.The film is not even in the class of this year's superb The King's Speech.".

It showed us an irresistible adrenalin junkie which  I'm told  the real life Ralston was anything but. Real life engineers are rarely held as gifts of god to women something that James Franco's character undoubtedly is by hardly anyone bar engineers themselves.And sure enough coders have it even worse.

But Facebook did change the way that millions of people now choose to interact with each other not that I'd be personally thrilled about it.ZuckerbergFacebook just got a couple of things right from the getgo. E.g. no ads wait until they're hooked making it exclusive total selfimage management and making sure the service is never ever down. That combined with the connections he apparently got from the Napster guy and it was pretty much a waiting game from there.It's hard to get worked up over something that seemingly required no real effortpains on Zuckerberg's part to make Facebook an instant local and later global phenomenon. There's never a feeling that things even could backfire. I'm sure this is not the case but that's the feel we get.Plus the grand idea behind Facebook didn't get any less banal and immature after seeing the movie just another superficial way of making similarminded friends while helping to score some. It was maybe more elitist than other services so why am I not impressed?I can appreciate Zuckerberg for his seemingly natural talent with programming. Brilliant minds like that make my life more easier than harder we can always optout while they get to do what they love doing the most.But in no way do I feel indebted to this guy or feel he's responsible for starting something new that will change our lives forever. Far from it. If anything I feel his contraption has only progressed the regression of genuine human interaction.Too bad that most people have less than stellar interest on guys and gals who happen to share his level of talents in any particular field. Sure nearandreal geniuses might all have an affable persona underneath the cold outer surface andor any number of other good qualities but if they  like Zuckerberg presented here  never let anybody see that side of them how could they blame anyone but themselves when accused of being aholes?Usually one has to give people a genuine reason  or better yet reasons  for them to even consider a possibility of falling in love with you to be understood in a very broad sense. I'm sure Zuckerberg  like most of us  can love can be loved and is in fact loved but that is something we are not allowed to see in the movie except briefly in the last scene I'm guessing.That's an epic fail if one is aiming for a moral story of any caliber. The real Zuckerberg remains a mystery and what's even worse a mystery who does not yet even warrant a biography.But the persona of Zuckerberg is irrelevant anyways. He's just a name. Just a random guy you'd meet in a party and forget the next day. Not someone you'd take an instant interest in  in real life. And unlike a selfmade hero Zuckerberg ultimately comes out as a sad opportunist despite also being gullibleimpressionable who got immensely lucky and whom very few would call a friend. Even if Aaron Ralston was pretty much out of his mind going alone and seriously underprepared canyoneering at least you could cheer for this guy to succeed. Pure American carefree idiotism combined with pure American persistence and will to live. That's an engaging story and a true accomplishment from Boyle. The Social Network was just the first act.We knew Ralston would survive we knew Zuckerberg would become a billionaire. We saw Ralston change but Zuckerberg stayed essentially the same. Where's the film? When Facebook won't be around anymore then a bio might be in order.Jesse Eisenberg plays his caricature character flawlessly though it's just more of the same he did in Roger Dodger which by the way did have something worthwhile going on in it. But like many others I was more impressed with Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. As for the soundtrack I'd be more than content to see the comeback of oldfashioned film score composers who know their place in filmmaking There Will Be Blood  anyone?.BTW. I absolutely resent it when people insist on saying they are drunk when they've in reality just had a few beers. IF you're drunk you don't code. You barely form sentences.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie was good for what it represented and in terms of direction it is a beautiful piece of work as always from David fincher. I can not be clearer it is a well done movie and the cast is stupendous. But i couldn't help but hate everything about our central character of mark zuckerburg and everything that he stands for. What makes it worse is that this is based on true events. So lets recap for a moment...A narcissistic and morally bankrupt mark zuckerburg decides he doesn't stand out enough in life even though he has been admitted into one of the most well known and prestigious academic institutions in the entire western hemisphere. So he decides after a little quibble with his girlfriend he acts like a complete child and puts the rumour mill into full swing in order to avenge is insulted honour by posting humiliating things about his ex girlfriend on the internet. Afterwards he decides to set up a minor internet site that rates the attractiveness of female Harvard students. I'm sure i don't have to mention the shallowness of these actions but I feel I must all the same. Then two twin Harvard athletes decide to ask him to design essentially a myspace for Harvard students and piece by piece from the input of many other people from the school zuckerburg pieces it all together with the help of his colleague Saverin. As they watch their idea flourish and grow the twins decide to take on zuckerburg in a legal battle and also try to insight a breach of Harvard's code of conduct neither of which are upheld for reasons i can't abide. Further on with the help of the dipsh!t who has taught the world how to single handedly destroy the music industry zuckerburg then turns around to cut his friend and first investor Saverin out of his share from 34 to .03. And now after countless legal battles Zuckerburg has become the youngest billionaire in history.So what have we learned...we have learned that society rewards people who are so deluded on their own over inflated self worth like facebooks opening stock price that they steal lie cheat and worst of all betray friends and loved ones for the almighty dollar. Why didn't anyone take care of him when they still could!!! If I was president of Harvard he would have been out on his a the minute he violated the code of conduct and never been permitted to even mop the floors of Harvard university. If no one upholds the code why have it? I sincerely hope this class action lawsuit against Zuckerburg falls through and he loses everything and spends a few miserable years in prison for his alleged insider trading. If he has openly admitted the accuracy of this movie and that he indeed did backstab and cheat his way to the top I have no reason not to believe he wouldn't commit insider trading.".

	onyx:emotionText "The movie was good for what it represented and in terms of direction it is a beautiful piece of work as always from David fincher. I can not be clearer it is a well done movie and the cast is stupendous. But i couldn't help but hate everything about our central character of mark zuckerburg and everything that he stands for. What makes it worse is that this is based on true events. So lets recap for a moment...A narcissistic and morally bankrupt mark zuckerburg decides he doesn't stand out enough in life even though he has been admitted into one of the most well known and prestigious academic institutions in the entire western hemisphere. So he decides after a little quibble with his girlfriend he acts like a complete child and puts the rumour mill into full swing in order to avenge is insulted honour by posting humiliating things about his ex girlfriend on the internet. Afterwards he decides to set up a minor internet site that rates the attractiveness of female Harvard students. I'm sure i don't have to mention the shallowness of these actions but I feel I must all the same. Then two twin Harvard athletes decide to ask him to design essentially a myspace for Harvard students and piece by piece from the input of many other people from the school zuckerburg pieces it all together with the help of his colleague Saverin. As they watch their idea flourish and grow the twins decide to take on zuckerburg in a legal battle and also try to insight a breach of Harvard's code of conduct neither of which are upheld for reasons i can't abide. Further on with the help of the dipsh!t who has taught the world how to single handedly destroy the music industry zuckerburg then turns around to cut his friend and first investor Saverin out of his share from 34 to .03. And now after countless legal battles Zuckerburg has become the youngest billionaire in history.So what have we learned...we have learned that society rewards people who are so deluded on their own over inflated self worth like facebooks opening stock price that they steal lie cheat and worst of all betray friends and loved ones for the almighty dollar. Why didn't anyone take care of him when they still could!!! If I was president of Harvard he would have been out on his a the minute he violated the code of conduct and never been permitted to even mop the floors of Harvard university. If no one upholds the code why have it? I sincerely hope this class action lawsuit against Zuckerburg falls through and he loses everything and spends a few miserable years in prison for his alleged insider trading. If he has openly admitted the accuracy of this movie and that he indeed did backstab and cheat his way to the top I have no reason not to believe he wouldn't commit insider trading.";

AT ALL. People raving about this film are simply fooled by the trite joy that Hey I use Facebook and here are the guys who made it when the film itself is dismal. I was hoping for another Zodiak and refuse to believe David Fincher had anything to do with this bland wreck. It's a film made by rich people about rich people for rich people.All characters are onedimensional with no arc Critics rave of witty dialogue but only three moments offer any you can see them online and save your money. Any potential emotional conflict is COMPLETELY left out most notably sharing in any inward struggle the main character must have had to betray his only friend for no reason. We are given blowjobs and cocaine over character growth and anyone we can relate to.This film demonstrates two trends in Hollywood that in my opinion are destroying cinema first and most importantly is that if a film is based on a true story it need not tell a story well. There are recreation scenes on America's Most Wanted with more character growth than this film. A documentary would be more entertaining because we would not be expecting to sympathize and vicariously bond with any characters.The second destructive trend in Hollywood is pouring advertising money into bad films. It seems the better the film the less advertising money is put in because they know people will love the film for the film. Here we are told from every ad and critic on the planet to love this film before entering the theater and the entire time watching it I sit there are say when is the part I'm supposed to love or even care about. I recognize a few smart lines from the trailer and the audience seemed to smirk at those but even the woman who pretended to be shocked by 22000 hits over 2200 had a sense of boredom and confusion in her gasp that reeked of doubt as to why should I care?

Along the way they create a company that exists solely to collect as much personal data as it can get its grubby hands onand then turn around and sell that data off to the highest corporate bidder.For this Facebook gets praised as a eradefining phenomenon that is supposedly out to invent a wonderful new online world by creating this vast social network.To which I say hogwash. The World Wide Web itself is actually the real great social network. In the end Facebook really adds nothing to the online experience. Some might argue that a Facebook page is easier to set up than a Web site. But this is false. Anyone can easily set up a Web site for free with only a few clicks these daysand in doing so you have freedom from the grubby clutches of Facebook.The problem with Facebook is that it goes against the open nature of the Web that made the latter so successful. Facebook basically wants to control everything. And not for lofty idealistic reasons but simply to rake in billions.The Social Network is idealizing and overhyping a company that is basically extremely overrated. Even revenuewise I'd say Facebook is overratedI'm not at all convinced that its multibillion dollar valuations are going to stand the test of time any more than companies that had ridiculous valuations during the 2001 Dot Com meltdown. And even as a work of fiction The Social Network utterly fails.Maybe it's just me but I simply can't get into a film that has no appealing characters. Nobody in this film has a heart. Nobody seems to care about anyone else but themselves. I couldn't really relate to anyone in the movie. They're all a bunch of privileged elitist kids who believe they are geniuses who tower over the rest of us. In reality the only way they're superior to the rest of us is that they have bigger trust funds or trust funds at all for that matter.Maybe some people enjoy two hours of egotistical jerks scheming about how they're going to control our online lives and sell our personal data off to the highest bidder. But the characters left me ice cold as did the story.Incidentally I know a thing or two about creating successful Web properties myself. I'm a Dot Com entrepreneur who has built a number of highly popular Web sites. And for me The Social Network simply didn't ring true in depicting the grueling hard work that it takes to build a popular Web site.For one thing no one in this film ever seems to break a sweat. Success for the characters seems to come effortlessly. The film does a poor job of depicting the brutal marathon 20hour days that one must put in to build a popular Web site. When I built my sites I didn't spend loads of time as the characters in this movie do at fancy bars and nightclubs sipping 20 martinis. The reality is a lot less glamorous.In truth you simply spend endless hours hunched over a computer monitor doing tedious often repetitive work trying to find the spark that will make your site a success. Oh and unlike the privileged pampered site creators in this movie most popular Web site builders including myself also worked at fulltime day jobs as we built our Web sites. Life wasn't an endless series of parties as it appears to be for the characters in this film.For me The Social Network simply didn't ring true. It's an overrated film about an overrated company.".

My opinion is these people are so caught up in their 'psychological conditioniong' they find it difficult to comprehend so much information which totally rejects what they are used to reading and seeing in the commercial news daily. And they often use language which is difficult for the normal person to understand. Its complete intellectual materialism. These people may boast thorough university educations but there's no way you can absorb all the information in 'ZI' and 'ZII' in one viewing. It requires multiple viewings which are extermely rewarding.Having studied film at university I personally think Zeitgeist and Zeitgeist Addendum are more important than any other form of media ever produced. By that I mean any film or television show created. Peter Joseph is a Messiah of the 21st Century as he has clearly spent a lot of his own personal time to spread the real message of truth to the people. He doesn't do it for profit or reward but simply to inform the people. Kudos".

Peter Joseph is a Messiah of the 21st Century as he has clearly spent a lot of his own personal time to spread the real message of truth to the people. He doesn't do it for profit or reward but simply to inform the people. Kudos";

	schema:reviewBody "This masterpiece although it hasn't mentioned nearly enough about the motivation of money  it's effects on people beside the idea that money is the same as debt offers us so much information to what's really going on that when you see it the 1st time it will probably blow your mind. After you get passed the fact that you are astonished by the information that is given to you on a silver platter you will begin to give a lot of credit to Joseph Peter and I for one really believe in such a future as the one mentioned in the Venus Project. I am 20 years old of age and I started college approximately 1 year ago. The reason I'm mentioning my age  the fact that I'm in college is because this documentary made me feel proud of myself for not choosing to go to a MilitaryPolice Academy respectively because of this documentary I am now even more proud that I didn't choose to study Economics or Politics and that I decided on studying Electronics Engineering. Technology is the wave of the future  money is the root of all evil things for that matter basically this is what Zeitgeist Addendum is all about. Technology can provide money is just a front a means of oppression. The sooner everybody will find this out the better for our future generations that is if money won't mean the end of everything... This documentary in my opinion also focuses on hope for a better future. I'm really happy to know that there are people out there who really believe in a brighter tomorrow in a world like the Venus Project where routine jobs will be extinct  where most importantly I quote a phrase from the Zeitgeist no one will be left behind. Kinda brings tears to your eyes when you think about how things are  how things should be... doesn't it.".

Omar Torrijos was killed by the CIA. Back in 1981 I had read the socalled Santa Fe Document which I believe was a report created for Ronald Reagan who had already been chosen as the next US president by the plutocrats a text that also gave solutions as killing leaders attracting talents via scholarships or overthrowing governments so I was not much surprised whenever a Latin American leader died. They were being killed like flies. I remember quite vividly the day Torrijos died and how I thought They did it! So this documentary was very revealing in that sense and touching indeed. It does give enough information for one to make personal conclusions based on what we already knew in case one reads alternative info instead of listening to news from CNN Fox etc. with Jacque Fresco adding a funny dimension John Perkins playing the prodigal s.o.b and J. Krishnamurti as the prototypical guru even when he claims that there are no gurus but our own reasoning. The documentary adheres to a movement and that is its main short coming but in the end that is what inspired the previous exposition. One may believe or not on the Venus Project but that does not matter what lies beneath the reasoning behind many of its proposals are true more often than not. Cynic rejection without further analysis without admitting that in the end what we do is to protect our little privileges will not last forever. Recommended.".

We learn that the financial system is basically a pyramid scheme that has taken place over the last 100 years and it is about to crash no bail out will save them.What's good about this film is that it offers a solution...the Venus Project....and a Resource based economy this system of society is beyond Utopia beyond communism a technologically advanced society where the survival of humanity is the inspiration.

We have so much more potential as human beings than working on a shipping doc to buy cigarettes so some fat cat can eat lobster....in the new world we will be exploring space and knowledge will be far more valuable that money.Like the first this movie is free...please search for it on line and enjoy.".

Remember Revenues  minus Costs  Profit roughly.I have no intention of reviewing it it is not a movie like another its purpose is not to entertain or to transpose messages through known cinematic patters.The movie is free meant to be spread and the messages in it are clear there are no metaphors comparisons or anything alike To the point then of my movie commentThis movie clearly intents to reshape the thinking process of intelligent human beings. Instead of absorbing the education and the values we are given as real trustworthy and natural and then merely registering them we should start to question the education question the values of society doubt them check on them and only then decide if information is trustworthy or not reject what is in doubt until there is absolute certainty about the trustworthiness.In my opinion this movie should also be questioned doubted. This is exactly why I said that the movie is for intelligent people after watching this movie they change their thinking process and immediately start to doubt the monetary system but also the movie and the Venus Project.It takes intelligent people to understand what this movie wants and about what it is and it is crucial to understand first. With watching the movie the job is still not done one should start researching on their own with any tools given if things are really that bad in and with the monetary system. We need to ask ourselves a thing or two were the obvious long term consequences of the monetary system intended? Is the Venus Project socially possible? Haven't we gone too far already? There is no correct answer to such questions the answers are arbitrary the solutions are created by everyone. This tears us apart.I personally find the Venus Project very appealing but I see many problems already.First of all it is very idealistic since the values we're given from the monetary system are so strongly inherent in our nature. Could you possibly imagine a world without money? Doing work to live on a good standard that everyone has. Maybe so. Maybe not.There would be no competition then would there? The technologies presented in the movie to harvest clean energy from natural inexhaustible sources are brilliant but I don't think for any second that the one who comes up with it would not ask for money. For profit. To distinguish himself from the others. to compete.This leads me to the second point the Venus Project asks us to lay down competition. However isn't it competition and the thrive for profit that makes us evolute? Are newer and better Computers really produced to make us evolute or is evolution just a side effect of the rush for profit? The latter I would say.It is competition that makes some of us study in the best universities to get better jobs to earn more money and the side effect might really be some evolution. I don't think humanity and its instinctual nature would ever be ready to work to evolute instead to compete. As long as the human being is instinctively driven by competition there will never be a Venus Project.Reason on the highest scale and depth is what could bring the Venus Project to life refusing to compete refusing to get profits at any cost refusing a strong elite position refusing to value money.We would need to value life. Compassion. Solidarity. Impossible? No.But it needs time and work some processing too. The human mind needs to be reshaped education needs to change societal values need dramatic change as well. Just as the movie points out tradition values need to be flushed away but this cannot happen over days or years.I am sure that it will be reality someday. I am also sure that this process of changing values will take a lot of time I'm thinking about hundreds of years or when we run out of oil. We need to be forced to changed preferably by nature.Until that happens a world where there is no money no unemployment no competition no differentiation between a Ferrari and a Ford and technology for everybody such a world will remain a kids fantasy. I had that fantasy too this idea.But what would be a world where everybody has everything for nothing? It would be a world where the new values are love family fun. Which raises new competition who gets the better family the prettier wifehusband...... right now as intelligent as I might be I say We live in a vicious circle of competition. Money is not the problem competition is. As a conclusion I think that a world without competition would free us all and yet leave us with nothing. I hope that hundreds of years after me there will be a near perfect world.Probably without us we are not made for such a world.Thanks if you read this to the end ".

This tears us apart.I personally find the Venus Project very appealing but I see many problems already.First of all it is very idealistic since the values we're given from the monetary system are so strongly inherent in our nature. Could you possibly imagine a world without money? Doing work to live on a good standard that everyone has. Maybe so. Maybe not.There would be no competition then would there? The technologies presented in the movie to harvest clean energy from natural inexhaustible sources are brilliant but I don't think for any second that the one who comes up with it would not ask for money. For profit. To distinguish himself from the others. to compete.This leads me to the second point the Venus Project asks us to lay down competition. However isn't it competition and the thrive for profit that makes us evolute? Are newer and better Computers really produced to make us evolute or is evolution just a side effect of the rush for profit? The latter I would say.It is competition that makes some of us study in the best universities to get better jobs to earn more money and the side effect might really be some evolution. I don't think humanity and its instinctual nature would ever be ready to work to evolute instead to compete. As long as the human being is instinctively driven by competition there will never be a Venus Project.Reason on the highest scale and depth is what could bring the Venus Project to life refusing to compete refusing to get profits at any cost refusing a strong elite position refusing to value money.We would need to value life. Compassion. Solidarity. Impossible? No.But it needs time and work some processing too. The human mind needs to be reshaped education needs to change societal values need dramatic change as well. Just as the movie points out tradition values need to be flushed away but this cannot happen over days or years.I am sure that it will be reality someday. I am also sure that this process of changing values will take a lot of time I'm thinking about hundreds of years or when we run out of oil. We need to be forced to changed preferably by nature.Until that happens a world where there is no money no unemployment no competition no differentiation between a Ferrari and a Ford and technology for everybody such a world will remain a kids fantasy. I had that fantasy too this idea.But what would be a world where everybody has everything for nothing? It would be a world where the new values are love family fun. Which raises new competition who gets the better family the prettier wifehusband...... right now as intelligent as I might be I say We live in a vicious circle of competition. Money is not the problem competition is. As a conclusion I think that a world without competition would free us all and yet leave us with nothing. I hope that hundreds of years after me there will be a near perfect world.Probably without us we are not made for such a world.Thanks if you read this to the end ";

	schema:reviewBody "!Warning some spoilers contained!I didn't really care for this documentary because it's format is not very academic. Jacque Fresco seeks to educate and inform but his method is not very professional. He simply asserts an idea as truth and then moves on the next idea to build his case against the practice of fractionalreserve banking. I don't entirely disagree with all of his ideas I would even support banking reform based off of this documentary I just wish he would go about it in a more professional and academic method.The foundation for the modern form of education debate and critical viewing of ideas goes back to Socrates Plato and earlier philosophers. One of the most important maxims that has evolved is the idea of citing your sources. I have watched Zeitgeist and Zeitgest Addendum and Mr. Jacque Fresco is terrible at citing sources. If I lived in 1200 A.D.C.E. and someone simply stated the world was round it would be really easy to dismiss them. If someone told me that they had done research and based on their calculations which were based on the calculations of other respected mathematicians that they believed the world was round it would be a lot harder to dismiss.. That's because now I'm not just dismissing the idea I'm dismissing the persons work their research other respected mathematicians and quite possibly scientific thought up until this point. That's a much larger hurdle than just dismissing a statement. Mr. Fresco's ideas are fairly easy to dismiss because he doesn't cite his sources well. Mr. Fresco does occasionally use references to academic journals magazines quotes and even cites a court case but he uses them as they suit his argument sometimes out of context and ignores evidence that doesn't concur. For example he uses the First National Bank of Montgomery v. Jerome Daly case to highlight that making money out of thin air is illegal and unconstitutional. He fails to highlight that the court case was later nullified by a higher court. That's a pretty important aspect for someone who is going to use that as evidence for building an argument but it's inconvenient so he fails to mention it.Mr. Fresco's ideas are definitely intriguing and cause pause for thought but they just do not hold up to the bombardment of critical thinking.".

	schema:reviewBody "I admit that the main reason why I find this so much better than the original is because this one didn't focus on 911 conspiracy theories. It does briefly reference it but it's in no way the main focus. I believe this is a very irrational belief that must stop. Anyway this movie was divided into four parts but it didn't seem to really talk about the same subjects in each. Well the first part was certainly about money. I especially love this because of how hopeful it was near the end. I stand by the notion that it's hypocritical to say that religion is dumb while believing in conspiracy theories.Still this film makes much better arguments. Aww we get to hear that nice narrator's voice throughout the whole movie! The best part is probably when he's talking about money. It was great to have audio from Bill Hicks and George Carlin. They certainly support what the movie says. I was expecting them to say abandon religion at the end. Of course they're probably implying that we should. Just remember Mr. Rogers. It's impossible for an awful ideology to make someone that good. I also like when it says that technology is the most tangible thing.This film supports few institutions and ideals. Food location and science are about the only real things that this film seems to praise. It does raise the question of how you'd build a tunnel for a train that fast. I'd think that would be pretty expensive. Well I probably just need to do more research. With Donald Trump becoming President we need to focus less on materialism than ever. Wait isn't technology technically a material? I've never heard of a documentary film series before or even a documentary sequel. I thought Michael Moore was making one at one point. 12".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is basically an indictment of all types of governments and economies which have ever existed on the planet. The film is centered around the ideas of the earnest Jacque Fresco who thinks technology will free all humans from competition with each other will allow us to do away with monetary societies dictatorships socialism and replace these with a resource based economies.If you accept Fresco's thinking that there is no such think as innate human behavior ie that literally everything we do is culturally dictated the blank slate theory then you might be susceptible to his impassioned line of hogwash. That is if you aren't very well read and are about 16 yrs. old.But anyone who has even the slightest knowledge of evolutionary biology and child development knows there is a HUGE biological component to human behavior. Like all animals we are hardwired for certain behavior patterns although our specific environments do indeed work upon our genetic endowments.I would expect most 12yr. old school children in developed nations have enough common sense to realize the fallacy of Fresco's argument if everything we do is shaped by our environment how did our impoverishing monetarybased slavery system even evolve in the first place? The answer is economic and governmental systems evolved and continue to better themselves organically in the most efficient ways possible according to how intellectually advanced the people in a given countryregion have become.In Fresco's utopian world there are no lazy people no criminals and no need for police. He thinks by doing away with the evil U.S. monetary system and creating technology to replace the jobs of 90 of the population his figure people would be so relieved and happy that peace on earth and goodwill toward men would rule the day.The problem Fresco doesn't answer is who the hell is making all those machines which will give 90 of us a life of leisure? Who is running the show and what on earth would prevent those leaders from allowing absolute power to corrupt them absolutely? Oh yeah...human nature is infinitely malleable according to Fresco. But...WHO is doing the molding? Apparently Mr. Fresco is. What would that make him...a Technology Tzar of the universe?A silly film all said and done and palatable only to dreamers who would deny human nature. Social engineering hasn't worked in the past anywhere in the world. America isn't perfect but our levels of economic and political freedom provide the highest standard of living human beings have ever experienced in the history of mankind. I just hope our socialistic president hasn't led us down the same path to ruin which Europe is currently on. Long live free markets! Down with the utopian social engineers who know better than we do what is good for us.".

His previous films Zeitgeist and Zeitgeist Addendum exploded him into public awareness on a global scale with a reported 40 million combined downloads. So what's the big deal? Zeitgeist MF is essentially a documentary with a superpolitical beyond politics agenda  the transition from today's current  and according to the film 'failing' economic paradigm  to a new 'resource based economy' that does away with money and politics altogether replacing these 'out of date' concepts with a new moneyless society where the world's resources plus the manufacturing of food and goods are constantly monitored and linked to an omniscient central computer hub which automatically synchs and optimises their distribution.The idea is that this vastly more efficient system is the only sustainable way to support a burgeoning population whilst maintaining a high if not far higher standard of living for all the world's people plus a clean green stable environment for all.The fear of the film which drives the need for such an alternative is that attempting to act within the current economic paradigm is tantamount to doing nothing. A vastly more radical systems approach to society is needed where the scientific method instead of 'opinion' becomes the new touchstone for decision making.The film argues that the world is in a deep crises that is about to get much worse. Technological unemployment is on the increase with no new 'services sector' there to mop up jobs lost to automation the population is exploding exponentially the volatile 'gambling cartels' of Wall Street create artificial bubbles and the resulting depressions with increasing irregularity which will only be made worse by purely automated computer trading pollution is rife top soil is disappearing the oceans will be empty by 2030 resources are being depleted far more rapidly than they can be restocked and the end of cheap energy will result in global chaos war and mass destruction.Phew. Hard to argue with the facts when they are laid bare for you to look at and study at your leisure all sources in the film have references like in a scientific journal which you can crossreference and check for yourself.All in all ZMF brings home a number of disturbing realities to the audience. More importantly  it actually provides answers. A way literally  to move forwards. If you are a member of 'the Movement' a global group of hundreds of thousands of individuals who believe in the vision of Jaques Fresco founder of the Venus Project  the basis of the entire theory that ZMF is a proponent of then a lot of this is old news to you.If however Zeitgeist is news to you and you are a member of the mainstream population who is tired of the toothlessness of democracy or the mindless lack of humanity of communism and fascism you may want to watch this film very closely indeed.If however you drive a Jeep like expensive handbags and couldn't care less what happens to billions of people worldwide then don't bother. You'll never get it anyway.This film takes Zeitgeist firmly away from conspiracy theorists Zionists 911 truthers and all the rest arguing that they are focused on the symptoms of the world's problems not the underlying cause. They also offer no answers. Amazingly Zeitgeist Moving Forward does.If you can handle the wellmeaning but slightly cheesy ending you'll do well to watch this film at a theater if you're quick or for free over the internet this is one film you can download without breaking any laws.Possibly one of the most important films you'll ever watch.".

I will also say that you can truly see a significant change in both mindset and skill set in the producer Peter Josephs work since the original films release in 2007. This film will find far more resonance with a far larger audience. The film is long. It runs 240 mins.

It takes no sides in the establishment basing its solutions on evidence and the scientific method in a general sense. This comes off as a radical approach to problems only because we don't see that in politics. But as far as radical notions go what Zeitgeist  Moving Forward presents doesn't seem out there at all. But the ideas here are really quite universal. They exist in every culture or religion as goals or things to work towards. But until now a clear case hasn't been presented on how to actually get there  how to solve the problems by taking them into account from the beginning. Strong societies require strong foundations  and not a country in the world currently has a foundation like that.".

This comes off as a radical approach to problems only because we don't see that in politics. But as far as radical notions go what Zeitgeist  Moving Forward presents doesn't seem out there at all. But the ideas here are really quite universal. They exist in every culture or religion as goals or things to work towards. But until now a clear case hasn't been presented on how to actually get there  how to solve the problems by taking them into account from the beginning. Strong societies require strong foundations  and not a country in the world currently has a foundation like that.";

We do have a problem and it needs to be addressed. The movie will inspire thinking of a different alternative than what we have now. Most people have never been exposed to problems that could arise in the future maintaining the current system. The Venus Project is only a dream just like going to the moon. I would suggest everyone to watch the movie. Its free in most cases and will be on the Internet for free soon. Just a different way of looking at things that might just help.

	schema:reviewBody "DescriptionThe movie is in four parts. It mixes traditional documentary style interviews visualisation and commentary with an artistic 'story' that's split up and shown in parts throughout the film. There are also a few funny 'sketches' inserted at various places to help make a point and break up the heavy nature of the content.Before part one there is an overlylong nine minute introduction which has the first part of the artistic 'story' and a very interesting miniautobiography of Jacque Fresco.Part one does a fantastic job of explaining the relevant points from the Nature Vs. Nurture debate. It uses both empirical and analytical study to explain the biological and psychological basis for many of the negative human behaviours we see today including many types of addiction violence distrust lack of empathy and greed.Part two is a devastating analysis of the monetary market system which very clearly shows how the current system creates the perfect environment for nurturing the negative behaviours described in part one.Part three presents the ideal case for how humans should conduct themselves on this planet as if we suddenly arrived here and had the option to design our society such that it provides for everyone and eliminates the causes of negative human behaviours. It contrasts these ideas with the current system showing why the negative aspects of today's society would not occur and how we could have the benefits of a modern firstworld luxury lifestyle on a global scale. However this part also goes into detail about Jacque's 'Circular City' design as if this were the only logical conclusion for how a city should be designed within this ideal society when really it is just one idea amongst any number of potential designs.Part four reassesses today's society in light for the first three parts saying what will happen if we do nothing. This part also suggests that change will only occur after things get much worse.My opinionsThe artistic 'story' element is quite good despite the cheesy ending. I didn't really like the first part of this as I felt it was too long but I did like how the men behind the curtain were portrayed as living in the past with newspapers cigars and an old phone while everyone else is wanting change. I also liked the spoof brand names and TV footage on the screens.The 'funny' interjections were a bit mixed some were relevant and amusing while others belaboured a point and weren't funny.As for the main documentary I feel it could have been much shorter and more concise. The content is really amazing especially the interviews and how they are edited together. It is worth spending the time to watch it but I sometimes found myself thinking get on with it.The ideal society presented in part three is obviously not achievable immediately anyone can see that we would need to transition towards it even if the entire planet was in agreement about it. I think that the movie fails to explain this which will leave people unwilling to believe it is possible.I was very disappointed with the last part as it presented a despairing view about social change. My personal hopes for this movie were that it would present some possible ways we could 'move forward' and include some calls to action for TZM members and chapters to start the projects required to do so.However overall I can't find fault in the arguments presented except for the circular city which is a fundamentally flawed design because it is highly efficient and not very versatile. When meeting the constantly changing needs of a human population flexibility and adaptation should be the most important requirements of the design and efficiency should come secondary to these. Evolution has shown us this many times over.Despite my criticisms of some parts I still think this is a brilliant film that will help us change the world for the better and therefore a mustwatch.".

And it DOES matter if you just decide to ignore the problem because you feel you NEED to own more and more THINGS. Greed IS a sickness.And that the reasons i have felt so uncomfortable in the world for so many years STEM from being forced into a culture where MONEY is truly worshiped on a religious scale.Society is ALWAYS in evolution.

It makes me even more driven to try and reenvision the world as a place VOID of the destructive forces of greed and lack of empathy for one's fellow human beings.And that our current sociopolitical and monetary paradigms which most unquestioningly take as truth are but one way of approaching the world and a very destructive one at that.And that our need for more and more OWNERSHIP is counterintuitive to nature and contrary to so much of what science has taught us.And that the idea of PLANNED OBSOLESENCE thus creating our disposable culture is destroying literally EVERYTHING around us for the profit of the money junkies.The Earth is NOT an infinite resource. And it DOES matter if you just decide to ignore the problem because you feel you NEED to own more and more THINGS. Greed IS a sickness.And that the reasons i have felt so uncomfortable in the world for so many years STEM from being forced into a culture where MONEY is truly worshiped on a religious scale.Society is ALWAYS in evolution. Sometimes even revolution.resource based economy. empathy for ALL beings.investigate yourself. be who and what you are not what you own.don't just ignore me.";

Not from fighting cause that's not the point but simply from denying this miserable way of life...I know many people will see it and say not in a million years could this happen and be cynical about it but i think that's where our problem lies we don't understand that if history would to be changed it would be changed by us and not the powerful ones. If they wanted to change a thing they would have done it already!They support this system because it supports them but why the hell do we support it?! 10 out of 10 from me just because of it's motivations! And spare me these conspiracy theories crap because they don't stand a chance in the world envisioned by Fresco no one can enslave you and run your life when there is no money involved.

And i just cannot believe that Fresco and Meadows have spent all of their lives creating The Venus Project believing that some day they could rule us all or be that naive suggesting a culture that can create such behaviors...I personally believe in the Zeitgeist Movement cause it is run by everyday people like me people with consciousness and social awareness that supports a new way of living and thinking. They're not to blame more than the people that go and vote for governors who have proved over and over again that they are useless to help and solve any real problem. It's the most irrational thing in the history of human beings to believe that even if you change the president with someone decent he wont eventually do the same or be put out of the game cause he wont serve the bank's and company's interest.In other words just go and see this movie the least it can do is to put you in a different thinking mode and that's what it is all about...".

If everyone gets their fair share what is the motivation to toil in difficult jobs that will never be made redundant such as the sciences computing or robotics? An individual's life can never be better than his neighbour's. So is societal gain from your endevours enough of an incentive to spend your life toiling in a science lab rather than do less challenging work? Given the choice most people would choose an easy life.Secondly the natural conclusion of this new society is Gattaca. The first half hour of Z explains that criminals addicts etc are more a product of their environment than genetically predisposed. By removing the bad environment so the argument goes  poverty poor education healthcare inequality etc the conditions that create problematic people are removed. Sounds plausible. However would such a society not then place far more emphasis on the quality of your genes? Environment and cause  effect would no longer be factors everyone would receive good upbringings. The distinguishing factor would be genetic. And that essentially is the dystopia depicted in Gattaca an excellent film btw.To those who say this solution is communist which has been tried and failed  this solution is not communist. It is postcommunist. With the power of modern computers the efficient resourceallocation system could be operated on a decentspec home computer. The reason communism kept failing is that it inevitably led to a corrupt elite who were rightfully deposed by popular uprising. If everyone can duplicate the system on which resources are allocated themselves on their own computers there can be no accusation of corruption. There would be healthy debate and democratic decision making as to the rules and inputs to the system but there would be no elitist subversion of the planned economy that people hated so much about communism nor capitalism's elite 1 owning 40.So in summary not the definitive blueprint it wants to be but food for thought nevertheless.".

	schema:headline " Is a review what this film needs?";
	schema:reviewBody "I give it 10 out of 10 not because it is flawless not because it is beyond criticism but because for me it excellently achieves its primary objective of stimulating radical thought in an entertaining way. And though entertainment is important it is unfortunately so not happily so. We must at this critical historical juncture teach ourselves to listen with an open mind to those ideas which offer a way through the unfolding crises which together threaten civilization and much life on earth regardless of their production values or slickness or 'bang for your buck.' We are tasked as are all specieswith surviving our faults and adapting to all challenges thrown our way. For a multitude of reasons explored brilliantly in the film we humans have become too attached to ideologies which prevent us from thinking dispassionately about The New. We are preventing ourselves from adapting to ongoing and inevitable change for cultural reasons risking our own demise due to cultural inflexibility. Peter Joseph's film helps us open up and think again.What is offered here as The New is very simple indeed though its implications are both profound and far reaching.

And though entertainment is important it is unfortunately so not happily so. We must at this critical historical juncture teach ourselves to listen with an open mind to those ideas which offer a way through the unfolding crises which together threaten civilization and much life on earth regardless of their production values or slickness or 'bang for your buck.' We are tasked as are all specieswith surviving our faults and adapting to all challenges thrown our way. For a multitude of reasons explored brilliantly in the film we humans have become too attached to ideologies which prevent us from thinking dispassionately about The New. We are preventing ourselves from adapting to ongoing and inevitable change for cultural reasons risking our own demise due to cultural inflexibility. Peter Joseph's film helps us open up and think again.What is offered here as The New is very simple indeed though its implications are both profound and far reaching. Zeitgeist and The Venus Project are about developing a social system which prioritizes sustainability first and foremost.

	schema:reviewBody "Zeitgeist Moving forward is the third installment in Peter Joseph's Zeitgeist film trilogy after 2007's Zeitgeist  2008's Zeitgeist Addendum. It's by far the most well rounded of the three films. It didn't seem like it was going too far into the messy and very chaotic unclear paranoia conspiracy theories like the previous films. It's seem much grounded with its facts and how to tell them. It had some structure a sense of order. It didn't felt like a mindless rant. It was indeed a wellmade movie that seem to flow factual. The first half of the film explains the problems of our society while the second half explains a positive solution to those problems. It's very simple when you think about it. The movie brings the complexity of society down a level to make it a little more understandable. The film is arranged into four parts. Each part discuss how the current world wide situation is disastrous. Part I Human Nature discuss human behavior when it comes to the nature vs. nurture debate. The overall conclusion tells us that negative social environment and cultural conditioning does play a large part in shaping human behavior! Part II Social Pathology adds to it saying that capitalism system is that unhealthy factor because it makes people feel anxiety feel inequality toward each other and most of all create over consumption. The film continues to state out that current attitude of the monetary system would only result in future default and bankrupts. I agree with most of what's said but I have to add to it that other economic systems such as communism  fascism feed worst unhealthy life choices. To say that capitalism is the worst one is pretty headstrong there. It's Part 3 Project Earth where the film gets kinda tricky with its approach. The film rehash the same retelling of why the resourcebased economy by American futurist and selfdescribed social engineer Jacque Fresco is the best choice. I get it! I have studied economics in a post graduate level and come to accept RBE to be a viable alternative. What the film fails to show is how we get from a capitalism society into a resourcebased economy. It really needed to discuss in a more realistic economic tone how we could start to change our ways into a resourcebased economy. In my opinion Syndicalism or Georgism economic beliefs might make the transformation a lot smoother. Another problem with a resource based economy is the fact that most people would still operate in a monetary aesthete greedy fashion. While ethicist type people might find this life great. Aesthete people that makes up the majority of society would be bored always wanting something new. The whole idea of trying to eliminate external restriction AKA ownership might rattle these beliefs causing people to try to gain more control on their own lives. Yes ownership is wasteful at times but fortunately human beings love wasting time and effect on illogic things. While strategic access does work within a means. It does not solve everything. Not everybody lives within a Jacque Fresco perfect circle. Honestly how are we supposed to build these cities in regions where resources are just way too hard to come by? We can't use money that's for sure! This is one of the problems with Jacque Fresco. Jacque Fresco is hardly the person to tell people that this sht need to go when he himself often fund his Venus Project with money rather than volunteers. It's very hypocritical. Another problem is the science it proposed to use. The science to maintain a resourcedbased economy has far more assumptions built in to it than results both in human nature  economics sciences. In conclusions these notions that science will save society is a gross error. Despite not being religionist driven project the idea of having a godlike computer control onelife based on polls and surveys of others is very scary thought. It eliminate the idea of one selfworth. Surely such powers might be abused from the inception to control the masses. I really doubt people would give up their limited freedoms for no freedoms. Another problem is that RBE is based upon the argument that scarcity is artificial which is absolutely breathtakingly wrong. Scarcity happens. If a resourcebased economy was to happen tomorrow the technology for it wouldn't be ready. In many ways it might not be ready if it did. I really wish the movie would offer something more solid to make it easier for people to abandon the capitalism system. I also think the movie gives a lot of credit to Jacque Fresco for create this socioeconomic system. Resourced based economy isn't new. In many ways its sounds like natural socialism. A concept older than Marxism himself. Part IV Rise presented a case that pollution deforestation climate change overpopulation and warfare are all created and perpetuated by the socioeconomic system. I found this part to be interesting. Sadly the movie had to ruin it with it's over the top ending with a 6 or 7 minute long vignette that shows a bunch of people drawing all of their money out of the banks and throwing it away in order to show that they don't need the global economy to live. While it was made to look powerful I really found it cheesy. I have to say as a whole movie it was very well done. The interviewers narration and animated sequences were amazing to watch due to how informative it was. The run time might be a little too long but there were hardly any slow spots. It's by far the most entertaining of the three films due to the film mixing humor and dramatic so well. Overall It's a must watch!".

How concise and clear is that? But really let me elaborate hopefully without boring you.The final and critical chapter in the Zeitgeist series Zeitgeist Moving Forward gets right down to the essentials. We are living in a system that does not help us the monetary and market system. Peter Joseph was a stock broker for 6 years but left the financial sector realizing that it created no real value to society.This system of free market competition and socioeconomic divide is the biggest problem. Before looking at the ideologies between capitalism or socialism democracy or dictatorship liberal or conservative etc. we need to realize how this underlying reality of our world is affecting us now and in the near future in diverse and very fundamental ways. The rest is in fact almost irrelevant. As we changed from the barter system to the money system we are on the verge of recognizing we need a newer system all together. Planned obsolescence of products the continuous creation of debt and the exploitation of natural and human resources in a neverending spiral of moneyhungry economy is duplicity in drudgery. Inefficiency waste and sickness are intrinsic part of the system. The proposed solution is a radical change to a resourcebased economy and the use of science and technical advances including automation and a continuous survey of local and global resource with distribution and sharing without the current concept of ownership.To the detractors of the proposed system there are many answers based on scientific findings. For the constantly claimed unstable social elements potential problems the idea of victims of culture is well explained and a culture shift education and action without judgement are keys to the potent paradigm shift. When people have their needs met the adaptation becomes easier.The film feature many interviews some narration and a few animations and scenes. The longest film of the series 161 mins is well written and edited even if the subjects actually can be much more explored in further details. After a musically  visually engaging intro and anecdote by 94yearold Jacque Fresco the movie starts rather slowly. The Part I  II Human Nature  Social Pathology discuss some concepts that will build the overall premise but with limited intensity in the flow of ideas. The nature vs. nurture debate is slightly debunked and the idea of a strong environment component along with clear cultural conditioning in ultimately shaping human behaviour is put forward in Part I. We then see the details of the philosophy of ownership theory of property by John Locke in the late 17th century and the machination of the market system as the first part of Part II. Joseph then revisits the ideas of the monetary system we know and its failings which were discussed differently in the first two films.The crux of the film tries to fulfil its title of Moving Forward and proposes to first reset the planet and its people and try to build a better system from scratch with at its base better goals more appropriate ideas and superior tools. Project Earth Part III advances many of the ideas of Jacque Fresco's Project Venus and shows the use of computers and automation as the next logical step even to create homes and reduce human labour construction work and related accidents. Same goes for car accident deaths and pollution among many proposed benefits of the plan in progress. The good thing about science is that it needs to be tested and that its ideas are always open to better ideas that represent and acts upon reality better we are told. Maybe that point could have been repeated as I find it to be quintessential to the approach of this film and perhaps to humankind's advancement as a whole. Part IV Rise is a peaceful but determined call to action and also a call for creative people to get involved in thinking now about how we can better our derelict and detrimental ways or living. For someone who wrote a novel Paradise on Earth? about a utopian society without money while being 19 to 22yearold I can definitely relate and I am elated at the created sense of urgency with thoughtout openminded but basically feasible and achievable aspirations for real world awakening in the midst of this mindnumbing masked mayhem we meander and marinate in militantly or unconsciously.In a world where empathy and trust are often empty and lost the Zeitgeist trilogy and especially part 2  3 may well be the best thing since CouchSurfing...".

The film series is not to be confused with The Zeitgeist Movement but they are in fact collections of data displayed in the form of entertainment we know as film to influence the direction the movement advocates.For instance many arguments against the transition out of the monetary paradigm is human nature which has been debated long before the film series came about pretty much whenever someone brought up the idea of global change. Moving Forward opens with a segment dedicated towards explaining that people's behaviors are shaped out of their genetics' engagements with environment into attributes misconstrued as human nature and how dangerous the argument of it's genetic really is in referral to the implausibility of change.In maturation from the other two films these understandings are translated through interviews with experts who have spent their lives studying experimenting researching and experiencing these ideas to be true. There are very few quotes or miscellaneous video clips in this film it is largely interview based as you will notice it is listed as a documentary and not a documentary video on this website. The information that is articulated through narration is also unlike the other films given little vulnerability to skepticism as it is prominently sourced with charts graphs and articles that are explained in detail instead of sudden flashes across the screen. The narration in this film is less of a rant dictation or brainstorming activity but more a gravity that pulls together the information presented in the interviews and the variety of existing evidence supporting the ideas of the film.Like the other films Zeitgeist Moving forward demonstrates what several have agreed to be some of the best editing to be witnessed on film coupled with what is a more subtle but still an appropriate and enjoyable score. The film is also more cinematically entertaining than the other two frequented with laughable moments and more pressure breaks titled in that they allow for a breath of the film's running time and its subject matter.For those who are afraid of this film that it will interfere with the way things are and what is known to be reality it should be noted that this is a very positive movie experience. I attended the Los Angeles premier with over 800 other people. There was a standing ovation at the end lots of smiles and cheers and hugs suffice to say a profusely moving collective exclamation of happiness and hope something is seldom seen today and when is seen is often shallow and dead ended.Moving Forward offers a realistic and accessible approach to the society we live within today and the behaviors exhibited in this society. It offers what is not only a necessary but a very much possible transition into an alternatively sustainable societal outline and goes into detail explaining what this way of living entails.Zeitgeist III explains ultimately it is found within ourselves and the choices we make every day to either perpetuate destructive or at the very most  not entirely satisfactory lives or to finally recognize ourselves and each other and our interrelation to the planet we all share so to progress together towards a better way of living for everyone. It is not depressing aggressive ambiguously conspiracy driven or the worst in my opinion left with loose ends. It is an extremely intelligent and highly enjoyable movie bringing about awareness and inspiration through an awakening to how things are and what beauty waits for us in the future.".

After they discover that the daughters are two of their biggest fans the mother isn't quite what she seems and the father is perhaps more than their equal the killers realize the cops are the least of their worries.

Some of the acting is love it or hate it stuff  the writer Dave Larsen plays Odessa James as a cross between Kiefer Sutherland and Mickey Rourke and I found some of his dialogue a little unintelligible  but ultimately I loved the cheesy charm of this film. It's also great looking  the film's scenes are bathed in a lovely blue light in the early scenes  very stylish.The DVD set is a 2 disc set but the second disc has only trailers and a Germanlanguage only short on it. Still it's a great looking Disc 1 and worth the purchase price IMHO.".

I recommend it to those who loved the insanity of Natural Born Killers or if you just want to try something different. Dave Larsen as Odessa displayed some great acting abilities and reminded me of Mickey Rourke back in his hay days not to mention he looked bad ass with skeleton face makeup and wielding a shotgun.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is so painfully underrated that I just had to take up for how great it really is. This is a scathing perverse horror satire that has a lot to say about American society its illusions and the byproduct waste of wars to keep the dream alive. And I give a SPOILER ALERT now before going further into this. There is a quote on the box that stated that this movie was probably going to be better at the point Natural Born Killers was trying to make than said overhyped movie itself. I have to say I was not let down. As the movie gets rolling we see early on that this is in large part a commentary on how the mass media emphasizes so much on reallife violence that it can inspire a following for even the most vicious of killers. We meet a seemingly nice average allAmerican family who with the exception of a pothead older daughter seem like something out of a Leave It to Beaver episode. At least in a more modern sense seeing as how their addiction to constant media bombardment shows dark pleasures inside them from the start. This film is so nihilistic and dark that the characters you're to be rooting for from the beginning have just gotten through with the brutal revenge killing of an entire family children included leaving no remorse whatsoever. Don't get me wrong this is part of its charm and if you don't dig movies like that avoid at all costs. Still I love it. The cynical antiheroes have excellent dialogue and the parts are carried out just as well by screenwriter Dave Larsen and David Gunn. I'm not going to give away a lot of major spoilers but this movie does have some confusing things happening in it. Where does the little girl go? I for one feel that a lot of confusion could be cleared up if the backers who released this would put out an uncut version with the full NINE MINUTES that they hacked out of this movie against the wishes of director Mike Mendez who seemingly dislikes this movie mostly because of how the backers of the film altered Mendez' work so much that the film as effective as it is doesn't work as well as it should have as a result. Otherwise everything else done with this comes off really well. The humor is very morbid pitchblack even cruel at times but it is there all throughout the film meaning this movie is not meant to be taken totally seriously. This should be obvious seeing as how more outrageous this film becomes with each and every frame. It does start a bit slow but if it didn't it wouldn't be as effective. This is a movie that works on the element of surprise and the shocks are more shocking when you start to expect the rest of this movie to not have any. Then suddenly it hits you with one shock after another and these shocks get more tense and frequent with a momentum that builds up until the cynical and abrupt finality. The spoiler I'm about to include is that of how the last character standing still gets offed. At the same time he is about ready to die death being a relief he can no longer put off or avoid. This is definitely an excellent film by all accounts other than those that were faults more of the backers' than anyone else's. I like this film much more than Mendez' overhyped and more juvenile The Convent and as for the characters trying too hard to be cool I really think some people ought to lighten up with how they view these movies. The antiheroic characters in this aren't trying to be cool. They just are cool whether anyone likes it or not. Every terrible thing they do stems from how miserable they are. They're not great guys but the reason you're supposed to like them is that they are far less contemptible than any of the other main characters. Real Killers definitely deserves more attention and praise than it has gotten.".

The main thing to appreciate here is the dialogue. Like most things in a Mendez film its quality fluctuates but said dialogue is consistently quite good in this film and the police shoptalk seems to have been pretty well researched as well.The main thing this movie is is fun. I'm personally one of those cinephiles willing to forgive the bad elements of a film in favor of the overall vision and scope of the film. However while i enjoyed Real Killers overall i must say that the social criticisms and commentaries felt secondhand and that the film has no real message as far as I'm concerned but more mimed and aped morals from movies the director admires. However the story istelf is whats most prevalent in the movie with the pithy dialogue an underpinning for the whole production.Not a terrible film not a brilliant film. Real Killers is some good Bmovie fare suitable for fans of this type of genre.M.".

However while i enjoyed Real Killers overall i must say that the social criticisms and commentaries felt secondhand and that the film has no real message as far as I'm concerned but more mimed and aped morals from movies the director admires. However the story istelf is whats most prevalent in the movie with the pithy dialogue an underpinning for the whole production.Not a terrible film not a brilliant film. Real Killers is some good Bmovie fare suitable for fans of this type of genre.M.";

The characters in this movie give INTERMINABLE speeches commenting on human character society and so forth in what the writer clearly thought were clever turns of phrase.  They aren't the least bit clever though and the audience is routinely assaulted by the scriptwriters' utter disrespect for brevity and their mistaken belief that they have something insightful to say.  Very little of the characters' ultracool gassy expository journeys furthers the narrative one bit.  Indeed they are brick walls that the train of the narrative crashes into.The last 15 minutes of the movie is a nonstop gunfight. I like movie gunfights as much as the next guy...this one is stupid at best adolescent and sadistic at worst.  People are shot repeatedly without flinching and without losing their supercool grimace of determination.  In one particularly gratuitous and unwholesome scene a woman is shot from below in the groin and the bullet exits her mouth.  Nice huh?Will this movie find an audience?  Sure.  Disenfranchised adolescent boys of the Dylan and Kleebold caliber might cozy up to this prolix gunfest.There's a reason this 1996 movie wasn't released for so many years  It is embarrassingly awful.

Just what the hell is this supposed to be? A hardboiled thriller a demented black comedy or perhaps another social mockamentary pointing out to us how easily we glorify violence. The title priority refers to the notorious James brothers two handsome but relentless maniacs sentenced to death for murdering their parents. They now escaped from their maximumsecurity cells and travel through California until they take a middleclass family hostage in the quiet little town of Beatty. However the Ryan family members aren't as defenseless as they seem. The women Mrs. Ryan and her two teenage daughters followed the James brothers' trial on television and developed a huge crush on their perpetrators. But that's still the least of their concerns as the family also hides far crazier secrets. The sudden plot twist near the middle is extremely retarded but at least it woke me up again! I already started dozing off since it looked like another pseudointellectual portrait about serial killers that seem to have all the knowledge in the world and yet use it to commit crimes. The dialogs are fluent but they handle about everything you already heard before in Natural Born Killers and some of the unexpected twists are really too crazy for words. There's plenty of violence but I still somehow expected Killers to be more grim and sadistic. It's mainly gunfire action and shouting so I anticipated a little more physical violence reminiscent to  for example  the torture scenes in Reservoir Dogs. The plot holes and improbabilities are too numerous to mention but the acting performances are decent and there's even some on screen sleaze to admire as well. Killers is not a total waste of time but it's severely lacking personality and power to become a cult favorite.".

I am a fairly intellectual well grounded individual hence when I saw the cover and read the blurb I realised hmm this might not be the kind of mind expanding life changing piece of artistry that will provide fun for all the family. It is fun with a well shot gritty artistry that works around the fact that this is done on a shoe string yes the dialogue is occasional bad and often too wordy but there are times when It's just plain funny. It is very violent and it does revel in it but I think that a major part of the film it is magnifying the fact that America is trying to keep cohesion in the family whilst reconciling a growing culture of violence at least thats my view I have been known to over think these things. In short If your a gore hound switch your brain off enjoy the movie ignore the faults its fun if your a preacher watch free willy a film only made good by micheal madsen smoking constantly throughoutwatch the movie you'll understand".

	schema:reviewBody "What the hell did I just watch??? I stumbled across this Director today and liked the first film I saw of his The Gravedancers so much I had to look up his other movies. This one caught my eye and I'm so glad it did. I'm still reeling from that insanity but loved every moment of it. I read that he made this flick with a budget of under 100000 and that 9 minutes of his movie were hacked off despite his objections. Yet even with those obstacles to it's success this movie still has lashings of charm and is well worth seeing. I read a lot of reviews suggesting Mendez is trying to be Tarantino or Lynch  I disagree. He is just being Mendez. I can see from the two movies I watched that he has his very own distinct style  an insane style  but quite definitely all his own. Why do people think anyone who is different is trying to be those two overrated directors anyway? I love Tarantino's flicks and SOME of Lynch's work but they are not the be all and end all of interesting directing. There are other more talented and offthewall directors around and it's a little sad that they are less widely known except among the diehard horrorthriller fans!!. One thing's for sure Mendez has a much wackier sense of humor than either of those two from what I've seen so far and doesn't take himself anywhere near as seriously thank goodness.In a world flooded with bland horror movies  uninspired copycat directors it's always a thrill to discover one who does his own thing even if his style may not suit everyone. We should be supporting efforts like this  keeping in mind this was a debut effort on a teeny tiny budget  regardless of it's flaws. Yes the lighting has problems the acting was suss the dialogue a little clunky etc etc But there is much to be admired in this movie and Mendez has won a new fan today.SEE IT!!! And watch it with no expectations and an openmind and try not to read any spoilers!!. You will love it. I've given it an 8 taking into account the low low budget the unfortunate hacking of his finished movie and his newness as a director. I hope he gets to work with a big budget and quality actors one day. PS I loved BOB!!!!".

What i saw when i came to press play was a deformed zombieesquire womanthing poring one of the kidnapping killers a glass of champagne the film at this point had completely gone off the rails and gone into the realms of weirdness.

It shows that the one truth we are fed daily is a carefully crafted lie which hold us spellbound. I regret the movie replaces the seentrough lies with conclusions which had better not been drawn it would have sufficed to point to the many similarities between The Bible and older books like the Egyptian book of the dead without adding the conclusion that Jesus of Nazareth might never have existed. Emphesizing this option as being the most likely one takes the focus away from the extensive lies which surround Christianity for certain as is exposed in this film.It rightly connects the tragic events of 911 with the true perpetrators thereof and does not shy from showing the terrible consequences in human life both on that day and in the years that followed in a fraudulous War on Terror which to most people in it is very real but for its inventors just a cruel joke on a population of semisentient humans who slaughter human life as some humans would slaughter cattle.Finally it reveals that unbelievable manipulation has reached a 100year anniversary after the 1907 panic and the 1913 introduction of the Ferderal Reserve bill which opened the way to stage not one but two World Wars which to the casual beholder did little to change the balance of power in the world but in truth transfered power from the open to the shadows on a grand scale.A film worth watching over and over again  if you can stomach its dreadful horrors both in picture and in concept.".

Whether or not you believe it outright or not the questions provoked by the film are worth asking and can't be ignored. The supposed evidence provided by the government to substantiate their final explanation is feeble at best when compared to the perhaps theoretical evidence offered by films and articles of this kind. I agree that the people are conditioned to accept media as truth and thus have accepted the government as such also. The people have allowed the government and media to strip them of their thirst for truth by tricking them into believing anything. As responsible people we can't sit back and allow this to continue. We are entitled to the truth and we are not getting it. I'm not saying that this film is 100 correct or anything like that. I'm only saying that to any reasonably intelligent person it's obvious that there are major deceptions at work here. The longer we ignore them the more we become them until eventually it just won't matter because there won't be anything we can do about it.

If you watch it and accept all statements facts and sources given to you in that movie blindly then you start believing that aliens did start human civilization. But a further critical look at Chariots of The Gods revealed that it is only a fairytale. It has no real evidence of its grand claims  no smoking gun.And the same is the problem with Zeitgeist. It is a biased and poorly made documentary. Just because some antireligious people want there to be an evil conspiracy behind all religions doesn't make it true. Zeitgeist is a fun piece of fiction. But that is all it is. It has whether you like it or not no hard evidence. It is simply just speculations and questionable sources. The manuscript and allegations of Zeitgeist would never make it to be a paper on a real university those mailorder universities where all conspiracy theorists get their degrees from are not respectable or real universities. The allegations of Zeitgeist can turn out to be true in the long run. But until this day they have no hard evidence of their claims  they lack the smokinggun kind of evidence. Therefore people should not take this poor documentary seriously until hard and unquestionable evidence have been found.

	schema:reviewBody "In the musical 'Chicago' Billy Flynn sings a song about how he thinks the world works Just wow them and they'll fall for it. This film is a prime example.It wows you by bombarding you over the head with images and sounds quite shocking to the average viewer and because of the way it is put together it seems quite compelling. However looking a bit closer after an initial viewing shows that the film is nothing more than paranoiamongering.The film starts off with an 'overture' in which music that sounds like that of Philip Glass that is if Philip Glass was stupid and drunk plays over repeated images of explosions and other stock footage eventually coming to the image of an airplane striking the World Trade Center along with a picture of a hand writing 224 when other hands wrench the paper away from him and replace it with a Bible and a folded American flag. It then fades to black with what looks like a Windows Media Player backdrop where a is talking about 'establishments' that are meant to control you. It then moves to George Carlin's Invisible Man in the Sky monologue before going into the film proper.The film consists of three parts 1. The Greatest Story Ever Told 2. All The World's A Stage 3. Don't Mind The Men Behind the CurtainThe thing about the film is that it's very slickly edited. After it's overture it seems to turn somewhat more mild. The very first four words of part one spoken by the writercomposereditor Peter Joseph This is the sun. From there it moves on to talk about how Jesus was ripped off of several other deities from other civilizations which are all identical sun gods throwing in 'son god.' After spending time discussing Christianity and other religions and coming to the conclusion that 'religion is the fraud of the age' it moves to part 2 where it makes a very startling accusation indeed The United States Government planned carried out and covered up the 2001 September 11th attacks. Then in part 3 it talks about the Federal Reserve and how it has been behind all of our economic crises and wars and how there is a 'New World Order' waiting to come and enslave us all.But the sad fact is there is not a single original thought in this entire film. Part 1 is essentially a pitch for authors such as Dorothy Murdoch aka Acharya S. who has written a number of books that argue Jesus never existed and was in fact plagiarized from earlier religions a theory that has never been accepted by mainstream scholars.Part 2 is virtually indistinguishable from the myriad of 911 'Truth' Films  Loose Change 911 Mysteries etc.And Part 3 is essentially Aaron Russo's 'America Freedom to Fascism.' Peter Joseph even takes Russo's word about the RFID chip that is supposed to be used to control us.And it is about as factual as it is original. Here are just a few of the myriad of falsehoods in the film.1. A large bulk of the 'Jesus sun god' line in Part 1 rests on the contention that Jesus was born on December 25th. While that is the traditional date used for Christmas no religious source actually gives a date. There were several dates used for celebration. Even today many Orthodox Christians around the world celebrate Christmas on dates that are not December 25th such as in January.2. In part 2 they make the contention that the hijackers are still alive. This was a very popular talking point for 911 conspiracy theorists for quite some time but it is simply false. The source of this is a BBC article. After the list of suspected hijackers was released some people with the same names as the suspected hijackers called in to voice their confusion. However the fact of the matter is that they shared only the same name. The BBC later admitted that it was a case of mistaken identity. It also defies logic that these 'conspirators' would leave their 'hijackers' to blow the whistle in this manner.3. In part 3 it claims that there is not law that requires you to pay an income tax. This is a lie plain and simple. It is right there in the Internal Revenue Code for anyone who isn't lazy to read. This point was proved wrong when Russo said it and Mr. Joseph has no excuse for repeating it.4. He says that the 16th Amendment is unconstitutional. Nobody seems to complain much about the other twentysix Amendments though unless you're Ann Coulter and you think women shouldn't have the right to vote or something which are all unconstitutional by similar standards.5. He talks about the cause of WWI with the Lusitania. He talks about a conversation that seems to imply that the sinking of the Lusitania was planned. He argues that the Fed and the people behind it wanted the ship to sink so they could go to war. Well he fails to say exactly what the 'men behind the curtain' did to cause it. He says that they wanted it to happen but he does not offer a shred of evidence to support the notion that the 'men behind the curtain' caused it. Even more egregiously he makes no mention of the Zimmerman Telegram. As influential as the sinking of the Lusitania was it was the Telegram that caused the US to enter war.There are people who say that this is the most important documentary of our time and others say that it doesn't matter if everything the film says is false and that the point is that it makes you think about things.Lies do matter. And when this film that purports to destroy lies is made of lies itself you need to reconsider the merits.".

This movie is guilty of some of the most appalling logical fallacies and blatant cherry picking of factual information it has ever been my distinct displeasure to have observed. It is nothing short of terrible.Documentaries are a difficult animal at the best of times. Even very successful documentary makers often stray into very heavily opinion based presentation of a story while attempting to present an unbiased view. The medium offers people with a certain point of view not just the chance to portray their ideas but the opportunity when combined with careful editing and a clever accompanying marketing campaign to portray their ideas in such a way that it discredits even the development of any dissenting ideas on the grounds that anyone presenting such an idea is either ignorant or actively in the employ of the enemy. If the film maker is really clever they can even structure their film to lead you to the conclusion that they are being unjustly persecuted for attempting to reveal the horrible truth.This film is possibly the ultimate expression of this kind of conspiracy propaganda presenting its ideas in a insultingly condescending manner like a childhood bully attempting to goad a less assertive kid into something he knows is wrong on the grounds it will make him cool. The comparison ends there though because unlike drinking a fifth of bourbon and then setting fire to a bunch of neighborhood door mats believing the crap that this film spews forth will not bring you streetcred with anyone who doesn't believe in unicorns.It required a substantial effort on my part to avoid breaking Godwin's while reviewing this film and as a nod to this I strongly recommend burning all remaining copies of this film.As an aside the use of the term Zeitgeist in the title of this movie is incomprehensible. I am a German speaker and the definition of zeitgeist has nothing to do with the content of this film.".

My good sense tells me that the Western World today as we know it are living a lie.

Think about it after wards and reflect on e.g. WHY there are so many godsons from different religions who all are born on the 25th of December WHY George W. Bush never made a statement alone or under oath regarding 911 WHY they are trying to enforce a North American Union over your heads WHY you DON'T have to pay income taxes since it doesn't exist by law and is in conflict with the Constitution itself WHY any American are completely stripped of ALL rights if they are under suspicion of being a TERRORIST WHY no historians EVER wrote about a Jesus Christ.

As interested as I am in conspiracy theories there's nothing worse than aimless hole picking which is essentially what this documentary constitutes.Perhaps the most insulting examples concern 911 and for the record I'm not saying there's nothing dubious about the events. For every fact this doc questions its ignorance towards its own questioning is infuriating. For there are counterarguments to every fact it questions but the doc fails to address them. Plus a fact means little without a debate about motive. For if 911 is not what we think then what is it? It is not enough to question veracity. People don't go to jail for lying about their alibi motive is necessary. It's this kind of ignorance that can be applied throughout the documentary and what leads to its ultimate failure.On an aesthetic level the film is terrible. I understand that it's nobudget but many sequences of archive and graphics are so heavyhanded and overlong that the doc which has potentially exciting subjectmaterial actually feels boring. Plus in the first section many of the theories are not attributed to its creators giving the narrator a false voice of authority.This project feels like an amateur conspiracy geek with little or no critical thinking faculties trying to give himself a voice a voice that gives a bad name for the intelligent individuals who question the official theories in the correct manner.".

	schema:reviewBody "The belief in the Big Other as an invisible power structure is the most succinct definition of paranoia  Slavoj Zizek We've seen these horror documentaries before. They all claim that a secret cabal is slowly conspiring to reduce human rights and enslave the world. They attempt to create a monomyth linking various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single allencompassing myth. A myth that explains the purpose and point and future of everything.Zeitgeist which plays on the paranoia of the internet generation itself implies that evil politicians and mysterious world leaders are secretly conspiring to oppress the human race. But the truth is such leaders are themselves servants to invisible systems and politicians aren't evil so much as they're products of a social system that is conducive of corruption.Zeitgeist's first act is essentially a short lecture on religion. It's overly sensationalistic but the documentary's point is generally true religions evolve over time our current religions borrow heavily from past myths and religion is itself simultaneously a tool for control an elaborate shared psychosis a social support network and a means for placating various existential anxieties.Zeitgeist's second act is it's weakest. Here we get an elaborate critique of the official 911 narrative the filmmakers analysing and debunking various aspects of the 2001 September 11th terrorist attacks. The jury's still out on all this.Zeitgeist's third act is perhaps its most important. Here the filmmakers critique various aspects of money creation banking cartels and debt based currency. These points are all correct of course but amount to a fairly superficial critique of capitalism. The truth's worse and far more shocking  capitalism is itself a shared psychosis  albeit in a prosaic way. One's far better off reading books by thermoeconomists steadystate advocates and any neoMarxist radically aligned against neoclassical economists.In a more general philosophical sense Zeitgeist is false to imply that there is some conscious scheming order out to get you. There is no order. These evil conspirators  which is not to say that shady figures don't commit conspiratorial crimes they do they're just don't quite know what they're doing  are every bit slaves to unconscious drives and physical currents. The actual entity doing the controlling does not exist. There is no Big Other no master plan or entity in possession of secret knowledge.Zeitgeist goes on to say that human beings will accept this new order because Americans are dumb mindless slaves addicted to pleasure seeking activities. Essentially this echoes Marx's ideas that a comfortable populace will never challenge its rulers for fear of rocking the boat and losing the few amenities it has. There's much truth in that and also the opposite as capitalism sucks more wealth up the pyramid people have less and become more violent. And yet according to sociological investigations people are increasingly finding less and less pleasure in recreational activities. This growing indifference towards intense pleasure contrasts with the official view that our society is bent on instant gratification. Lacan and Marcuse foresaw this decades ago when they essentially stated that subjects who dedicate their lives to pleasure would increasingly become so involved in preparatory activities that the joy of the official goal of their efforts fades away. We see this today with millions obsessed with prolonging youthbeautypleasure yet obviously living in permanent anxiety and under the shadow of ultimate failure. Today the command Enjoy! the motto of capitalism is a much more effective way to hinder man's access to enjoyment than outright prohibition which maintains a space for transgression. The lesson is that the selfish care of the Self and not a repressive group of conspirators is the ultimate enemy of intense pleasure experiences. Man's dream Utopia where he whimsically takes part in every conceivable masturbatory pleasure will increasingly morph into a kind of apathetic Antonionilike boredom. The direct intervention of pain weird sadomasochistic sexual practises etc or the escalations of perversions now seem the only remaining paths to intensity.Thus the fact that The Big Other doesn't exist has two consequences. Firstly the failure of symbolic fiction causes man to cling more and more to imaginary Simulacra films computers etc and secondly it triggers the need for violence of the body ie Cronenberg. Bizarrely we see these themes of repression sexuality knowledge and utopia in the Bible. In Genesis Adam and Eve tended to the Garden society obediently doing their duty and obeying the orders of God bureaucracy. They were naked repressed and stupid but they had food and water and enough kinky Biblical entertainment to keep them busy. Along came Satan the story's actual hero. He taught them the truth that it is wise to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. And so Adam and Eve taste the fruit gain wisdom develop a moral sense learn of their nakedness and challenge God. In the real world society is perhaps evolving backwards toward this Eden State. Man doesn't want to eat from the Tree of knowledge but wants his own isolated utopia with the right balance of abundance myopia and external Law. What's more he wants all his troubles decisions and fears to be taken care of by a paternalistic God where God represents bureaucracy and the symbolic Order. The irony is our current social models cannot support this it will take 610 planet earths worth of resources just to provide a middle class life for everyone currently on the planet. This creates little Satan's out of us all everyone waiting in the wings perhaps to be awakened and sent clawing at God.510  Scepticism is good but this is mostly a sensationalist horror movie.".

Possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time perhaps eyes that light up the main character's eyes occasionally turn green in the movie. The copy I watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic which had been removed. The novelty boxcover if it still had it would have been the only reason I would have held onto this movie I'm definitely getting rid of it.".

He also beds Dr. Mike's crush Sally after a whole day of knowing her. She has a son. His name is Tommy. He is an angry little boy.Metamorphosis isn't a terrible movie just not a well produced one. The whole time I watched this I couldn't get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989. The look and feel of the movie is late seventies quality at the latest. It does not help that it's packaged along with 1970's movies as Metamorphosis is part of mill creek entertainment's 50 chilling classics. There is basically no film quality difference whatsoever. The final five minutes are pure bad movie cheese that actually for me at least save the movie from a lower rating. Pay attention to the computer terminology such as cromosonic anomaly. No wonder Peter's experiment failed. Your computer can't spell! This is worthy of a view followed by a trip to your local tavern.".

This Italian bloke is more or less the personification of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every rancid Joe D'Amato production during the late 70'searly 80's. Wouldn't it be interesting for avid Eurocult purchasers to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around barebutted in Erotic Nights of the Living Dead all the time? I thought so! Now unlike the movies he starred in Eastman's own Metamorphosis is kind of disappointing in the gore  sleaze departments. There are a handful of nasty murders cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies a guest appearance by sleazequeen Laura Gemser! on display but it's mainly a talkative movie. The handsome  eloquent Dr. Houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human DNA codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds. He developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process but if he doesn't come up with detailed reports any time soon his research will be stopped. So Dr. Houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins. Needless to say and like the title implies he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker! In other words his research sucked! Like the other reviewers already mentioned this movie borrows a lot of ideas from David Cronenberg's The Fly  the dramatic romance sub plot included  but doesn't add any originality from its own. The big difference is that you constantly feel connected with Jeff Goldblum's character in The Fly whereas Dr. Houseman becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible. The rapidageingsyndrome aspect also reminded me of Ruggero Deodato's sadly underrated giallo Phantom of Death only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and didn't inflict it on himself. The physical deterioration of the carriers is very similar in both films though. Few scares or excitement to discover here instead the movie features loads of bad acting poor lighting lousy editing and a completely retarded climax to boot. Feel free to skip this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Metamoprhis' is the story of a dashing young scientist revered at the local college is brought under investigation by financial providers for the college. This forces him to take shortcuts in typical badHollywood melodramatic fashion.My first thought after this movies conclusion was this. Not good but not bad for earlytomid eighties. Of course I then realized that it was made in 1990 which almost propelled it down to a '4' but decided to keep it at the mediocre '5' that it is.'Metamorphis' does on a few occasions seem like a good movie desperately trying to get out. The acting while not stellar is mostly competent. You can even see the occasional glisten of a modest quality. Pacing is a large problem with the movie. After thinking I had been watching for ninety minutes I realized I'd only been watching an hour. Special effects aren't stellar but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness.The lead a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves reminded me mostly of Matt Dillon's character in 'Wild Things'. The female heroine does an OK job but does not distinguish herself in anyway. There's a 'naughty girl' role in here and the actress does what she can with it but it doesn't seem like much. There is a child actor that the director can't decide if he's morose cheerful or just weird. Pacing as I said is the worst problem with this movie until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a Power Ranger blush. It is bizarre and inexplicable until the final scene which is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious saturated with every bad camera trick and overacting that can be compressed in about thirty seconds.A decent onetime watch on the 'Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack'. Nothing that is going to bring you back and nothing to buy on its own.".

Some lady looking into funding of research forces all projects to show what they are doing which leads to Houseman having to hurry things up and inject himself with some serum that may stop people ageing. He's not angry at that chick by the way and they end up in the sack fairly early on in the film. Also this chick has a kid and he looks terrified of all the actors just like that kid who acted alongside The Hoff in Witchcraft. The prof hasn't watched Cronenberg's The Fly remake however although I'm sure Eastman has so it comes as a surprise to him when he's feeling great but having blackouts which involved beating the crap out of Laura Gesmer and then eventually getting worse and worse until it seems like Luigi...I mean George...has replaced half of this film with the last half of Phantom of Death. So he either goes all green eyed or ends up like an ancient old man. And you know that chick has the serum that could cure him...I'll be frank here It's fifty eight minutes into the film before we get our first kill. Nearly an hour! Before then you've a lot of genetic talk romance an old enemy trying to one up our Prof loads of ancient computers and such like. Luckily the acting is pretty bad and it's all neon and eighties like.Thinks finally pick up a bit when Houseman gets even more mutated and starts wasting the cast about time too there's a smattering of gore here but not enough. I'm giving a six because the cheese factor is very high and the two 'twists' at the ending are hilarious and kind of worth all the wait but this is kind of a poor film from an era of poor films.".

Metamorphosis isn't a particularly original or exciting movie it's just kind of there and none of the ideas on the screen here seem to suggest any loftier ambitions than those this release ultimately realized as a prototypical late'80searly'90s directtovideo offering. Nonetheless there's just enough meat here to keep forgiving genre fans engagedand a burst of roaring unintentional comedy awaiting those who stick things out until the final act.The plot owes a large debt to David Cronenberg's masterful take on The Fly the only novel alteration being that this film's protagonistslashantagonist is fixated on a scientific innovation intended to stop humans from aging rather than molecular teleportation though please don't read that comparison as an equivalency neither the action nor the effects in this flick are anywhere near as breathtaking as the material Croneberg summoned a few years earlier. When Dr. Peter Housman is faced with the threat of having the funding for his genetic research cancelled his desperate need for results drives him to act as his own guinea pig and inject himself with his experimental serum. Obviously since this is a horror flick that turns out to be a terrible idea. Rather than making his cells invincible to the ravages of time the inoculation instead imbues him with supernatural strength hey that's not such a bad side effect and causes him to unconsciously prowl the night beating up prostitutes okay yeah that one's bad. Once you factor in the unpleasant matter of his subsequently turning into a deformed monstrosity that feasts on human flesh  it becomes pretty clear that Dr. Houseman isn't nearly as brilliant a scientist as everyone else in the movie keeps saying he is.Since this tale could easily be told in thirty minutes of screentime the film is padded with unnecessary passages that accomplish nothing more than stifling whatever momentum the scenario builds. Houseman's romantic entanglement with a single mom who is sent by the university's moneymen to assess his work is ostensibly intended to mirror Geena Davis's presence in The Fly but this subplot adds virtually nothing to the story other than the opportunity for a dimlylit and wantonly gratuitous softcore sex scene. Other spacefilling mechanisms include needless interludes informing us that the young son of Houseman's inamorata doesn't like him very much which makes sense since he isn't especially likeable and numerous tedious vignettes of the Doctor doing sciencey stuff on his computer to remind us he is in fact a scientist I suppose. There's also far too much time spent squandered on secondary characters who supply jargonfilled extrapolations on the biological causality of the titular transformation though probably meant to clarify Houseman's plight for the audience their accounts only serve to make the entire affair seem more implausible particularly when the explanation the peanut gallery settles upon is that the professor's serum has activated cells that have lain dormant in the human body through millions of years of evolutionin other words mankind's distant ancestors were evidently homicidal reptilefaced bloodbeasts too.The gore effects are far from spectacular but handled capably enough and despite some other criticisms I've read the various stages of Dr. Houseman's grotesque makeover are executed about as effectively as the budget allows. Unfortunately the same can't be said about the penultimate phase of his progression when he mutates into what appears to be a strobelit dinosaur puppet. This monumentally silly reveal renders what's supposed to be the gripping culmination an exhibition of pure slapstick which completely upends the possibility of anyone taking this outing seriouslythough the characters who encounter Houseman's climactic monstrosity gasp with shock and horror any seasoned genre fan will undoubtedly deem laughter a far more fitting reaction. And the chuckles are bound to keep on coming when you get a load of the goofy tackedon twist ending too.Ultimately despite the absurdist heights the film reaches in its last reel the sum total of Metamorphosis as a whole is merely decent. Whether or not that moderate result and a couple of giggles is worth 90 minutes of your time is up to you.".

Can't find this movie on DVD? sure you can! all you have to do is buy the Chilling classics DVD pack! not only do you get Metamorphosis on DVD for 15 but you also get 49 OTHER MOVIES! what a bargain! pff. OK. i'm done advertising for these cheesy movies. let's just say this movie ain't worth the 15 bucks on its own.So we have a chemist scientist. yeah. cause all chemist scientists look as handsome as this guy playing Peter. He's trying to come up with a serum to stop deterioration of the body. the college he works at wants to pull the plug on his project so he tries it on himself. but because this is a horror movie he sucks it up and starts and incredibly long transformation sequence that takes nearly 34 of the movie.To pad out the movie he gets into a relationship with some woman who has a son. and she was never married! scandalous! But of course Tommy is one of the most irritating characters....no. i take it back. HE IS the most irritating character. Far worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over peter's work and gloats over him while he's in the hospital. that's right even as an old cripple you can still be the villain.So we see Peter start to randomly kill some people in visions he has until he realizes he's the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone in his path to get back to normal. However at the end he ends up deevolving into a lizard. yeah i know don't ask. The ending really doesn't make any sense. And if you're hoping for any really good payoff you're not going to get it.This isn't a HORRIBLE movie....it's just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff. if you already own the 50 movie pack and this is next on your list you're not in for a snoozer but you're also not in for a great movie. Just sit back relax and eat a lot of snack food. Because this movie isn't going to be making you jump out of your skin anytime soon.Metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads out of 10.".

Far worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over peter's work and gloats over him while he's in the hospital. that's right even as an old cripple you can still be the villain.So we see Peter start to randomly kill some people in visions he has until he realizes he's the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone in his path to get back to normal. However at the end he ends up deevolving into a lizard. yeah i know don't ask. The ending really doesn't make any sense. And if you're hoping for any really good payoff you're not going to get it.This isn't a HORRIBLE movie....it's just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff. if you already own the 50 movie pack and this is next on your list you're not in for a snoozer but you're also not in for a great movie. Just sit back relax and eat a lot of snack food. Because this movie isn't going to be making you jump out of your skin anytime soon.Metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads out of 10.";

Left alone for two years the university administrators want to know where their hundreds of thousands of dollars have gone  send in Sally Donnelly Catherine Baranov to conduct a full audit  report back Houseman fears his experiments are published before they are perfected. Houseman injects himself with the experimental serum  at first the results are amazing as his health fitness  awareness improve dramatically however soon terrible sideeffects begin to manifest as Houseman's body undergoes a hideous genetic transformation into some form of prehuman reptilian lifeform that must feed on human flesh to survive...This Italian  American coproduction was written  directed by George Eastman who is probably best know for playing the killer in Anthropophagus 1980  Absurd 1981 while Metamorphosis has a bad reputation I didn't think it was a total failure. As has already been mentioned by just about everyone else who has ever seen Metamorphosis the similarities between it  David Cronenberg's brilliant remake of The Fly 1986 are clear to see the scientist conducting risky experiments on himself a neutral love interest the scientist slowly turning into something nasty  experiencing improved strength  senses with a climax where all traces of his previous humanity have gone. In fact the two films are scarily similar in tone  themes even if The Fly is a far far superior film in every aspect. Good mad scientist films are thin on the ground really there's the aforementioned The Fly there's the ReAnimator films  that's just about it really. I liked the ideas here some of the scientific exposition is dry  dull but I liked the story it's based around proper people with proper motives rather than dumb teens even if they act dumb quite a lot there's enough going on to have kept me interested  the story takes the odd turn here  there. The script takes itself extremely seriously with not one bit of humour or irony even attempted. At over 90 minutes Metamorphosis is slow going at times which hurts it  the extremely silly twist ending doesn't work at all although it might have looked clever on a written page as a script it doesn't work when filmed.The gore levels are restrained compared to some Italian horror there's a rippedout throat there's a few dead bodies a few girls are knocked around  there's a heart in a jar. The special effects are alright the makeup is OK until the very end  the final reptilian creature is shown director Eastman wisely keeps it's screen time down to a minimum films from waist up  uses quick cuts to try  disguise how bad it looks he fails as the thing looks so stiff  rubbery. Metamorphosis looks OK it's a pretty dark film with the climax set in dark university corridors to try  raise some scares but Eastman doesn't quite manage it. I did like the look of this overall a bit flat  static at times but with a certain atmosphere. Also known as Regenerator here in the UK when it was released back in the 90's on VHS.Filmed in Norfolk in Virginia the film is set against a Christmas backdrop for some reason maybe it was coming up to Christmas when it was shot so had to included Santa's on the street  decorated Christmas tree's. The acting is a little dry at times but not too bad.Metamorphosis is something a little different it tries to be a complex science fiction horror ripoff of The Fly  the basic idea is here but the execution lets it down. A little too slow not quite enough gore a poor looking final monster  a very silly twist ending makes me wonder why I liked it. Well I don't know but I did for all it's faults  it has it's fair share.".

And then immediately after this the prologue has the hero metamorphosed into a small lizard in a child's box. I'm sure Franz Kafka never envisaged any of this.The film is also notable for being written and directed by George Eastman who is famous to most fans of Italian genre cinema as an actor who usually plays convincingly psychotic sociopaths in films such as Rabid Dogs. This flick clearly isn't in the same league as that one and it is an indicator of the reduction in quality of Italian films in general by 1990. The fact that it's most memorable moments are of unintended ? hilarity perhaps says it all. Although in fairness to Metamorphosis its good fun and at least it actually has something memorable about it which is more than can be said for many similar pictures.".

Metamorphosis plays like a low rent version of David Cronenberg's The Fly which it is. A brilliant young scientist uses himself as a test subject undergoes a radical change in cellular structure and attacks his girlfriend. Sound familiar? Well let me save you some time by telling you to just watch The Fly again. One interesting fact about the film was that it was written and directed by George Eastman. If you don't recognize that name you obviously don't follow Italian cinema. He's starred that's right he's an actor in such classics as After the Fall of New York Bronx Warriors and Warriors of the Wasteland. But this is the only film he's officially directed. And I can't say that it's directed badly or even scripted badly. It just doesn't try to become its own movie. And on top of that there is the acting and the effects. The acting is a bit shoddy from everyone especially the kid. I know child acting must have its difficulties but HOLY CRAP!! People hate that kid. And the effects aren't terrible...up to a point and you will know that point. The big reveal during the finale is such a let down. The scientist turns into a big rubber dinosaur.

At the onset of this drag when I was having these thoughts though someone may have gotten killed or have mutated however as noted the gore and effects weren't very good. What made matters worse was that the scene transitions were confusing example first Dr. Houseman would be at the Zoo then he'd have a flash back about possibly killing someone finally he'd wake up in a cold sweat in bed making the audience ask Was he dreaming he was at the zoo?. Like the movie's pace these scene transitions got progressively worse.I could try to say the character development of Dr. Houseman was pretty good but towards the end of the film that is once you've seen what the Doctor has metamorphosed into hopefully you'll laugh which really is the only reason to see this movie at least once this movie unintentionally runs like a longwinded joke.The costume of the um thing that Doctor Houseman becomes can also be seen in Joe D' Amato's Quest for the Mighty Sword which was made in the same year.

Thus no one is safe Borat takes on Jews blacks gays feminists middleAmericans religious fanatics frat boys. The only weapon against the bumbling Borat is a sense of humour which this movie shows most Americans painfully lack. Indeed if there is any message to be had from Borat and I'm not sure there is much of one beyond its fascinating cultural experiments it's that everyone needs to lighten up and not take themselves so seriously.The image of Americans projected in this film varies from the heartwarming to the downright frightening. New Yorkers threaten Borat with physical violence when he approaches them on a subway. Feminists walk out on him when they find his views on women too much to tolerate. Folks out in the heartland commiserate with him over his hatred of gays and Jews a gun shop owner even helps him pick out the best weapon for shooting Jewish people. A sweet Jewish couple give him a place to sleep and bring him a homey meal that is before they turn into invading cockroaches. A group of manic Pentecosts help him find Jesus. An RV full of frat boys make complete asses of themselves by espousing their hopelessly illinformed views on minorities in our country and the need to revert to slavery. The majority of people treat Borat in the condescending way of those who want to think of themselves as being culturally aware without really knowing anything at all about other cultures. These people become rude the second Borat offends their sense of propriety. On the other hand the disenfranchised of America greet Borat with open arms and we see a group of gays and a group of blacks interacting with him as if no cultural boundaries existed at all. The film's sweetest and most unexpectedly so moments come from Borat's befriending of a black prostitute.Of course this is a carefully crafted work of fiction and Cohen only lets his audience see what he wants them to see. I would probably react much the same as many of the people in this film if this crazylooking and sounding man appeared out of nowhere and began to antagonize me. But the movie does make Americans look like a bunch of awfully selfimportant uptight stiffs and I've been to enough places in this country and met enough people to realize that the way events play out in this film even if they are manipulated or staged probably come very close to the real thing.Thank God for movies like Borat. If nothing else they remind us that our cultural boundaries only matter as much as we let them and that all of the fears that govern political correctness are mostly ungrounded. After all virtually every person in this film was offended at one point or another and as far as I can tell all of them lived to tell about it.Grade A".

This movie is satire and if you don't understand that then there's absolutely no point in watching.Much like Spike Lee's Bamboozled it is made very clear that this movie is a satirical piece. Their lampooning spoofing however you want to put it there just kidding around take that in account before you go mad because Borat makes jibes at women and Jews.Cohen has once again had me in tears with laughter as he examines the American way of life. If you haven't seen any of Cohen's TV material then you will definitely be shocked by what you see.Cohen manages to create genuine laugh out loud moments. Yes they are often at the expense of others but so what?!? No one was harmed during the making of this movie and if they didn't want to be involved they didn't have to sign the release forms. But beyond the laughter Cohen does hit a political nerve whether you like it or not. The footage of a Texan talking about Gays and immigrants is both humorous and extremely alarming. As is the conversation between three frat boys who clearly have the social intelligence of a two year old combined. It's a stark realisation to see the backwards world we are still living in.If satire eludes you then this movie isn't for you but if you can sit back relax and really take in whats going on and have the cop on to realise that Cohen isn't Borat Cohen comes from a strict Jewish background then you will be able to take this movie at face value.Remember ITS SATIRE! Rent it now and just sit back and enjoy the ride!".

	schema:reviewBody "Many people have practically no idea who Sacha Baren Cohen is besides his small role as the gay French Nascar driver in 'Talladega Nights'. This is because the show he had Da Ali G Show was a very unpopular show. Mainly because it was on HBO and late hours of the night. Unfortunately many people never watched the show not because they didn't like it but because they didn't know it existed. Da Ali G Show was an incredibly original varietyreality show featuring Cohen in three roles including Borat whom is the main character of the movie. Cohen posing as these different characters would interview politicians and such who were unaware the interview was a joke. The reactions Cohen would get out of people including one politician telling him to 'go fck himself' were priceless. Going into the onemonth early sneakpreview of 'Borat' I was expecting a funny movie but was skeptical on how funny the movie would be. Usually film adaptations of short five minute skits don't work so well examples include 'Superstar' 'Night at the Roxbury' 'The Ladies Man' and 'Coneheads'. All are pretty much loser movies with a few funny scenes but not much more. However when the ending credits started to roll and I walked out of the 'Borat' screening I was sore from laughing so hard. To be honest I never laughed so hard during a movie in my entire life.There is not much I can tell you about this without spoiling it for you. Basically the plot is a Kazakhstan news reporter taking a trip to the United States to win the love of Baywatch's Pamela Andersen whom he thinks is a virgin. HA! All I will tell you is that Borat travels across the country from New York to L.A. doing such crazy stunts as taking a dump in front of the Trump Towers publicly masturbating in front of a NYC Victoria's Secret store singing an AntiAmerican Kazakhstan National Anthem at a rodeo in Nebraska buying weapons to protect himself against 'the jews' whom he believes were responsible for 911 Terror attacks and trying to kiss just about every guy he sees which brings about homophobia in many of the real people featured in the movie who don't know it's a movie. Some may call 'Borat' the funniest film ever made and that's not and understatement.'Borat' is without a doubt one of the most original and ingenious comedy in the last three years and maybe just maybe the funniest film ever made. Grade A screened at Harkins Arrowhead 18 Glendale AZ 90406".

	schema:reviewBody "'Borat' is both a comical and offensive movie that tackles the 'American' way of thinking with a touch of humour. The title character's take on pretty much every sensitive issue such as Judaism homosexuality feminism prostitution racism fanaticism and ignorance. The film balances its portrayal of Americans quite well There are the kind hearted who treat Borat with kindness The Jewish Couple there are those who threaten to use violence when he attempts to hug them The New Yorkers those who look down upon him The Texans those who in a split second turn against him the rednecks... But Borat's interaction is conducted with a sense of comedy. The humour is crude explicit disgusting and even brutal at times but there are a number of sequences that had me laughing out loud such as Borat's experience with the 'gypsy' the feminist group the wellmeaning Jewish couple the bear... The BoratLuenell track is among the sweetest moments. I think what the film tries to remind us is that people should lighten up and not take everything too seriously. While I enjoyed most of the American adventure I did not like how poor Kazakhstan was 'torn to shreds'. A makebelief country could have easily been done with instead of having to offend an already existing country. As stated earlier some of the 'comic' tracks are a bit too far fetched till the point of being revolting like the hotel nude fight between Borat and Azmat. Thus this brings the film down a notch in my view.".

The three guys talking about women between beer and beer was so horribly real that I wanted to leave the theater laughing and screaming at the same time. Borat is not tender about his own background either. He is an equal opportunity offender if I ever saw one. The world is a cesspool and nobody is immune. Even his innocence is corrupt. I've been considering seeing it again as the whole thing in one single disgusting lump was too much to take but I'm not sure I want to. I'll wait for the DVD where I'll be able to select and discard. My only question is now what will Sacha Baron Cohen do for an encore.".

	schema:reviewBody "Borat proves to be the Python of our generation. I say this as a diehard Monty Python fan  not because the humour is on the same level or follows the same guidelines in fact the common ground is here is that it follows no guidelines  but because both comedy teams mask their sketches in a feature film passing them off as a story when it becomes glaringly clear that the latter is an elaborate pretext under which to have outrageous absurdist and sidesplittingly fun in a series of genius gags.Yet for all of Borat's subsequent disorganisation and warped narrative we are first served a gorgeously condensed introduction to our character in his village in Kazakhstan. This segment was possibly the biggest crowdpleaser in my theatre and perhaps rightly so for I would call it the film's goldmine in terms of sheer laughoutloud humour. Here we are introduced to Borat's sister She is numberfour prostitute in whole of Kazakhstan. whom he kisses on the mouth his main interests pingpong sunbathing and watch ladies make toilet as well as a wide variety of hilarious native Kazakhs. Undoubtedly the success of the introduction stems from a combination of novelty and a culture shock.Once the sprawling surge of Kazakhstani culture subsides Borat flies to New York City to make a moviefilm about the glorious US and A. The booming Russian ethnic score melts into Harry Nilsson's Everybody's Talking' At Me and the film gets ambitious it spoofs Jon Voight's incongruous cowboy character walking down Manhattan in Midnight Cowboy 1969. This I found a pleasant surprise but the referential spoofs end here and the rest is all Sascha Baron Cohen  and we couldn't be happier.The second half of Borat is arguably less compelling. It is hard to tell why for the humour remains consistently good and there is an almost exponential stupidity with our Borat character as the sets out to go to California to marry Pamela Anderson. I would not go as far as to say the novelty wears off but we are a little more settled now and Borat has found his safe footing. Next however the film totally floors whatever safeness you may have with one of the most unspeakably graphic hotel room scenes I have ever seen. I won't give anything away but rest assured that some viewers males will watch in horrified silence while others will literally cramp up from laughing so violently. I belong more to the latter category.As Borat travels through America there is a wealth of juxtapositions to be found when he interacts with the people  members of the white house television broadcasters etiquette teachers Christian fundamentalists and Jews  all offers layered hilarity and a consistent cloud of laughter kept hovering in the air. Sadly it was not always directed toward Borat but most of the time but toward some truly idiotic hick Americans. When I was informed the film used many candid takes I can only hope the unreasonably creepy Jesus convention was not one of them.In conclusion Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan 2006 is a towering comedy achievement. It is apparent that Sascha Baron Cohen has done something truly cool here and has created an antisemitic misogynist and bigoted character that aptly embodies all racy taboos. As an actor he is unmistakably brave and uninhibited which makes it easy for the film to lose itself in a tornado of gags spoofs bizarre oneliners and graphic jokes. The most fun I've had in a theatre since...forever!!!9 out of 10".

	schema:headline " The World through the Eyes of Borat and Sacha Baron Cohen";
	schema:reviewBody "Chances are this poet was pulling double duty when the English comic Sacha Baron Cohen shot footage of his character 'Borat' in my hometown of Savannah Georgia. At the time several years ago I was completing the Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance while also serving as a caregiver. What do you suppose Mr. Cohen was busy doing? Basically he was serving up his unique brand of cultural satire by walking fully suited with cameraman in tow into a shower room full of totally unclothed Savannah Gnats baseball team members. That particular footage wound up on Cohen's 'Da Ali G Show' DVD featuring his portrayal of the wannabe Jamaican Londoner gangsta rapper Ali G. Since I missed greeting Cohen when he visited my fair city as well as Atlanta Charleston and other southern venues writing a review of his outrageously iconoclastic movie 'BORAT Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' seems like a southerly hospitable thing to do to make up for it.As I watched 'BORAT Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' I squirmed with discomfort scowled in outrage and laughed my western civilized butt off. What I didn't understand was why. The answer came later just as I was drifting off to sleep and the following thought popped into my head Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat only appears on the surface to ridicule Women Jews and African Americans''and also seems to make light of such serious issues as incest homophobia and extreme social retardation. Beneath that hilarious surface he is actually lampooning the realworld bigotry ignorance and hypocrisy that pushed the global village into the state of chaos it occupies today. Please note that Cohen himself is Jewish and often uses his grandmother's praise of his humor as defense for his crude and brazen style of satire. It is Cohen's gift as a performer that he can project at the same time both a relatable sense of vulnerability and an excruciating sense of offensiveness. We can call that genius but we can also call it true to life.At its ground zero level this movie is satire of the highest and most deadly kind because it does more than simply exploit subconscious fears and social taboos. It smashes them right in the viewer's face such as when Borat excuses himself from the dinner table of his genteel white South Carolina hosts only to return with his refuse in a bag. As if that is not enough to freak out this goodoldboy family he invites a black prostitute played by the beautiful Luenell to join them and is promptly evicted from the house along with her.Or take for an equally scandalous example the now infamous naked wrestling scene with Borat and Azamot courageously played by Ken Davitian. It would have been enough for most viewers to see the two knock each other out and then watch the movie fade to another scene. But that would have restricted the nude battle royal to the hotel room and our naked clowns would not have been able to literally show their asses in public''as some people tend to do with their clothes on.Like Monty Python Peter Sellers Saturday Night Live alumni and Richard Pryor before him Cohen is a master satirist who takes no prisoners. 'Borat' the character may be an innocent Kazakhstanian abroad in America but Sacha Baron Cohen the man is clearly a critical observer of humanity intent on exposing the laughable and the painful absurdities of what is supposed to be our civilized technologicallyenhanced modern life.As a writer one has to admire Cohen's ability to create fascinating characters and build entire movies around them. Borat is only one of three cultural types that he has unleashed utilizing the machinery of Hollywood hype running at full throttle. Although often annoying to the extreme his Ali G character was appealing enough to help pave the way for the movie Borat to gross some 259 million dollars to date. With that kind of box office power what's the reaction likely to be when his gay Austrian fashioncritic character of Bruno takes over the big screen? Before answering too quickly it might be worth considering that Cohen reportedly has already signed a 42.5 million deal with Universal Pictures for the film.

	onyx:emotionText "Chances are this poet was pulling double duty when the English comic Sacha Baron Cohen shot footage of his character 'Borat' in my hometown of Savannah Georgia. At the time several years ago I was completing the Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance while also serving as a caregiver. What do you suppose Mr. Cohen was busy doing? Basically he was serving up his unique brand of cultural satire by walking fully suited with cameraman in tow into a shower room full of totally unclothed Savannah Gnats baseball team members. That particular footage wound up on Cohen's 'Da Ali G Show' DVD featuring his portrayal of the wannabe Jamaican Londoner gangsta rapper Ali G. Since I missed greeting Cohen when he visited my fair city as well as Atlanta Charleston and other southern venues writing a review of his outrageously iconoclastic movie 'BORAT Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' seems like a southerly hospitable thing to do to make up for it.As I watched 'BORAT Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' I squirmed with discomfort scowled in outrage and laughed my western civilized butt off. What I didn't understand was why. The answer came later just as I was drifting off to sleep and the following thought popped into my head Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat only appears on the surface to ridicule Women Jews and African Americans''and also seems to make light of such serious issues as incest homophobia and extreme social retardation. Beneath that hilarious surface he is actually lampooning the realworld bigotry ignorance and hypocrisy that pushed the global village into the state of chaos it occupies today. Please note that Cohen himself is Jewish and often uses his grandmother's praise of his humor as defense for his crude and brazen style of satire. It is Cohen's gift as a performer that he can project at the same time both a relatable sense of vulnerability and an excruciating sense of offensiveness.

But there were so many other scenes where I felt like I was going to pass out from the pure ridiculousness of it all. Again Cohen cleverly draws out the ignorance of so many people from the U.S. and A. and we're left shocked humbled more aware and having stomach pains from the hilarity of how he does it.

Sacha Baron Cohen deserves some sort of acting award because many of the scenes were done live no rehearsal no script and Cohen stays perfectly in character throughout. His sense of comedy and timing is very good. I won't divulge many details because that might lessen the fun.Yes it is a little meanspirited at times. The insulting of a pastor's wife is discomfiting. But most of the time what we are watching is Borat the boob and the hilariously incorrect things that he does. It reminded me of National Lampoon's Vacation with Chevy Chase. Borat is the same kind of clown who always manages to say the wrong thing at the wrong time to the wrong people. There are a lot of decent laughs in the movie and a few for which Borat should be spanked.I would recommend buying the DVD if you've got some money to spare.".

	schema:headline " Totally imperfect but packing one of the best character performances ever";
	schema:reviewBody "For months I could not go anywhere see or read anything without hearing something about Borat Cultural Learnings of American for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. It was being hailed as groundbreaking and hilarious beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Everyone I knew wanted to see it and I just stood back and could not understand what the big fuss was about. Yeah it looked fairly amusing but nothing more than that. Sacha Baron Cohen's Da Ali G Show never impressed me when I watched random episodes so I was not in belief that this film would.But with all of the hype it made me want to see it opening weekend. Unfortunately I never managed to. I caught it a few weeks later without the benefit of a huge audience watching it with me. And for the most part I think my original assumption was correct.Basically for the two people who have zero clue what the movie is about despite it now being on DVD Borat Sagdiyev Cohen is a Kazak journalist sent to the United States to observe the American way of life. He brings his TV crew with him every step of the way and begins to explore the country. But because of his origin he is outrageously obnoxious in his behaviour. But for some reason it only becomes more tolerated as he continues on allowing for many surprising responses from the people he comes across.The satirical idea for the film is simply brilliant. The character of Borat is racist misogynist raunchy and just downright vile in the way he acts. And the Americans he talks to either do not realize what is going on or actually agree with him. The tour he takes across the United States involves a plethora of random everyday citizens being duped in this fashion. The fact that the film was marketed so well in the US and then further made millions attests to the idea that this may just be the greatest practical joke every played.But unfortunately it is a onenote joke. The film loses steam after thirty minutes and can barely pick up afterwards. It strikes a pretty solid barrier and just cannot recover no matter how hard it tries. Yes the proceeding minutes had their share of laughs and shocks but nowhere near as much as the first little bit. It just sets itself up far too well and fails to live up to its original design. Its nifty idea and execution really should have told people from the start that it would not work for a ninety minute long film but I guess they had more faith in the picture than I did.Another upsetting thing about the film was the grand amount of preplanning. It was continually being sold to the audience as being spurofthemoment and very uncoordinated. But as the film progresses you can tell that some moments are actually being filmed this way and that some reek of being rehearsed. It takes away from the satire the film had built up for itself and really brings down the genuine enjoyment for the film. I know it had barely anywhere to go from the start but making it almost so that it was written unnaturally before hand just takes away from the genuine impact that the film has. The fact that the writing was nominated at the Oscars also does an effective amount of damage to the final moments of the film which otherwise would have been drop dead funny instead of just amusing.The filmmaking techniques on the other hand are just magical. You really get a sense of the gritty and grungy documentary look the filmmakers wanted from the minute the film starts right up until its finale. The handheld camera works beautifully in every sequence and the very personal diary feel that the film gains during the second act works very well. Just trying to keep up with Cohen in certain scenes seemed to have been a test of endurance on its own. The film is very low budget and it shows in how unique the film looks. If it had not been so heavily publicized I think I actually would have had trouble deferring whether or not it was an actual documentary if I saw it while flipping through TV channels.There are no proper words to describe Cohen and his schtick. It really is a sight to marvel all on its own. His dedication and perfection in this role is nearly unheralded in my mind. He goes beyond transcending himself into the character. Every moral fibre of this character is ingrained in Cohen's performance. You do not see Cohen and you do not see an actor. You see a rude and ignorant Kazak journalist. He never lets up for a second and is always acting in character. This fictional character is brought to life with so much energy that he actually forms into a real life person. The line between reality and fiction is just so thin here that it really begs the question of how far an actor will go for his character. And he is absolutely hysterical to watch.Ken Davitian who plays Borat's producer and sidekick Azamat is also very good in his performance. He is almost always watching and is so subtle. He never breaks a smile and he is just so serious that he complements how perfect Cohen's character is. He is obviously not as strong an actor and is barely understandable but his valiant efforts do go rewarded.Even with its flaws Borat is an experience everyone should take. Some may find it funnier than others and some may not find it funny at all. There is a bit of a middle ground but not much. And in the process of watching everyone will be able to marvel at one of the greatest character performances ever committed to celluloid.7.510.".

Prepare yourself for scenes of naked men wrestling each other into suggestive pornographic positions. In short the 3 or 4 genuinely funny scenes in this movie aren't worth the other disturbing parts.During the movie Borat asks what is appropriate and funny here in America. I think we must ask the same question. Is seeing Borat show off a family photo of his teenage son's penis really funny? Or does his advice to the town rapist about sticking to humans only really merit a laugh?The audience left the theater dismayed. And my last thought wasn't about a particularly humorous scene but rather about whether this movie was really funny at all. I HIGHLY don't recommend this movie! Don't waste your time money or energy on this one.The most surprising thing about that film is that it was only rated R. The MPAA website defines an NC17 rating as one that most parents would consider too strong in inexcessive violence sex aberrational behavior drug abuse or any other elements and therefore off limits for viewing by their children. What parent would take their kids to this movie?!? I certainly didn't see anyone bring their children unless they're children were adults. What keeps this movie from being called pornographic is no doubt the legal process that's required.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sacha Baron Cohen's film Borat is being used as a litmus test. If you like the film you are hip cool and part of the new incrowd immune to the silly dictates of common decency and Political Correctness.If you don't like Borat you are an old fuddyduddy or spinster schoolmarm.I laugh at dead baby jokes. I was a nurse's aid and then a Peace Corps volunteer and I learned to laugh at death bodily fluids pusfilled sores and intestinal parasites.I cannot tell you how much I hated Borat. I would have walked out but I had to keep watching because of my field of study.Based on reviews I expected a penetrating edgy critique of Political Correctness that would make me laugh out loud. I did not laugh once. Full disclosure others in the theater did. I'd like to offer you samples of what passes for humor in Borat but if I did so this site would not run my review. That's because just about every joke   not just some of them but just about every one   is made at the intrusively graphic expense of women or homosexuals andor it involves bodily excretions.An example. Baron Cohen is a guest at the home of a genuinely charming woman. After defecating he hands her his fecal matter. That's a big joke. If you are laughing now this movie is for you.In another scene Baron Cohen without any clothing on at all wrestles with another undressed man who is grotesquely obese. During this wrestling match they assume poses for activities I can't name if I did this site would not run this review. If jokes at the expense of fat homosexual men are your cup of tea this movie is for you.I've never seen such a hateful movie in a mainstream theater. Again I know full well that I sound like a schoolmarm when I say that. Sacha Baron Cohen I would have to guess based on this movie hates the human race including you the ticket buyer. He is willing to exploit everyone he encounters to humiliate them on camera to get you the ticket buyer someone he also hates to laugh at others' suffering. Once you do that he can laugh at you. If watching decent people doing their best to deal with an obnoxious creep is your cup of tea then this movie is for you.I feel like repeating over and over I laughed at Todd Solondz's Happiness. I laugh at politically incorrect humor. And I hated this movie.There's more going on here and I know I'm risking a lot by pointing this out.Borat speaks Polish. Only speakers of Polish will get that. He says Dzien Dobry jak sie masz dziekuje and other Polish phrases. The film's opening and closing scenes were shot in a real Eastern European village. Real Eastern European folk music is played on the soundtrack.With Ali G Baron Cohen exploited vicious stereotypes of Blacks. With Borat Baron Cohen is not targeting Kazaks. He's exploiting a centuriesold contemptuous and hateful stereotype of Eastern European peasants that can be found in various Western cultures  witness the American Polak joke   and is common in one thread of Jewish culture. In this stereotype Poles and by extension Eastern European Christian peasants are like Borat ignorant bestial and disgusting. A good prcis of the stereotype can be found in a famous passage in Isaac Bashevis Singer's The Slave. It can be found in the Golem article on my website.In fact Borat has a lot in common with Marian Marzynski's controversial film Shtetl. In both cameras invade an impoverished Eastern European peasant village. Villagers who are not sophisticated or worldly are conned into appearing on camera to perform for us as if they were trained monkeys. We laugh at them or feel disgust at them because they are dirty because they are poor and because they keep pigs. In any case gazing at these lesser peasants we know that we are superior. Perhaps Baron Cohen will try this technique next in a Darfur refugee camp or a homeless shelter. Poor unsophisticated people can be so amusing.Baron Cohen speaks of women as if they were less than dirt. Don't misunderstand him. He's not mocking misogyny. He's milking misogyny. The things Baron Cohen says about women in this movie are grotesque they are brutal. He makes fun of mentally retarded people. He makes fun of white Christian Southerners a group everyone feels safe mocking.Reviews and no doubt many viewers are telling you that Borat is a fearless laugh riot that punctures political correctness and makes you laugh till you cry. It's that very description that made me want to see it. I thought I'd be getting something like the Colbert Report.I've gotta think I'm not the only one though who found looking at Baron Cohen's hatred for an hour and a half to be an icky profoundly unfunny experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "When this film first came out in 1980 I remember going to see it on opening night. The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing The Shining was enough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for an entire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me which is what still happens every time I rent the video for a rewatch. I have seen The Shining at least six or seven times and I still believe it to be simultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yet funniest films I've ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarily effective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation convex lens shots to enhance surrealism and meticulously scored music to bring tension levels to virtually unbearable levels. And funny because of Jack Nicholson's outrageous and in many cases adlibbed onscreen antics. It never ceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one both a comedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacing nature haunt much of the first half of the film which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity but that is little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is more implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels but is basically about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece the likes of which have never been seen before or since. Highly highly recommended.  Paul".

	schema:headline " A truly brilliant and scary film from Stanley Kubrick.";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't praise this film long enough!The Shining is without doubt one of Stanley Kubrick's undisputed masterpieces and a true classic in horror cinema. It is a film that over the course of the years has managed to scare the living hell out of its audiences and still does. The film is an adaptation of Stepehen King's original novel written in the late '70s and although the film is not very loyal to the book it still stands as a thing of its own.Right from the beginning as we contemplate the car going to the hotel from those stunning aerial shots deeply inside us we know that something in the film somehow sometime is going to go wrong. As we obtain that severe warning an almost inaudible voice gently whispers to us 'sit tight' a sense of unexpectedness invades us all and it is that very same feeling that makes our hair stand on end throughout out the entire movie.The plot is simple Jack Torrance Jack Nicholson becomes the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in up in the secluded mountains of Colorado. Jack being a family man takes his wife Shelley Duvall and son Danny Lloyd to the hotel to keep him company throughout the long isolated nights. During their stay strange things occur when Jack's son Danny sees gruesome images powered by a force called 'the shining' and Jack is heavily affected by this. Along with writer's block and the demons of the hotel haunting him Jack has a complete mental breakdown and the situation takes a sinister turn for the worse.The film unlike many horrororiented films nowadays doesn't only rely on stomachchurning and gory images which it does contain anyway but on the incredibly scary music based on the works of Bla Bartk and on the excellent cinematography the Steadicam is superbly used giving us a sense of everfollowing evil as well. The terrifying mood and atmosphere of the film is carefully and masterfully woven by Kubrick who clearly knows how to really make a horror movie.Jack Nicholson's powerful performance as the mad father and husband is as over the top as it is brilliant.

	onyx:emotionText "I can't praise this film long enough!The Shining is without doubt one of Stanley Kubrick's undisputed masterpieces and a true classic in horror cinema. It is a film that over the course of the years has managed to scare the living hell out of its audiences and still does. The film is an adaptation of Stepehen King's original novel written in the late '70s and although the film is not very loyal to the book it still stands as a thing of its own.Right from the beginning as we contemplate the car going to the hotel from those stunning aerial shots deeply inside us we know that something in the film somehow sometime is going to go wrong. As we obtain that severe warning an almost inaudible voice gently whispers to us 'sit tight' a sense of unexpectedness invades us all and it is that very same feeling that makes our hair stand on end throughout out the entire movie.The plot is simple Jack Torrance Jack Nicholson becomes the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in up in the secluded mountains of Colorado. Jack being a family man takes his wife Shelley Duvall and son Danny Lloyd to the hotel to keep him company throughout the long isolated nights. During their stay strange things occur when Jack's son Danny sees gruesome images powered by a force called 'the shining' and Jack is heavily affected by this. Along with writer's block and the demons of the hotel haunting him Jack has a complete mental breakdown and the situation takes a sinister turn for the worse.The film unlike many horrororiented films nowadays doesn't only rely on stomachchurning and gory images which it does contain anyway but on the incredibly scary music based on the works of Bla Bartk and on the excellent cinematography the Steadicam is superbly used giving us a sense of everfollowing evil as well. The terrifying mood and atmosphere of the film is carefully and masterfully woven by Kubrick who clearly knows how to really make a horror movie.Jack Nicholson's powerful performance as the mad father and husband is as over the top as it is brilliant. Shelley Duvall who plays the worrying wife who tries to help her son is also a stand out she shows a kind of trembling fear in many scenes and is able to display weakness and vulnerability in a very convincing way. Undoubtedly The Shining is full of memorable moments the elevator scene or the 'Heeeeeere's Johnny' oneliner for instance and simply put it's flawlessly brilliant.Stanley Kubrick's direction is pure excellence giving the whole film a cold and atmospheric look thus creating an unbearable sense of paranoia and terror.

	schema:reviewBody "Chilling majestic piece of cinematic fright this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot an icecold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a redpoker through a human eye as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds with only the circumstances of the moment and the reasons given therein needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas the clackityclacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies continuity errors and set misarrangements that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based but without that as a comparison point I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit but then again I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film so maybe I should keep my twocent criticisms over a superb film to myself. All in all this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its coldeyed view of the man's mind gone overboard creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.Rating 910".

	schema:headline " Fact Kubrick is better than King";
	schema:reviewBody "It's well know that Stephen King doesn't like Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining so much so that he scripted an abysmal TV movie version. According to him Kubrick didn't understand the horror genre. Well I think Kubrick did. I think he understood it only too well. He knew that it was a genre full of conventions cheap tricks and tired clichs. Therefore Kubrick decided to throw all that nonsense out of the window and make a film based on atmosphere rather than predictable thrills. You don't get people here jumping out of the dark time after time. You don't get worthless shocks. Kubrick's version of The Shining is an insidious film. It gets under your skin. In other words it isn't for Pavlovian dogs that have spent a lifetime being conditioned by cretinous nonsense.What runs deepest through The Shining is a frustration with family. Right from the beginning it's obvious that Jack isn't happy with his lot  as he's being shown around the hotel he can't help but take a sneaky look at the backsides of a couple of women. Well can you blame him? The poor man is married to a bugeyed bucktoothed Olive Oil lookalike.Then there's Jack's quiet frustration with his son Danny. As he's driving to the hotel he's bothered by requests for food. And then his son makes out that he's knowledgeable because he saw a programme on TV. Already he's slightly irked  he's got to spend months alone with these people one who resembles Popeye's missus and one who talks to his finger.So really the hotel brings out nothing that isn't already there. It merely brings everything to the surface  Jack's resentment as regards his wife his frustration as regards his lack of writing talent and his annoyance at having a troubled son. It's kind of like he's testing his family. Are they strong enough as a unit to survive being cooped up together?One of the underlying themes in the film seems to be television. What happens in The Shining is what happens when someone stops watching the idiot box. With it a person can find solace in mindless programming and retreat from the strictures of family life. Without it they're faced with all their problems and all the failings of their loved ones. Even the strongest family can be brought to its knees when there's no escape from each other's company. Therefore it's quite telling when Jack loses the plot completely that he spouts lines from TV Honey I'm home and Here's Johnny. Just watch some television Jack.But it's also the pain of writing that contributes to Jack's insanity. There's nothing quite as harrowing as an empty page. Plus there's nothing more annoying than being interrupted midflow. One of the best scenes in the film is when Jack tells his wife to get lost when she interrupts him. It's extremely violent in how cold Jack is towards Wendy. And because it's grounded in a reality it's all the more effective.Also rather unsettling is the scene where Jack talks to his son. He makes Danny sit on his lap and he proceeds to tell him how much he loves him and how he'd never hurt him. It works so well because it's so cold and because there's such an obvious lack of affection. The words are just empty platitudes. They mean absolutely nothing.Jack's true feelings are only revealed when he gets to talk to Lloyd. It's in this scene that you realise the marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be  Wendy has never forgiven him for accidentally hurting his son. And it's also in this scene that you realise as if you hadn't noticed earlier that Jack is absolutely crackers. He's talking to ghosts. But they could also be figments of his imagination for there are mirrors behind most of the ghosts he talks to. Effectively he's talking to himself. And I love this matter of fact way of dealing with the supernatural. There are no fancy tricks. Everything just seems unnaturally natural.In fact everything to do with the ghosts is superbly handled. The twins are spooky Lloyd is amiable and Grady is out of his mind. And it's Grady who's probably the most chilling presence in the film. He starts off as a bumbling waiter but then quickly becomes a stone cold killer. Just the way he says 'corrected' conveys more terror than a million slasher films. And Philip Stone's performance is a million times more subtle than Nicholson's. I mean as much as I like Jack in the film he does chew the scenery. But Kubrick likes his over the top performances so that's the way he wanted it.And undoubtedly it's Kubrick's movie. He's the real star. And I love everything he brings to the film. I love his command of lighting  just look at The Gold Room scenes. I love his use of music. I love the way that he turns the Room 237 scene one that could have been a standard 'jump' scene into a comment on Jack's marriage  his willingness to be unfaithful. I love the way that he leaves lots of unanswered questions. I love the shots of the blood coming out of the lift. I love the helicopter shots at the start. I love the way that pages and pages of typed words are the most frightening visual in the film. I love the maze. I love the fact that you see a ghost getting a blowjob from a ghost in a bear suit Man I love absolutely everything about this film. It's horror for people who know that true horror isn't being stalked by a man in a mask but being trapped alone with your family.".

	schema:reviewBody "What can I say about the scariest movie I have ever seen that has not already been said by others more articulate than yours truly?  Do not view this film expecting to see a screen version of the Stephen King novel. Rather this is a Stanley Kubrick film and to fully appreciate it one should judge it within the context of Kubrick's entire body of work as a serious filmmaker.  Thematically THE SHINING relates most closely to 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY though flourishes of PATHS OF GLORY A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON do manage to figure prominently in the film's overall technique.In a nutshell no pun intended Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall costar with Oregon's Timberline Lodge  enlisted to portray the exterior of the Overlook Hotel  in a story that appears on the surface to be about ghosts and insanity but deals with issues of child abuse immortality and duality. What the film might lack initially in terms of coherence is more than made up for in technique.  Garrett Brown the male voice in those old Molson Golden commercials inventor of the Steadicam chases young Danny Lloyd through hotel corridors and an amazing snow maze providing magiccarpetride fluidity to scenes that ten years earlier would have been impossible to accomplish.  If the film starts off too slow remember who the director is.  This man likes to take his time and the results are well worth it incredible aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel horrific Diane Arbusinspired twins staring directly at us portentous room 237 and its treasure trove of terrible secrets elevators that gush rivers of blood in slowmotion Jack Torrance's immortality found via the hotel akin to David Bowman's journey through the Space Gate and some of the best use of preexisting music ever assembled for a motion picture.It would take a book to examine and defend the film's strong points and drawbacks.  If you've never seen it you owe it to yourself to watch it alone with the lights off with no interruptions and make sure that it's raining.  This is a cinematic experience that changed my life at the age of 14.  Makes a great double feature with Robert Wise's 1963 thriller THE HAUNTING.".

Rather this is a Stanley Kubrick film and to fully appreciate it one should judge it within the context of Kubrick's entire body of work as a serious filmmaker.  Thematically THE SHINING relates most closely to 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY though flourishes of PATHS OF GLORY A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON do manage to figure prominently in the film's overall technique.In a nutshell no pun intended Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall costar with Oregon's Timberline Lodge  enlisted to portray the exterior of the Overlook Hotel  in a story that appears on the surface to be about ghosts and insanity but deals with issues of child abuse immortality and duality. What the film might lack initially in terms of coherence is more than made up for in technique.  Garrett Brown the male voice in those old Molson Golden commercials inventor of the Steadicam chases young Danny Lloyd through hotel corridors and an amazing snow maze providing magiccarpetride fluidity to scenes that ten years earlier would have been impossible to accomplish.  If the film starts off too slow remember who the director is.  This man likes to take his time and the results are well worth it incredible aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel horrific Diane Arbusinspired twins staring directly at us portentous room 237 and its treasure trove of terrible secrets elevators that gush rivers of blood in slowmotion Jack Torrance's immortality found via the hotel akin to David Bowman's journey through the Space Gate and some of the best use of preexisting music ever assembled for a motion picture.It would take a book to examine and defend the film's strong points and drawbacks.  If you've never seen it you owe it to yourself to watch it alone with the lights off with no interruptions and make sure that it's raining.  This is a cinematic experience that changed my life at the age of 14.  Makes a great double feature with Robert Wise's 1963 thriller THE HAUNTING.";

	schema:reviewBody "When Jack Torrance Nicholson is offered a job as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel he accepts it as an opportunity to work on his novel in an isolated environment. He is told stories of the last caretaker going mad and butchering his family but isn't deterred. He arrives at the Overlook Hotel with his wife Duvall and child Danny Lloyd and is shown around the hotel by the cook Scatman Crothers who has the gift of perception. The cook warns Danny that the hotel can be of particular danger for those with the gift. It's only a matter of time before Jack begins to act increasingly erratic.This is one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles his increasingly unhinged character is amusing and terrifying in almost equal measures. Duvall plays the role of the terrorised wife quite well  she does look like she's genuinely filled with fear  but doesn't have much else to do. Lloyd is excellent as the boy although he doesn't have too much emotion to express. However no doubt that this is Jack's show.The story doesn't stick to King's novel and is better for it this is Kubrick's Shining. The film has plenty of genuinely scary moments but manages to keep a creepy atmosphere all through  especially as the ghosts come out and Jack begins to move between his reality and the reality that is gradually claiming him.Kubrick is excellent here his cold direction adds to the overall creep factor of the film. It's one of the best examples of his masterful touch.Overall this is an excellent horror movie  because the focus is on horror and fear rather than gore alone as with modern horrors. Jack is excellent in one of his best roles ever and the whole package is delivered in a cold creepy manner by a sadly lost director.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Shining you know what's weird about this movie? This is the movie that everyone for people who claim to not like horror films will always say that The Shining is a terrific film. This is Stanley Kubrick's classic vision of Stephen King's horror tale of madness and blood. This is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not you have heard of it know a few lines from it and know some of the classic images. Who could forget Jack's Here's Johnny!? Who could forget All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy? Who could forget that chilling ending? This is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is Kubrick's best work. I know there is a lot of argument in that department a lot of people say it's 2001 A Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr. Strangelove but if those film pioneered film making then The Shining perfected it. This is the tale of isolation madness terrifying images and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin. Jack Torrance Jack's son Danny and Jack's wife Wendy arrive at the Overlook Hotel on closing day. The elderly AfricanAmerican chef Dick Hallorann surprises Danny by speaking to him telepathically and offering him some ice cream. He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift they called the communication shining. Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel particularly Room 237. Dick tells Danny that the hotel has a certain shine to it and many memories not all of them good and advises him to stay out of room 237 under all circumstances. Danny's curiosity about Room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened. Danny shows up injured and visibly traumatized after Jack tells Wendy that he loves his family. Seeing this Wendy thinks Jack has been abusing Danny. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd. Danny starts calling out the word redrum frantically and scribbling it on walls. He goes into a trance and withdraws he now says that he is Tony his own imaginary friend. Jack sabotages the hotel radio cutting off communication from the outside world but Hallorann has received Danny's telepathic cry for help and is on his way. Wendy discovers that Jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy formatted in various ways. Horrified Jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen. Jack converses with Grady through the door of the locker which then unlocks releasing him. Danny has written REDRUM in lipstick on the door of Wendy's bedroom. When she looks in the mirror she sees that it is Murder spelled backwards. Jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters. Here's Johnny! and Jack's legendary image is born.The Shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares. Jack Nicholson's performance is timeless and unforgettable. But one I also feel is extremely overlooked is Shelley Duvall her scene of finding Jack's rant All Work is incredible that's a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad. Also another incredible scene is when Jack sees a ghost woman in the bathtub it's honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema. The reason this film is so well known is because it's a film of perfection it's been on The Simpsons it's been shown in other films and it's a film that will forever stay with you when you see it trust me.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay okay maybe not THE greatest. I mean The Exorcist and Psycho and a few others are hard to pass up but The Shining is way up there. It is however by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. It's better than The Stand better than Pet Sematary if not quite as scary better than Cujo better than The Green Mile better the Dolores Claiborne better than Stand By Me just barely though and yes it's better than The Shawshank Redemption shut up it's better I don't care WHAT the IMDb Top 250 says.  I read that a couple of decades ago Stanley Kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie and from the other room his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration. Finally she didn't hear any noise for almost two hours and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something I tell this with all due respect of course she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand and the book was The Shining. And thank God too because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever.Stephen King can be thanked for the complexity of the story about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing. Jack Nicholson can be thanked for his deadon performance as Jack Torrance how many movies has Jack been in where he plays a character named Jack? as well as his flawless delivery of several nowfamous lines Heeeeeere's Johnny!!'. Shelley Duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to Jack's desires to kill her. Stanley Kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls.One of the most significant aspects of this movie necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect is the isolation and it's presents flawlessly. The film starts off with a lengthy scene following Jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter. This is soon followed by the same thing following Jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel. This time the scene is intermixed with shots of Jack Wendy and Danny talking in the car in which Kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of TV as Wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of Danny who says that it's okay because he's already seen it on TV See? It's okay he saw it on the television.'.The hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place and it's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge echoing rooms and the long hallways. These rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie and Kubrick's traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy threedimensional feel. Early in the film there is a famous tracking shot that follows Danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his Big Wheel is that what those are called? and his relative speed as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner. And being a Stephen King story you EXPECT something to jump out at you. I think that the best scene in the halls as well as one of the scariest in the film is when Danny is playing on the floor and a ball rolls slowly up to him. He looks up and sees the long empty hallway and because the ball is something of a child's toy you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him. Anyway you get the point. The Shining is a damn scary movie.Besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn't suck The Shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. HAD Jack always been there like Mr. Grady told him in the men's room? Was he really at that ball in 1921 or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? If he has always been the caretaker as Mr. Grady also said does that mean that it was HIM that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters and not Mr. Grady after all? It's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied that's just mediocre filmmaking. For example The Amityville Horror which obviously copied much of The Shining as far as its subject matter did this. But it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think as mostly all of Kubrick's movies are. One more thing that we can all thank Stanley Kubrick for and we SHOULD thank him for is for not throwing this book against the wall. That one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was wellacted and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining quite possibly the scariest movie ever.The movie follows a writer Jack Nicholson and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent and the rooms are huge yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walkin refrigerator.The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie but is definitely a goodie. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was wellacted and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining quite possibly the scariest movie ever.The movie follows a writer Jack Nicholson and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent and the rooms are huge yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways.

	schema:reviewBody "I shall never ever be able to understand the phenomenon known as Stanley Kubrick. When he was on as with DR STRANGELOVE he was brilliant. But when he was bad he was awful.I saw THE SHINING in its first release in a packed movie house in New York City. I had read and loved Stephen King's novel I am widely read in the horror genre and do not scare easily but that book gave me the creeps for weeks.Well for all the people who have been raving what a masterpiece this film is I can only tell you this. The crowd in the theatre started giggling the minute Jack Nicholson appeared on film and by the time he chased Shelley Duvall up the stairs the whole crowd was literally in stitches. And I was laughing right along with them. Maybe New York audiences are just jaded I don't know.Not that this movie does not have some scary moments. Shelley Duvall is rather good when she is away from Nicholson and it starts to dawn on her that something evil is taking over her family and her life. Unfortunately Miss Duvall plays Wendy Torrance a strong intelligent and resourceful woman in the novel as a pathetic whiny ninny most of the time and by the time Nicholson had her trapped in the bathroom I am sure plenty of us were screaming for her head. It must be said that this is not the fault of Miss Duvall a talented and intelligent actress who according to reports fought bitterly with Kubrick over his interpretation of Wendy.The kid talking to his finger is another idiotic and unintentionally hilarious bit of business that was not in the original novel. Why Kubrick thought this was a good idea is beyond me.But let's get down to the real problem Jack Nicholson. In the right role he can be very good though he has never been among my top ten. Jack Torrance is totally the wrong role for him for one thing he does not look ordinary enough. But the worst thing is that Stephen King's story was about a man being SLOWLY AND INEXORABLY driven out of his mind. Nicholson goes nuts so early in the film that there is literally nowhere for him to take the character. And Kubrick was either in awe of Nicholson who was still riding the postOscar high from CUCKOO'S NEST or he just didn't care or he thought it was scary when it was actually funny. I don't know.As if all this were not bad enough the whole mess drags on for two hours and twentytwo minutes this movie practically cries out for a pair of scissors.Some people will feel that I have spat on an icon I suppose and they have that right. But Stephen King himself was not happy with this film and when he finally got the opportunity to redo it as a television miniseries in 1997 the results were much better. For the one thing that is missing in Kubrick's version is a heart.Anne Rivers Siddons in discussing her excellent horror novel THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR writes that the thing about horror is that it smashes people and relationships. Thus the best horror stories are at bottom also very sad Brian De Palma's CARRIE gets this Kubrick's film does not. And whatever your feelings about the miniseries format may be the Torrance family created in 1997 were people you could care about. Director Mick Garris understands King better than Kubrick did and Rebecca De Mornay in particular redeems the Wendy character in a spectacular tourdeforce towards the end. In 1980 the Torrances were figures of fun. Rather like the barbaric Victorian custom of laughing at the lunatics in Bedlam.Awful awful awful.".

I decided I would look up the plot and watch some clips so I wouldn't be caught offguard by anything and I could just appreciate the characters directing cinematography etc. Despite knowing everything that would happen the film was unbelievably engaging. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Jack Nicholson of course steals the show with one of the most iconic performances ever and the other actors were decent but the real star was Kubrick himself. Every shot every set the sound design and everything has his fingerprints all over it and it is such a delight to watch. When Jack advances up the stairs demanding the bat from Shelley Duval I grinned from ear to ear because everything in that moment was just perfect in film.The movie like all others has problems. In my opinion the Grady girls and the bloody elevator do not hold up. I knew they were coming from the summaries I had read so I knew what to expect so the only reason I could see them as being scary or unsettling is if the viewer was caught offguard. If you're pretty feminist you're not going to like Shelley Duval's character as she is a pretty weak character.All in all this film is fantasticallymade a cinematic and acting delight and a gripping horror film that is considered a classic for a reason.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is probably the most overrated movie of all times. I'm not a huge horror fan and I get scared very easily but this movie actually made me laugh or sigh in despair about the lengthiness of the scenes and the predictability of the plot. I read the novel when I was a teen and it beat the crap out of me I still am afraid of bath tubs in hotel rooms embarrassing but true. The novel is an all time favourite of me and when I read all the great reviews about Kubick's Shining I was really looking forward to see the movie. What a mistake. For all lovers of the book this is not a book adaptation Kubick made his own story...unfortunately. Not only does Dick Hallorann get murdered by Jack  the fact he survives in the novel was one of the reasons I loved the book so much it has after all somewhat of a happy ending  but even worse Kubick turned the whole story around and twisted it to an extend where the original plot is hard to recognize. Jack Torrance is very obviously a mad man right from the beginning who very openly hates his wife and kid so as others have pointed out before why didn't he leave his family or killed them before. The whole point of the novel the normal guy and loving father with a hang to alcohol who gradually gets brainwashed by appearances in the hotel gets totally lost. One might wonder why the movie even needs the whole hotel plot if Torrance is already mad as a hatter from the very beginning. Apart from this I guess had I not read the novel I would probably not understand one bit of what was going on with the characters. But unfortunately that's not all. Also the performances of Nicholson and Duvall were so lousy it really crept me out. I've never seen Jack Nicholson perform so badly he seemed like a parody of himself and don't get me started on Shelley Duvall. Periodically I thought I watched some amateur actor in a school play. Her adaptation of Wendy Torrance was so annoying I was staggered between the wish of seeing her chopped to pieces and the wish to see her survive and protect her little boy. The character Wendy in the novel is a strong resourceful person the Wendy in the movie is a whiny weak and extremely stupid person. The fact that she lays down and sleeps while she is trapped with her 'sick' son and a mad man in a hotel with no contact to the outside world is beneath me. The ending is probably the worst part of the entire movie on the one hand it's ecstasy as the film draws to an end on the other hand it is as far from the original plot as can be which in this case is an extremely bad thing. The only actor that impressed me was Danny Lloyd apart from the fact that Kubick partly tried to turn him into a parody of Regan MacNeil I think he did a fantastic job for the little six year old boy he was to that time. He seemed like the only natural actor on the scene. All in all this movie was by far the biggest disappointment I've seen for a long time. Save your time better read the book.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's certainly not a new complaint in relation to this film but I must register it anyway Jack Nicholson's acting here is all wrong for the material. Instead of a slow buildup from banality to insanity  which given the movie's otherwise brilliant creepiness of tone and style  could have been truly horrific to watch we get Jack Torrance as the nutjob Big Bad Wolf right from the very beginning. It's weird it's as if Kubrick is indeed making the ultimate horror film and Nicholson is sabotaging it every step of the way by enacting the ultimate horror film parody. Each on its own terms is immensely enjoyable but they effectively cancel each other out. I've never seen the styles of director and star diverge so emphatically A minor comparison would be the first Fletch movie where Michael Ritchie's taut direction is appropriate to a gritty crime thriller but where star Chevy Chase waltzes through the vehicle glibly throwing darts into every dramatic setup.However there's no point in blaming Nicholson for the mess  this was clearly the way Kubrick wanted the part to be played. Perfectionist and control freak that he was you don't believe for a minute that any inch of a Kubrick film isn't exactly how he wanted it he certainly wouldn't allow a mere actor to steamroll his welllaid plans not even one as forceful and magnetic as Jack Nicholson. Still this movie  together with Batman and even One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest  soured me on Jack for a long time I found in him an actor far too willing to coast on his personality and to ham it up mercilessly rather than bother to actually create a recognizable human being. Such a technique is fine even commendable for farceurs like Jim Carrey or Paul Reubens either one of which would probably have been just as effective as Nicholson is here at being Jack Torrance but we should expect more from our socalled Dramatic Actors. It wasn't until I saw some of his more restrained nuanced work in such films as Ironweed Wolf The King of Marvin's Gardens and even amazingly Easy Rider that I realized what a truly fine performer Nicholson can be when he is forced to as it were paint in between the lines by the way no complaints from me about his Oscar for As Good As It Gets  he's the only actor alive who could have made that part work the way it did. It's just too bad Kubrick didn't decide to use him this way watching Jack Torrance go from a diffident restrained man watch the first part of Wolf to see how surprisingly well Nicholson can play such a character to a rampaging lunatic would have been truly frightening even with the extra bit of campiness Nicholson throws in  Heeere's Johnny! etc. It would have been as if the Overlook Hotel unleashed some primordial demon from the depths of an essentially decent man. The way it plays now Jack's evil and insanity are loudly telegraphed from the very beginning those dancing eyebrows of his NEVER stop!  all that's left is to go through the motions.Of course there are some pretty startling motions to go through in this movie Kubrick's technical brilliance and his ability to create an engrossing mise en scene ensure that the film can never be seen as a total failure. In fact when Nicholson is offscreen the goosebump factor here is actually pretty high. The long tracking shots of Danny riding his Big Wheel through the winding hotel corridors are justly famous as is the very design of the Overlook's wide open  yet paradoxically oppressive  map room where Jack does his writing these sequences effectively make the Overlook into a character itself. The isolation of it its stillness and quiet and most importantly its labyrinthian hugeness serve to overwhelm the tiny family and break down whatever bond they may have which again would have been so much more effective if we felt this family was ever bonded in the first place. Kubrick ingeniously avoids shock devices for the most part and creates his spooky atmosphere through an almost inhuman stillness and quiet  which effectively creates an undertow of dread and expectation in the viewer. Quite simply there are images and flashcuts in this movie that will get under your skin and that you will never be able to shake  they will haunt your subconscience forever deliciously. None more so than the truly classic moment where Wendy the wife finally discovers what it is Jack has been writing all this time I can think of few movie moments in history that are so gutbustingly hilarious and at one and the same time so bonechillingly frightening and perverse. For this one moment alone the film demands a viewing.It's simply too bad that Kubrick felt the need to invade the sanctity of his gothic cathedral like setting with the over the top rantings and ravings of the town lunatic. Not that that lunatic is not one devil of a fun guy to hiss and laugh at it's just that he belongs in a different movie  the Evil Dead flicks maybe or one of Freddy Krueger's opuses. This conflict in styles between star and director ultimately make The Shining for me at least a frustrating experience I keep wishing one of them would just get out of the other's way. The Shining could have been one of the hammiest and most enjoyable grand guignol horror experiences ever or it could have been perhaps the most finely crafted and subtly shaded psychological thriller of all time. Alas it cannot be both  and in trying to do so it effectively undermines itself at every turn.".

The way it plays now Jack's evil and insanity are loudly telegraphed from the very beginning those dancing eyebrows of his NEVER stop!  all that's left is to go through the motions.Of course there are some pretty startling motions to go through in this movie Kubrick's technical brilliance and his ability to create an engrossing mise en scene ensure that the film can never be seen as a total failure. In fact when Nicholson is offscreen the goosebump factor here is actually pretty high. The long tracking shots of Danny riding his Big Wheel through the winding hotel corridors are justly famous as is the very design of the Overlook's wide open  yet paradoxically oppressive  map room where Jack does his writing these sequences effectively make the Overlook into a character itself. The isolation of it its stillness and quiet and most importantly its labyrinthian hugeness serve to overwhelm the tiny family and break down whatever bond they may have which again would have been so much more effective if we felt this family was ever bonded in the first place. Kubrick ingeniously avoids shock devices for the most part and creates his spooky atmosphere through an almost inhuman stillness and quiet  which effectively creates an undertow of dread and expectation in the viewer. Quite simply there are images and flashcuts in this movie that will get under your skin and that you will never be able to shake  they will haunt your subconscience forever deliciously. None more so than the truly classic moment where Wendy the wife finally discovers what it is Jack has been writing all this time I can think of few movie moments in history that are so gutbustingly hilarious and at one and the same time so bonechillingly frightening and perverse. For this one moment alone the film demands a viewing.It's simply too bad that Kubrick felt the need to invade the sanctity of his gothic cathedral like setting with the over the top rantings and ravings of the town lunatic. Not that that lunatic is not one devil of a fun guy to hiss and laugh at it's just that he belongs in a different movie  the Evil Dead flicks maybe or one of Freddy Krueger's opuses. This conflict in styles between star and director ultimately make The Shining for me at least a frustrating experience I keep wishing one of them would just get out of the other's way. The Shining could have been one of the hammiest and most enjoyable grand guignol horror experiences ever or it could have been perhaps the most finely crafted and subtly shaded psychological thriller of all time. Alas it cannot be both  and in trying to do so it effectively undermines itself at every turn.";

	schema:reviewBody "How this film gained such high praise and notoriety completely escapes me. I have seen hundreds of films and this is easily the most incoherent bland and lifeless piece of work I can recall seeing especailly by such a renowned filmmaker. And yes I hated 2001 A Space Odyssey as well. Long drawnout boring lifeless film packed full of irrelevant imagery and symbolism that amounts to a filmmaker who doesn't know how to tell an intelligent story with solid characters and emotions. That is the same exact problem here.First off Shelley DuVall added nothing of value to the film. She was blah from beginning to end. No endearing qualities whatsoever. The whole film was a failed experiment thinking that random creepy irrelevant images coupled with an incoherent story progression devoid of any character arcs would be successful. Kubrick had no sense of scene transitions. He shows no ability to allow one scene to flow into another to give it fluidity or convey that he has an overall consistent vision. The inconsistency over what aspect ratio he intended for it is further proof that he had no concrete vision in my honest opinion. A solid competent talented director knows what they want and are very confident in their visions. They have a very clear idea of how they want things viewed by every audience everywhere. That's why directors and DPs hate it when their films are put into the panandscan format. Kubrick also fails to have his DP shoot or light 98 of the scenes intriguingly. Watching this it was like watching an old TVmovie  dull uninspired and lifeless. Yeah the steadicams and dolly shots are all impressive but sometimes scenes seem to exist just to show off the cool camera moves they can do. Scenes which contribute absolutely nothing to the overall film in any aspect. Being a filmmaker myself I am of the belief that every scene should have a purpose to either the plot or characters of the film. Anything else is a waste. And beyond those steadicam and dolly shots it's essentially bland for nearly the entire film. Almost zero interesting angles and amateurish editing skills. Yawn inducing cinema.Good story progression would show Jack Torrance starting out as a well adjusted happy family man that gradually descends into complete psychosis and homicidal mania. Instead Kubrick shows him as already a man dissatisfied with his life marriage son and career. Then Kubrick just flashes a title card on the screen saying 'One Month Later' and Jack is already deteriorated towards the verge of madness. That's shoddy storytelling and a hack's idea of executing a character arc. No cause is given to why he becomes a homicidal maniac. There's also no correlation between all the surreal nightmarish imagery. It's completely random and doesn't evolve into revealing a story behind its origins. All this surrealism is just an excuse for it to be labeled 'horror' as it doesn't serve an underlying purpose as to why anything is happening amongst the characters. They don't confront deal or resolve the reasons or purpose behind it all. It's just there to make the film bizarre.Now I don't mind methodically paced films as long as there's a purpose to it all. Any talented editor could make this a much more effective film by chopping a good 35 minutes or more out of it. Horror films require momentum to equal good pacing and good pacing is necessary for solid tension. Still even if there was tension and good pacing fact is really there are no endearing characters in this film for me to build any sympathy for. I don't care what happens to them because they're one dimensional emotionless weakwilled people. How this family could even coexist for five minutes is beyond me let alone how they survived a more than three hour drive up to the hotel in the first place.This film is almost complete trash because it shows the filmmakers have no intelligence or coherence for the movie they were attempting to make. There are enormously better conceived and executed films from this time that proved far more effective. If you want isolation and paranoia check out John Carpenter's The Thing. If you want surrealism go rent Don Coscarelli's original Phantasm.".

He is one of those directors who produces very long boring movies that move at a snail's pace and are really difficult to withstand for more than a few minutes at a time. Movies such as 2001 A SPACE ODYESSY DR. STRANGELOVE and SPARTACUS are examples of this kind of movie.As many other commenters have pointed out Stephen King didn't like this movie because it was not faithful to the book. In fact he hates it so much that 15 years or so after he made his own movie entitled STEPHEN KING'S THE SHINING. I've never seen the other version. But anything with his name attached is normally worth watching so I'll at least make the effort to track it down. It really couldn't be any worse than this tripe churned out by Stanley Kubrick.I've heard THE SHINING being referred to as scary terrifying masterpiece classic thrilling horrifying and so on. Yeah right! This movie does not even come close to producing anything equating to those words. The only horrifying thing about it is how it became so popular.Where can I start with the problems of this movie? Let's start with Jack Nicholson. I thought Jack Nicholson was great as The Joker in Tim Burton's BATMAN but in this he doesn't even seem to be acting. He plays a character who is supposed to become insane as the story progresses. Yet it is very clear from Jack's first scenes that his character has already got a few screws loose. And that stupid Here's Johnny! line. Was it supposed to be scary? Funny? What? Who knows? It was just downright stupid as far as I'm concerned. Yeah I know it was a reference to Johnny Carson but what's Johnny Carson got to do with this movie? The answer absolutely nothing at all.And Shelley Duvall. What can I say about her? She looks like Olive Oyl from the POPEYE cartoons. How ridiculous! Somehow the viewer is expected to believe that her character and Jack are married with a kid. Yeah right! There is no chemistry between the two actors at all.Finally Scatman Crothers. I have great respect for this actor. He appeared in TWILIGHT ZONE THE MOVIE and it was one of the very dull segments. Yet his superb performance gave it credibility and the story touched upon my emotions. In THE SHINING however Mr. Crothers is there just to be killed and I don't suppose he was bothered about his character being killed off considering how lame the movie is. It was probably just a paycheck used to pay off a few debts. And the ridiculous thing is that the character in question never dies in the book.I honestly can't believe that people think this movie is better than classics such as THE EXORCIST THE OMEN and THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE. But yet this movie has a higher IMDb rating and is sitting very comfortably on the top 250 chart. Nonetheless that won't alter the fact that the three mentioned movies put THE SHINING to shame any day.Stephen King's SALEM'S LOT was infinitely superior to this movie. Personally I think the director of that movie Tobe Hooper should have been asked to direct THE SHINING. We would have had an infinitely superior movie. Trust me. I've seen plenty of Mr. Hooper's movies and he very rarely fails to disappoint. THE FUNHOUSE was a low point of Mr. Hooper's career but even that movie looks like Oscarworthy material compared to THE SHINING.Overall I would not recommend this at all. I've not seen STEPHEN KING'S THE SHINING so I can't really recommend it just yet. But I would recommend checking out some proper horror movies such as SALEM'S LOT PSYCHO THE EXORCIST THE OMEN THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE just to name a few.".

However I hate to say that is the ONLY good thing about this movie.  The woman can't even remember her name is one of the worst actors I have ever seen.  She was just annoying and I was pleading with the movie for her death.  The little boy in his slobbering fits made me just want to puke.  No the only good thing about this movie was Nicholson.The plot is not too bad but is to be honest very lame.  He is a caretaker and must take care duh of the hotel during the winter it's closed season. He takes his wife and child to live up there.Nothing happens for the longest time.  It is just such a boring movie.  I was so sick of it by the time Nicholson started losing it.  By the way he loses it for no reason.  The movie doesn't explain anything.  I've never read the book so I'm guessing you'd have to read the book to understand ANYTHING.  The kid has a magical talent or something called the Shining but this has nothing to do with the movie!  I was at a total loss!There's a rather grotesque scene involving a naked woman that really made me want to shut this off.  But something drew me in... I guess I just wanted to see how bad it could really get.Whoo I wish I didn't do that.It just gets worse and worse after that.  The plot falls short with tons of holes the storyline is absolutely boring and crooked and the climax is TOTALLY predictable.  I knew that the black guy would go up to the hotel get killed and the woman and child would take the vehicle and escape.The music is so horribly screechy that I just wanted to clap my ears and cause deafness every five minutes.  But I guess it fits the grotesque atmosphere of the movie.I was utterly disgusted by this movie.  If this is supposedly the best of horror I will never want to watch the horror genre again for fear of seeing its worst.".

I was at a total loss!There's a rather grotesque scene involving a naked woman that really made me want to shut this off.  But something drew me in... I guess I just wanted to see how bad it could really get.Whoo I wish I didn't do that.It just gets worse and worse after that.  The plot falls short with tons of holes the storyline is absolutely boring and crooked and the climax is TOTALLY predictable.  I knew that the black guy would go up to the hotel get killed and the woman and child would take the vehicle and escape.The music is so horribly screechy that I just wanted to clap my ears and cause deafness every five minutes.  But I guess it fits the grotesque atmosphere of the movie.I was utterly disgusted by this movie.  If this is supposedly the best of horror I will never want to watch the horror genre again for fear of seeing its worst.";

Boy was that a mistake? I gave up trying to read King's dense narrative that seemed to be all over the place leaving it aside so that I could remember the effectiveness of Kubrick's screenplay. Only much later did I learn that Kubrick's script deviated markedly from King's novel. Well I guess that's art...There are many striking features about the film. First who would expect to see a true horror movie shot mostly in bright daylight and at such an idyllic setting? Quite the opposite to all the Dracula type schlock that had been so common and that graced cinema screens up till then. Recall Psycho from 1960... The effect for me was to make the narrative all the more horrifying.Did I say idyllic setting? More like modern Gothic in a way. Or maybe Kubrick was subtlety poking fun at prior socalled horror flicks that had the inevitable dark castle sitting on hill with lightning crashing around most of the time?And then there's Jack Nicholson one of Tinsel Town's eccentrics if not crazy playing a role tailor made for him. How could it not be after seeing how well he did in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest 1975? Some might argue he was over the top a caricature almost of a man who truly goes insane. Watching him for the second time however I think his performance reminded me all too well of insane people I've met in real life.As a study in abnormal psychology I think it works very well  in fact it's a tour de force. And that's why I'm still also a mite disappointed by the way the narrative turns to use supernatural elements to explain the reasons for Jack's descent into his private Hell. I suppose I'll have to read King's novel to sort this out. I'm prepared to accept the idea of telepathy between young Danny Danny Lloyd and Dick Scatman Crothers because I've come across situations that strongly suggest its probability. I see no need however to introduce the supernatural except to appeal to the gullible.Shelley Duval is well cast as the already nervous wife Wendy and I read that Kubrick made her even more nervous with his need for perfection. Scatman was suitably impressive and mysterious a fine actor and composer. And hats off to young Danny Lloyd.If this is a movie you've missed I recommend it thoroughly.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Shining starts with Jack Torrance Jack Nicholson driving to an isolated hotel named the 'Overlook' situated high in the Colorado mountains for an interview with it's manager Stuart Ullman Barry Nelson about becoming the Winter caretaker. Ullman tells Jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh Winter sets in. Together with his wife Wendy Shelley Duvall  young son Danny Danny Lloyd Jack moves into the hotel  at first everything seems fine it's a beautiful hotel absolutely huge  whatever they need is at their disposal. However the Overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide  Danny has the ability to 'shine' which means he has psychic powers that let him see  hear things 'ordinary' people can't. As the days weeks  months begin to pass Jack become more  more insane Danny keeps 'seeing' things  people while Wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what's happening to her family as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped Jack finally loses it...This English production was cowritten coproduced  directed by Stanley Kubrick  is a fine horror film. It appears that The Shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions  the one I will be commenting on is the shorter European cut that runs just under 2 hours in length. The script by Kubrick  Diane Johnson is based on the novel by Stephen King which I have not read so I can't compare them goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film. There are very few character's in The Shining with Jack Wendy  Danny the only ones that really matter since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them become involved with them  what they go through. The pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long  keeps you interested throughout. On the negative side I don't think the reasoning behind Jack going crazy  wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me the fact that Jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me  I don't know if I missed something but that ending didn't make any sense to me whatsoever I'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about! There is very little in the way of violence or gore a couple of rotten zombie ghosts  someone is killed with an axe but The Shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood  special effects as it has a gripping story. With a budget of about 19000000 The Shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as Kubrick the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic freeflowing  smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character's around the maze of corridors the sets look absolutely real  instead of clichd old haunted house themes like dark corners basements  cobwebs Kubrick brings things right uptodate with brightly lit corridors massive open expansive spaces  a modern decor well 80's modern just check that red toilet out!. The acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying  Nicholson seems crazy from the very start. The Shining is an absorbing film that I enjoyed watching although I'm not sure I'd watch it again anytime soon. For those looking for explosions  fancy special effects you will be disappointed for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story I definitely think The Shining is for you well worth a watch in my humble opinion.".

The only explanation I can come up with is the responses are affected by what I can the Genius Effect and time. The Genius Effect which I'm sure someone else probably has coined  but if not I'll take credit! would dictate that if the filmmaker is a genius then the film is a work of genius and must be excellent. Since I don't consider Kubrick a genius I don't think all he had done was great. Some of it was OK probably the best was FULL METAL JACKET but I digress. I do think this point has some merit because reviews of Eyes Wide Shut were very good and very recently it was revealed that Kubrick himself thought it was bad see Guardian Unlimited Film httpfilm.guardian.co.uknewsstory0188807700.html.The other effect time is more of what I remember people saying when the movie first came out. There were many comments that it shouldn't be considered a horror film but rather a comedy because audiences were laughing more than screaming and not just at the funny moments i.e. Here's Johnny!. It seems audiences are more kind as time goes by or at least in this case anyway.The acting in this film is absolutely atrocious especially that of Shelley Duvall which one IMDb user stated is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all. That's because it isn't. It is flat and unemotional even when she tries to be emotional. Jack Nicholson doesn't become crazy due to isolation he's nuts from the beginning. His character's dealing with his wooden family doesn't beg the question Why does he want to kill his family but Why didn't he do so long before this? Not saying I condone injury to the dull and irritating but being locked up with those two would put anyone's nerves on edge. I can't believe they survived the car ride to the hotel.Needless to say I didn't find THE SHINING scary in any way even when I saw it at age 11. By then I had the wits scared out of me by a far worse movie IT'S ALIVE gimme a break I was 7. After that I have yet to be scared by any other movie and THE SHINING never even came close.In all honesty I have tried to give THE SHINING a reasonable chance. I've seen it more than five times thinking I must be missing something. Each time it gets worse.".

His legacy is to take a good laugh and make life an easier one by understanding how to use the positivity to have a sense of humor!I have seen from Uncle Buck to Planes trains and Automobiles and John is talented. Even the series CAmp Candy as cartoons for the environment was putting the C in cool. After all at least he did something about it...Do we?This movie is a must for a good slapstick and a no brainer just what you need after a hard day work...";

I laugh every time I watch this movie. I can say that about very few films.Annie Potts is beautifully cast as the moneyhungry sexcrazed nymphomaniac Tim Thomerson of Cherry 2000 was great as the idiot you love to take advantage of and Jeffrey Jones of Howard the Duck was beautiful as the conniving hardhearted megalomaniac but it was Shawnee Smith who stole the show.

A comedy should have some logic to it even if the logic is thin but this script doesn't come close to making the grade. I have reviewed over 500 movies for magazines and newspapers and 'Who's Harry Crumb?' ranks near the top of the list with such losers as 'Spies Like Us' and 'Assault on Paradise'. It doesn't come near the comedy that Candy generated in 'Uncle Buck' 'Planes Trains and Automobiles' and 'The Big Outdoors.' Don't waste your time watching this dud.".

I have reviewed over 500 movies for magazines and newspapers and 'Who's Harry Crumb?' ranks near the top of the list with such losers as 'Spies Like Us' and 'Assault on Paradise'. It doesn't come near the comedy that Candy generated in 'Uncle Buck' 'Planes Trains and Automobiles' and 'The Big Outdoors.' Don't waste your time watching this dud.";

The shenanigans in which the family and its associates are engaging seem like they could be the plot on their own. But anyway this is nice brainless humor at its finest especially the scene in the vent. Too bad that John Candy died so young.

	schema:reviewBody "However I still thought this John Candy was rather funny. Sure it has sort of the same premise as the first Fletch movie mixed with a few new ingredients but it works for me in a way. John Candy plays the title character a person who comes from a long line of great detectives who is a bit of a bad bumbling type detective. So yes this film adds a bit of Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau into the mix as well. Well there is a kidnapping that has occurred as a wealthy man has one of his daughters taken in some sort of spa and for reasons that would be revealed later the private investigator that has been hired gets Crumb on board. The lead police detective on the case does not really care for this but the father at this point is desperate. The father is married to a new wife and the step mom in this case is a bit of a flirt to put it lightly. Harry immediately has suspicions that it is her so while he is kind of doof he is also somewhat intelligent as his suspicions of her are not totally without warrant. During his investigation he dresses up and pretends to be some rather oddball characters to try and find the missing girl. It is nice that the movie does not really feature a love interest for Crumb as that would have been a bit awkward instead he kind of teams up with the younger daughter but it is strictly a friends only type deal. So in the end I thought this film was a rather good and funny John Candy movie probably one of my favorite of his where he is the main star and he does not have any real back up like having Dan Aykroyd in The Great Outdoors or Steve Martin in Planes Trains and Automobiles.".

	schema:headline " Definitely one of the weaker points in the career of the talented and missed John Candy";
	schema:reviewBody "Who's Harry Crumb? is a title I have now been familiar with for a few years and I original came across that title simply due to John Candy's starring role in the film. I was only 7 years old when that renowned comedian passed away and I never heard his name until probably several years later. It wasn't until over a decade after his premature death when I finally discovered how talented he was by seeing episodes of SCTV and the 1987 John Hughes film Planes Trains  Automobiles. However I was obviously in no hurry to see Who's Harry Crumb? since it's been probably about five years since I first heard of it and I've finally just seen it for the first time. This is not one of Candy's more popular movies and unsurprisingly not one that I like.Jennifer Downing is the daughter of a millionaire named P.J. Downing and one day during a mud massage at a health spa she is kidnapped! When P.J. seeks help from the Crumb  Crumb detective agency Eliot Draisen the president of this agency puts Harry Crumb on the case. Harry comes from a long family line of skilled detectives but unfortunately he hasn't inherited the skills of his predecessors. Although this man means well he is actually a very clumsy and incompetent detective and there's a good chance he will louse up this mission! He begins his investigation not knowing that the reason why Eliot put him on the case is because the president of Crumb  Crumb is secretly behind this kidnapping of the young heiress so he actually wants the investigation to fail! Eliot is well aware of Harry's incompetence and feels that with him on the case there's no chance that the mission will be a successful one! In this 1989 crime comedy John Candy plays a kind of character he was very well known to play a clumsy but wellmeaning and kindhearted one. He sure was good at this role but didn't always play it in good movies. This film is unfortunately one of the unfunny ones he starred in. Near the beginning the part where Harry crashes through the window of an arguing couple made me laugh a little and what is perhaps the funniest part takes place very shortly after that when the incompetent detective accuses a woman named Mrs. MacIntyre of having an affair with her own husband! However I don't think I laughed at all after that apart from one scene much later in the film and even that laugh was small. The vast majority of Who's Harry Crumb? didn't even make me smile. There's a lot of slapstick here but it's generally cheap slapstick and there are also some fairly poor quality lines such as the really corny cherry Coke one. In addition to being unfunny this movie is also usually quite boring.Planes Trains  Automobiles is an excellent comedy and definitely the best film I've ever seen John Candy in. Uncle Buck is another John Hughes film starring Candy and I found that one to be pretty good when I saw it for the first time last year. Who's Harry Crumb? came out the same year as Uncle Buck but sadly it's significantly weaker. Although Candy basically plays the same kind of character here as he does in the two Hughes comedies I've mentioned and the late comedian's talent was a big help in both of those he couldn't save this film. Even if you have found Candy hilarious in certain other works which I would say I have you could still easily be disappointed by this particular comedy which he starred in. Many viewers may disagree with my comments on this crime comedy but I still think it's a mediocre effort and don't think I will ever really care who Harry Crumb is.".

The whole film is basically a fun example of the bumbling detective genre that include the likes of The Pink Panther 1963 2006 Inspector Gadget  more recently the Austin Powers films that all feature some inept bumbling detectivecopspy who comes up against some bad guy's  through luck chance or a minor miracle manages to solve the case  save the day. While not hysterically funny there are laughs to be had here  the whole film is played in such a way that you just end up liking it Candy is just great as Harry Crumb who gets some very funny moments of physical comedy as well as some baffling silly  amusing oneliners. The supporting character's are fun too from the villain to the kidnapped daughter to her sister who ends up helping  assisting Crumb to a nympho wife who just wants to be rich to a female cop who hates private detective's. The plot is simple the identity of the kidnappers are given away early on so it's all played for laughs from then on as the cool collected villains face up to the bumbling idiotic Crumb is some nice scenes. At just under 100 minutes it didn't feel that long there's a steady stream of gags funny disguises  disasters of Crumb's own making to make the time pass harmlessly enough.The whole film has a very 80's vibe going on from the fashions to the music to the cars  decor. It looks nice enough but there's not much going on apart from a scene in which Crumb drives a car without brakes  a climax set at an airport where Crumb chases a plane while riding a truck. There's no real violence although there is one use of the 'F' word that was cut from all UK version until the 2008 DVD. While not deep or serious I don't really think it was ever meant to be  as a simple light hearted comedy about a bumbling detective I thought it was good  it made me laugh a few times  I did have a good feeling while watching it so it must have done something right.Not a huge boxoffice success this was filmed mainly in British Columbia in Canada. The acting is good from a very game cast of well known actor's with Candy himself as the standout Shawnee Smith before the Saw films is cute  likable as his sidekick while Jeffrey Jones Annie Potts  Tim Thomerson give decent comic performances.Who's Harry Crumb? is not a masterpiece by any means but as a straight forward crime comedy full of gags oneliners puns likable character's  performances silly outfits  one or two action scenes then I thought it was pretty good  better than average if not a classic. It's a comedy  I laughed at it that just about says it all really.".

This movie just isn't funny at all. Although it wasn't meant to be taken seriously it is after all a comedy the laughs are few and far between and most definitely NOT original. Unfortunately this was made on the downhill slope that Candy's career became after 'Planes Trains  Automobiles'. It was simply NOT funny and a major disappointment considering Candy's performance in movies like 'Stripes'.Someone who wants a good John Candy movie should try 'Only the Lonely' or 'Stripes'. Avoid this piece of crap at all costs.".

The film has a certain appeal about it that makes you feel sorry for Crumb and wish that he solves the case but lets you laugh all the way to the end.One of the better John Candy films and I would go as far as saying that is is better in terms of laughs than Planes Trains and Automobiles but if anything see this film for the part when John Candy is on top of the fan I had tears in my eyes through laughter.".

It's the equivalent of Ingmar Bergman's Virgin Spring just as Chinatown might compare to Cries and Whispers.Huston's daughter Angelica contrary to some reviews above fits extremely well is not harshlooking and unattractive and is a superb casting. The difference between her looks as a teenager and as a woman are striking but to call the casting nepotism is political correctness gone mad. Huston shouldn't ever be expected to conform to the codes of 21st century Mother Grundies. Assaf Dayan may paradoxically have been helped by struggling a little in a language that was not his native tongue in conveying the sheer youth and hothouse growth of the character he's portraying. Contrast his performance as the psychotherapist in Betipul the Israeli TV series unceremoniously and unsubtly copied by HBO's In Treatment. Age changes men as well as women and in similar ways even if Hollywood critics disagree.Huston's movie is based on a curious but superb short novel by a very underrated writer. Hans Konigsberger reminds me in some ways of Milan Kundera. He has the same flat intellectualised style contrasting starkly with the passion of the issues he's addressing. The novel takes about an hour to read and is well worth the effort.Does someone know where I could buy a copy of the movie?".

	schema:headline " A very personal picaresque historical story with parallels to the 60s FlowerPower movement for those that want them.";
	schema:reviewBody "I thought the title A Walk With Love And Death might be a metaphor  that the walk might stand for a journey or a quest or perhaps even someone's lifetime with various romances and fatalities along the way. In fact the title is an absolutely literal description of what the film is about  the story follows a disillusioned student in the Middle Ages as he walks to the sea encountering love and death en route. It is a very picaresque story similar to the books that Tobias Smollett was writing in the 18th century though in this case it is based on a novel by 20th century Dutch novelist Hans Koninsberger. John Huston is the unlikely director behind it and he brings a modern sensibility to the proceedings  his film is more concerned with FlowerPower Peace  Love and the 60s Youth Movement than the barbarism of the Middle Ages.During the Hundred Years War student Heron of Fois Assi Dayan marches out of a lecture in Paris and decides to walk across his wartorn country to the sea. It is a long trek and even though it takes him through beautiful landscapes there are constant reminders of the scars of war. Dead bodies drift by in rivers cattle lies slaughtered in the fields and castles burn on the horizon. During the trip Heron meets a beautiful young noblewoman Claudia Anjelica Huston who eventually joins him on his journey to the sea. Neither of them has ever set eyes on the sea before but both share a foolish dream that if they can somehow get there all their problems will be resolved. However the land becomes increasingly dangerous as peasant armies rise up in revolt against the soldiery and the young companions gradually realise that their quest is doomed to fail.Huston's film is very personal too much so to be a commercial success at the time. Having said that some of the remarkably negative reviews that have been written about it are hardly fair. It is true that the story is very minor and insubstantial it is true that the two leads are awfully wooden in their roles it is true too that Dayan's character is completely unbelievable in a Middle Ages setting with his saintly makepeacenotwar attitude. Yet in spite of these flaws there are still things to enjoy in A Walk With Love And Death. It is a beautifully shot film with eyecatching colours and backgrounds captured in luscious DeLuxe by Ted Scaife of The Dirty Dozen and Khartoum. Georges Delerue provides a haunting score and Huston generates some fairly realistic scenes of hysteria and combat one sequence in which a man is quartered is notably gruesome albeit in a nongratuitous way. While the film is not in the very top tier of the director's work it certainly doesn't deserve to have been neglected as much as it has. It is perhaps best summed up as a worthy flop.".

Huston is fairly interesting and manages to convey both her noble blood and the idiosyncratic attitude that would have led her on this journey.

	schema:reviewBody "Walk with Life and Death A 1969  out of 4When people discuss the great or awful films in the career of John Huston this effort here rarely gets mentioned and that's probably because even the most diehard Huston fan either hasn't sat through it or simply can't make it through. Apparently Huston selected to do this as something small and personal and one does have to respect him for trying a poetic movie like this but in the end the thing just didn't work for me. A man Assaf Dayan hears the calls of the sea and decides to leave Paris and walk to it. Along the way he encounters various forms of violence and a blooming relationship with a young woman Anjelica Huston who soon joins him on his journey. This film wasn't popular when it was first released and it seems very few people have bothered checking it out since then even though we've got a legendary director and his famous daughter in her first role. From the reviews I've read there appear to be a few fans of the film and it's poetic vision but for me the thing was a pretty big misfire. One of the biggest problems is Anjelica who is simply way out of her range in this type of part. This would have been a challenging role for anyone let alone someone making their first acting appearance. At times she seems all over the place while at other times she seems as if she doesn't know where to turn. Dayan doesn't fair much better but at least he seems at ease going through everything on this journey. The film moves at a rather slow pace which I didn't really mind as Huston was trying to build some atmosphere out of it. The dialogue cinematography and even the music score are all used to be dreamlike but it just never really came together for me. This isn't an awful movie or an embarrassing one but it just felt too empty for me.".

She's very awkward here and the role is awkwardly written and the whole thing simply doesn't work.I have read some things Angelica herself wrote about this film  that her father was often not active in her life and that he wanted to do this film to sort of make things up to her i.e. allow her to star in something he was doing. Also that it was made to some degree to piggyback on the popularity of Zeffirelli's '68 Romeo and Juliet which created a brief interest in romance films in medieval settings. That makes perfect sense but the film A Walk with Love and Death doesn't work on any of those levels unfortunately.A rather sad waste of some amazing talent. Knowing what Angelica has become you have to wonder what she could have done actingwise under different circumstances. Also it's particularly unkind to cast a young woman of her looks  interesting but harsh and definitely not pretty  in this sort of role where her lack of prettiness seems at odds with the character. You can't help but feel sorry for her here! You can file this one under every dad thinks his daughter is beautiful right next to Sophie Coppola's debut in Godfather 3. And nothing against either amazingly talented lady but this further proves that nepotism not only is a bad idea but IT DOESN'T WORK.".

	schema:reviewBody "Given the tenor of some of the other reviews posted here I should start by making the extent of my disagreements clear.First this film is unquestionably Jane Campion's best work to date and it represents in particular a significant advance beyond her previous work in The Piano.Second this film while unapologetically feminist in point of view in no sense attempts to shoehorn James's artistic vision into an ideological box for which it is unsuited. On the contrary James has probably never been more sensitively interpreted on screen.Third purely as a film The Portrait of a Lady belongs on a short shelf among the very best movies of the 1990's of whatever genre.Consider what Campion was up against A literary adaptation in the first place itself almost a recipe for cinematic failure a Henry James novel in particular a novelist who situated most of the action in his novels in the invisible social and psychological spaces between his characters and whose works therefore constitute a kind of standing temptation to focus on picturesqueprestigious historical ambiance at the expense of narrative power and a story as James himself pointed out centered on the seemingly quite confined topic of one very ordinary young woman's working out of her particular destiny.Out of these distinctly unpromising materials Ms. Campion created a film in which nearly every scene adds depth and color to her story even after repeated viewings. And her Isabelle Archer beautifully realized by Nicole Kidman in possibly her finest performance to date is as fully tested and tried by life's moral and epistemological ambiguities and as fully responsive to life's promise on film as Henry James's heroine is on the printed page. One could hardly ask for more.".

On the contrary James has probably never been more sensitively interpreted on screen.Third purely as a film The Portrait of a Lady belongs on a short shelf among the very best movies of the 1990's of whatever genre.Consider what Campion was up against A literary adaptation in the first place itself almost a recipe for cinematic failure a Henry James novel in particular a novelist who situated most of the action in his novels in the invisible social and psychological spaces between his characters and whose works therefore constitute a kind of standing temptation to focus on picturesqueprestigious historical ambiance at the expense of narrative power and a story as James himself pointed out centered on the seemingly quite confined topic of one very ordinary young woman's working out of her particular destiny.Out of these distinctly unpromising materials Ms. Campion created a film in which nearly every scene adds depth and color to her story even after repeated viewings. And her Isabelle Archer beautifully realized by Nicole Kidman in possibly her finest performance to date is as fully tested and tried by life's moral and epistemological ambiguities and as fully responsive to life's promise on film as Henry James's heroine is on the printed page. One could hardly ask for more.";

I also dislike his overattentiveness to detail and I must confess a prejudice against any writer who says in 10 pages what they could just have easily said in 2.  Yet THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY once you get into it turns out to be quite a powerful novel and given how much I loved THE PIANO I was really looking forward to what Jane Campion could bring to it.  Rarely have I seen a movie version though which is so far off the mark but still has worthy parts to it.Let's start with the mistakes.  Campion claimed she was reimagining the story of Isabel Archer an American woman of character but not of means who eventually marries unhappily instead of just giving a straight filmed version.  That's all well and good but what she and writer Laura Jones do is all but gut the motivations behind the story we don't see Archer's vitality early on so we have nowhere to go when she falls and we don't see what draws people to her.  And when Madame Merle and Osmond appear they are so obviously snakes in the grass that we think Archer is a fool for trusting them instead of feeling empathy for her.  It doesn't help that Malkovich is so obviously bored here he does nothing to exude any charm.  Hershey comes off better but what's done with her character is a little strange as well.Nevertheless this movie can't be easily dismissed.  First of all Campion's gift for imagery still comes through she visually expresses the passions lying hidden in the novel which few directors do when adapting period pieces.  Also Kidman grows more confident as the movie wears on so we do get a sense of Isabel.  But as someone already commented the most worthy element here is Martin Donovan as Ralph Isabel's sickly cousin in love with her and whose advice sets the whole story in motion.  He doesn't play for sentiment but earns it instead.  The ending also keeps its power.  Still this is quite a missed opportunity for Campion.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just three years after The Piano' itself a well thought out and carefully prepared film Jane Campion comes up with an adaptation of a Henry James novel that deserves just about the highest possible accolade. The Portrait of a Lady' not only showed exquisite care in preparing the scenes of fragments of late 19th Century England and Italy and an accurate eye for the costumes as well as some first class performances from the actors but also a refined adaptation of this splendid novel.Henry James North American but lived most of his fruitful life in Great Britain was himself an elegant literary figure whose writing easily overcame the frequently insipid hypocrasy of many Victorian era writers. He was able to hold an elegant storyline whilst obeying the formulas of the times whereas many other novelists of the times could not or changed literary formulas  for example Dickens and of course later Joseph Conrad who was not British anyway. However his novels would seem to defy easy adaptation to celluloid Jane Campion and Laura Jones have pulled off one of the greatest feats ever in the cinematographic world. Very few literary delights are lost as the dialogues are scintillating witty or just simply elegant. Added to that our old friend Sir John Gielgud plays his small part with that extreme tenderness which only old age and experience can lend John Malkovich in this film shows that in many others he has been miscast under Jane Campion's orders he offers here a tremendous reading and understanding of the characteriology of Gilbert Osmond which James himself would have enjoyed seeing. Simply superb. Which I imagine is exactly what Jane Campion sought. Barbara Hershey was evidently inspired by this perhaps somewhat feminist interpretation of the novel though by no means can we say that this was not what James intended she was magnificent in her secondary rle and well deserved her Oscar though if you push me I suppose this film should have won all of the Oscars on offer in 1996.but it is not important anyway. Andhm Nicole Kidman? Forsooth young man  this creature can actually act Ms Kidman is not limited to simply being the lovely young lady accompanying the leading actor whoever he may be as she has so often been doing in other films she also needed Jane Campion's inspiration to produce what surely must be her best performance to date.Wojciech Kilar's music is superb beautifully synchronised with the film offering rich orchestral tones and the pieces of Schubert on the piano were well chosen in line with everything else in this film. There were certain other fragments of music which I was not able to identify and may have been by Kilar himself. The music offered that final touch that elevated some moments to the heights of a poetic rhapsody. Stuart Drybergh's photography joined these sonorous accompaniments soaring to supreme and wondrous revelations visual aspects reaching state of the art perfection. Never have I seen so clearly in a film to give but one example the real difference in light on a sunny day in England and a sunny day in Italy..The New Zealand directress sic sorry Jane Campion has carried out a masterpiece comparable with Fanny och Alexander' that great film by the unique Ingmar Bergman. She accomplished with admirable precision and style exactly what Martin Scorsese failed miserably at with his The Age of Innocence' 1993qv. I am expecting great things from Ms Campion she is not yet 50 and in the world of art 50 years of age is but the threshold to maturity. But with The Portrait of a Lady' she has already reached such heights of perfection that it is seemingly impossible to go much further. Or can she?".

And how can the same director that has made the two most boring movies I have ever seen Two Friends and this one also be the same person behind Sweetie and Holy Smoke  the two finest examples of a movie drawing real characters in real places I have ever seen? This film left me in a state of semiparalysis.Being a fan of slowpaced foreign and period piece movies I was pretty surprised at how much this movie bored me.  I'm writing this review to try to sort out my feelings of bewilderment.I think one problem is the use of John Malkovich.  We've seen him soar to great heights in the paradoxical Being John Malkovich and The Glass Menagerie but here his monotone is overly droll and predictable almost as if he is playing off himself in a Saturday Night Live sketch.  In fact the most enjoyable part of this movie was the scene where Mr. Malkovich twirls the umbrella in an ambiguously literal attempt to hypnotize Isabel.  If only there were more of these elements in the film....Then there's Nicole Kidman whose underachieving attempts at acting has managed to ruin films by not one but two of the greats Ms. Campion and Stanley Kubrick.  Her delivery was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's in Mr. Ripley  obviously lost.  She's just another pretty face thrown into a role of substance after receiving excessive amounts of hype.  Watching them act gives me the same feeling I get watching the members of Milli Vanilli try to sing.  In their element they can be undeniably sexy or cute but in deeper roles the viewer is left completely clueless to their characters' motives.  Is Isabel supposed to be docile alluring witty incontrol charismatic or notincontrol?  We can't tell.In this mess Barbara Hershey and Martin Donovan as the sickly cousin were both very good.  But alongside the weak link Kidman there was little they could do.  And Campion made some extremely unusual stylistic sidetracks the very sidetracks that work in the Holy Smoke India scenes.  But in a period piece the fading dream suitors inexplicable intro and Chaplin filters seemed inappropriate  although one has to admire her for trying.  Even when I don't agree with her methods I respect her sense of adventure but let's face it I'll love her forever because of Sweetie.  With a little more humility from Campion a different Isabel and a more invigorated Malkovich this film might have worked.For a good treatment of James try to scare up a copy of the 1961 film The Innocents.".

Is Isabel supposed to be docile alluring witty incontrol charismatic or notincontrol?  We can't tell.In this mess Barbara Hershey and Martin Donovan as the sickly cousin were both very good.  But alongside the weak link Kidman there was little they could do.  And Campion made some extremely unusual stylistic sidetracks the very sidetracks that work in the Holy Smoke India scenes.  But in a period piece the fading dream suitors inexplicable intro and Chaplin filters seemed inappropriate  although one has to admire her for trying.  Even when I don't agree with her methods I respect her sense of adventure but let's face it I'll love her forever because of Sweetie.  With a little more humility from Campion a different Isabel and a more invigorated Malkovich this film might have worked.For a good treatment of James try to scare up a copy of the 1961 film The Innocents.";

	schema:reviewBody "This review mainly focuses on the comparisons with The Piano.A lot of people might say The Piano is a better movie. It is certainly a prettier movie with lush imagery and music and especially the latter was somewhat lacking in this movie in favor of a lot of dialogue.Portrait of a Lady is still far superior to The Piano in terms of story acting and psychological depth. Where The Piano wasn't much more of an excuse to put some very pretty images and music on film this movie actually has very real characters that don't just serve as eyecandy. The same goes for the scenery. Although some scenes definitely look lush most of the movie looks quite dark with little light and a blueish color overall. Quite fitting the mood because it is a tale of an unhappy woman who despite her financial independence and plenty of male admirers fails in finding freedom and happiness by making the wrong choices in life.John Malkovich is excellent as always as a dominant insensitive and cruel husband holding his daughter from another marriage perfectly on his leash and attempting to do the same with Anne Archer who he marries. A far cry from the man we were supposed to hate in The Piano but who I actually found sympathetic and felt sorry for that was a difficult and unthankful role by Sam Neill I think Campion was to blame. Mr. Osmond Malkovich was convincingly real and malicious also because the character was reasonably well written and is pretty much the cause of everyone's misery thus being the center of the story. Still perhaps a little too onedimensional but this seems to be a bit of a recurring Jane Campion flaw we put a male character in a movie and we have to make him look evil while the women are mostly kindhearted tho I did find the Holly Hunter character in The Piano quite unsympathetic. It seems to me that Campion has a much greater understanding of the female psyche than that of the male.Judging Portrait of a Lady overall I have to conclude that it has excellent acting and a good tragic storyline that is involving enough. The camerawork and scenery serve their purpose depicting a dark somber environment in harmony with Anne's feelings and to think that most of the film takes place in sunny Italy!. Some people may be however bored by the amount of dialogue and the lack of pace and music. Others may find the main character too cold but I think she's not. Anne Archer is her own woman a character well acted by Kidman and has a good heart. She just seems to have trouble giving in to deeper desires instead giving in to a destiny she believes to be hers and thus suffering from a dominant husband. A popular theme among findesiecle naturalist novels the Inevitable Fate and it is so ever tragically present here.I think there should be a lot more costume dramas like this one. The only movies like this one which I also recommend is The Age Of Innocence and The Remains Of The Day. I prefer these movies and Portrait Of A Lady over Jane Austen adaptations because those depict too small a world with teaparties and marriages as the only things that matter in life. Findesiecle films are much better tragedies.I give this one 75 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " A Brilliant Novel A Mess of a Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady stands as one of the greatest psychodramas in literature a precise and coolheaded dissection of the evolution of a privileged idealistic if slightly arrogant young woman. This work exemplifies so many qualities which distinguish his view of human nature he is compassionate empathetic and observant yet unyielding in exposing the follies bad judgement and darkness inherent is his characters. No one especially Isabel Archer is let off the hook for their misguided choices and her fate is tragic yet completely plausible and as laid out by James completely compelling.A lost opportunity is the best way to describe the film.  It is interestingly photographed full of greys blues and whites and suggests an almost funereal solemnity in its production design and cinematography.  And Nicole Kidman makes a perfect iridescent Isabel Archer she looks the part in every respect and certainly conveys the character's intelligence and poignant receptivity to the sights and people around her.Would that the film had served her better Jane Campion and the scriptwriter Laura Jones eviscerate James's novel but retaining the basic story and structure but put it through the meatgrinder of 90s feminist revisionism.  It has been transmogrified into a simplistic tract of victimization and domestic violence but in doing so Campion and Jones haven't managed to at least raise the story's entertainment value or even create a coherent narrative line for the audience to follow.  Rather than present Isabel as a poignant charismatic figure who unwittingly corrupts her life through bad choices and misguided idealism the writer and director show us a woman who is victimized by a big bad Man who keeps her locked up in the house abuses her and steals her money upon duping her into an unhappy marriage.   In doing so James's great work has been drained of its universality and dramatic impact. And while sexual exploitation and gender roles certainly play a part in sealing Isabel's fate in 19th century society by ignoring the trenchant thematic notions of self determination and the risks of emotional idealism presented by James in his book we are given a shallow onedimensional creation lacking in James's acid edge. Campion cheats a modern audience of discovering filmically a great and stillrelevant work by a writer who dared to travel down the darker alleys of a more civilized age.".

This work exemplifies so many qualities which distinguish his view of human nature he is compassionate empathetic and observant yet unyielding in exposing the follies bad judgement and darkness inherent is his characters.

A much better way of telling this story since James' prose is so rich with internal motivations and feelings which cannot easily be revealed by dialogue or even by facial expressions would be to have voiceover.

She has only had one failure and that was In the Cut which instead was really bad.Saying this it goes without saying that i am astonished over the low rating on this movie here at IMDb it just tells you in the end that you can never be sure on what other people feel.The Portrait of Lady based on the brilliant 19C novel by Henry James tells the story of a young orphaned woman Isabelle Archer who is taken under the wing by an aunt and later an uncle and a cousin and brought to Europe. Being a woman fond of her own ways and her personal freedom Isabelle guards her future very well she declines a couple of favorable marriages in favour of her own independence. As she inherits money and becomes self sufficient she travels through Europe and soon comes to realize that independence is quite a hard position to guard and far more difficult to manage that in real life than just having the young persons idea of it. Her travels becomes a journey of maturity and struggle with herself.What James novel so brilliantly exhibits is the mechanics of a mind of a young person even a person of any age and James does this so balanced.Campions film in turn takes on the essentials from the novel drags it through a bit of Freud and end up with a version that transcends the barriers of time up to our days. What Campion succeeds with is to modernize the novel make it more accessible to a modern audience and in the end to portray what another costume piece did Orlando transcendence.She does so with a brilliant cast amaze yourself over the actors involved above!! with Nicole Kidman in the lead as Isabelle. Others to mention a few is Martin Donovan as her cousin Ralph Richard E Grant as Lord Warbuton like cut from the from the novel!! Brilliant!! John Malkoviich as Osmond Barbara Hershey as Madame Merle and John Gielgod also brilliant here so downplayed. All actors are brilliant mentioned or not.Although I really like Marin Donovan who I think is a much neglected actor it would have been interesting to see Malkovich as the consumptive cousin Ralph the part was originally offered to him but got lost somewhere....Campion also have the magnificent help of cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh who makes it possible to to render the movie its pictorial qualities and in the end its total art impression instead of just a costume drama.Personally I like the Piano but it is reportedly to be only a prior sketch to this one.My recommendation is SEE IT no matter what judgment has been passed on it on these pages.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen this. I just say It has certainly been my pleasure getting to see this amazing movie. Jane Campion really did her best to bring us Isabel Archer's portrait. I'm not ashamed to say that The portrait of a lady by Henry James is the best movie I have ever seen. I know what I say. I have seen a bunch of movies and I can really say that it's much better than those. It's beautiful visually wonderful costuming perfectly acted.The plot of the portrait of a lady is excellent and different from other drama movies. It's extremely interesting and highly recommended by me. The story is about a woman who rejects a most lucrative marriage proposal in favor of her hunger to experience the world. She wants to be free and marry the person she wants to. Isabel's defiant refusal stuns her suitors Lord Warburton Richard Grant and Caspar Goodwood Viggo Mortesen as well as the relatives who she is staying with in England. Nevertheless her admiring cousin Ralph Touchett Martin Donovan secretly urges on her dying father to leave Isabel a great deal of his fortune. Isabel is very happy being rich but this large inheritance makes her be deceived by her duplicitous friend Madame Serena Merle perfectly played by Barbara Hershey who leads her into an unfortunate marriage to an evil devious dilettante Gilbert Osmond John Malcovich. Gilbert Osmond has a beautiful child named Pansy played by the Italian actress Valentina Cervi. She is very obedient and apparently submissive. She is in love with Edward Rosier Christian Bale However Gilbert doesn't like him that much because he is not as rich as lord Warburton. He wants her to marry lord Warburton even though he was Isabel's suitor. He just wants to become rich no matter how unscrupulous he has to be in order to ensure his success. Isabel's only comfort is Pansy. Isabel loves her but she doesn't know many things about her parentage. It was a surprise for me to find out about Pansy's mother. It made it so interesting. Isabel suffers gravely for having married Osmond. But after the dark truth  behind Madame Merle and Osmond's deceits are revealed. Isabel awakens to an incredible freedom. In emerging from the darkness of her folly. Isabel discovers her one true love her cousin Ralph Touchett in an epiphany that sends her forth in hopeful triumph stronger and more selfless than she had ever imagined. At the ending It's beautifully filmed as she runs to be free in the snowy winter in England. Have a look at the landscapes and the snowy England. They are gorgeous. They made one of the best and different endings ever made.  It's truly one of the best sceneries I've ever seen in my whole life. This movie takes us to the grand European background Rome England FlorenceItaly of splendid wealth and OldWorld sensibilities. It must have won an academy award for best cinematography. Nicole Kidman was stunning to star as Isabel Archer. She really envelops herself into the role very well. I never ever thought she could act like this. She was perfect to play Isabel Archer. This is definitely her best performance. I thought she was going to get an academy award for best actress in a leading role in this movie but she didn't. Anyway she must be an Oscar winner in 2002 for best actress either in Moulin Rouge or in the Others. I have seen those movies and I think they were pretty good However they weren't as stupendous as this one Nicole Kidman showed us her great acting skills.Barbara Hershey is altogether outstanding. She gives an absolutely exemplary performance. She got an academy award nomination for best actress in a supporting role in this movie which was very welldeserved. She is amazing. She really made the movie as great as I thought it was going to be. She really knows how to act. What an excellent actress!! It must have been difficult to star as the complicated enigmatic Madame Serena Merle Nevertheless she really got it. I'll not forget when Madame Serena Merle regretted to have been so mean to Isabel. It's also unforgettable as she is outside the convent and it's raining hard she gets totally damp as she's telling Isabel the truth about everything.The musical score by Wojciech Kilar is extraordinary. It is completely delightful  as Madame Serena Merle plays the piano. It's also remarkable as Isabel fantasizes sleeping with her three lovers the music reaches an incredible mysterious level. Also listen to the fabulous music at the beginning and the ending. It's wonderful just listen to it.I don't really like romantic movies at all. This is why I liked it so much. It wasn't romantic. The scene as Gilbert Osmond twirls Isabel's umbrella to hypnotize her was interesting and outstanding as well as dark and terrifying. It was utterly dramatic. I haven't seen more beautiful woman than Isabel Archer Nicole Kidman in this movie. It's worth watching just for intellectual people who like drama movies. If you like drama and epoch movies. Watch it! You'll not regret it. Otherwise Don't even try watching this because you'll easily get very bored and it's highly unlikely you'll like it.  Overall TWO THUMBS UP!! This is the best movie of the century. It has truly been the most brilliant adaptation ever made. Congratulations Laura Jones. After saying this I just can tell that the sad part is that it was very underrated. Anyway What can I do?. 1010".

This fabulous film from director Jane Campion is one of few that have made me weep with tears of mingled joy and sadness. Nicole Kidman gives an oscarworthy performance playing the independent strongminded Isabel Archer who becomes trapped in a stifling marriage with admirers around her at every corner to remind her of her bad decision while her personality slowly wilts and fades.  John Malcovitch plays her cruel and controlling husband and is absolutely fascinating to watch as he subtly bends Isabel to his will. Viggo Mortensen in one of his best performances is in his element as the kind and loving admirerer of Isabel Caspar Goodwood. Isabel's future lies in her own hands if she has the courage to take a chance. Portrait of a Lady is a fascinating and riveting film full of deep emotions that will move and touch you.  A wonderful film that is sublime in all ways possible.".

John Malcovitch plays her cruel and controlling husband and is absolutely fascinating to watch as he subtly bends Isabel to his will. Viggo Mortensen in one of his best performances is in his element as the kind and loving admirerer of Isabel Caspar Goodwood. Isabel's future lies in her own hands if she has the courage to take a chance. Portrait of a Lady is a fascinating and riveting film full of deep emotions that will move and touch you.  A wonderful film that is sublime in all ways possible.";

Two emerging nations begin to clash after Paris the Trojan prince convinces Helen Queen of Sparta to leave her husband Menelaus and sail with him back to Troy. After Menelaus finds out that his wife was taken by the Trojans he asks his brother Agamemnon to help him get her back. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity for power. So they set off with 1000 ships holding 50000 Greeks to Troy. With the help of Achilles the Greeks are able to fight the never before defeated Trojans. But they come to a stop by Hector Prince of Troy. The whole movie shows their battle struggles and the foreshadowing of fate in this remake by Wolfgang Petersen of Homer's The Iliad.";

	schema:reviewBody "Loosely based on Homer's 'Iliad' Wolfgang Petersen directs this epic war film with an ensemble cast including Brad Pitt Eric Bana Orlando Bloom Diane Kruger Sean Bean Brian Cox Rose Byrne Garrett Hedlund Peter O' Toole Brendan Gleeson  Tyler Mane. Set in 1193 B.C. this movie tells the story of a war between the two cities of Troy and Sparta and the story of one of the bravest warriors to roam ancient Greece named Achilles. Brad Pitt delivers one of the best performances of his career as Achilles giving the right amount of power and strength. Eric Bana is also terrific as Prince Hector trying to negotiate peace between Troy and Sparta. Besides the supporting cast Peter O' Toole is just perfect playing the king of Troy. The only disappointing character in this movie is Orlando Bloom as Hector's prince brother who seems to overreact in every scene he is in as if trying to end the project early and walk away with his paycheck. Although the movie contains a running time of 162 minutes director Wolfgang Petersen perfectly makes the audience forget about those 162 minutes because they'll be distracted by all the incredible action. This movie contains some of the most elaborate action sequences that I've ever seen on film. The costumes and the art direction all stay true to the ancient Greece setting and they all create a realistic feel to the movie. This movie is perfectly wellmade from the distinguished art to the intense battle sequences. Yes the movie is somewhat inaccurate to Homer's Iliad but at least this movie is flat out entertaining. I haven't seen that much gladiator movies in my time but I can safely say that Troy is one of the most remarkable and actionpacked motion pictures that audiences will never forget. Troy in my review actionpacked beautifully wellmade.".

Best I can describe Troy is that it's a bastardised version of the Iliad. It's puzzling why they even tried to squeeze the epic into a feature length film in the first place. Hopefully we'll see the Iliad made into a great series one day as all films and miniseries thus far have been major disappointments.However the film does have some redeeming features despite it's many floors. But for starters I do apologise I'm going to rant about the things I really hate about this film first just to vent my disappointment!!! I don't want to spoil the plot for you if you haven't yet seen the film so instead I'm going to mention some of the great things that never made it in from the Iliad.this section contains some plot clues and spoilers First off Menelaus! The character is completely different from Homer's original epic to the point which makes me want to cry... for those who have read the Iliad one of the greatest moments for me was when Menelaus fights like a lion standing guard other Patroclus' lifeless body. And other moments when he's shown to be honourable like during the duel with Paris and saying he would rather leave Helen than risk the lives of so many of the Argives.Also Telamonian Ajax his character butchered with poor casting and a premature death at the hands of hector. What about when he rescues Achilles' body from the Trojans!!! Another potentially great role hampered by poor scripting and bad casting was Nestor which should have been Anthony Hopkins and Diomedes and his 'Aristeia' that never made it. Not to mention Achilles never lived to see the wooden horse built let alone use it to infiltrate TroyIlium. Don't get me started on Orlando Bloom!!!Yet despite all this Troy has its moments and some good performances and cast choice. Pitt as Achilles was the good obvious choice as with Bana as Hector. The rest of the cast did the job... The Myrmidon beach landing was quite entertaining and their armour was stylist if a little too fantasy inspired for my tastes.I didn't really want to put people off as the film was reasonably entertaining. Just felt like I needed a rant being a bit of a purist having loved studying Homer's Epics and other Greek tragedies.".

And those thousand ships battles and numerous special effects certainly please the eye.  But huge battles do not a great film make.

The only actor who even comes close to his brilliance is Eric Bana who strikes a suitably tragic note as Hector.On the other hand Diane Kruger does not convince as Helen and I am forced to agree with Empire magazine  her face might launch a rubber dingy or two but not a thousand ships.Also James Horner's music score is rather pedestrian which is hardly surprisingly considering he had very little time to write it.  Apparently some brainless studio executive thought it was a good idea to replace Gabriel Yared's reportedly marvellous original score because it wasn't thumping enough'.  Why on earth anyone thought it a good idea to eliminate the supernatural elements of the tale I will never know.  Integral to The Illiad are the gods and their petty squabbling and Achilles whose identity as a son of the gods is never explained.  Those with no previous knowledge of Greek mythology will be wondering why on earth an arrow in the heel kills him.Overlong overblown and ultimately taking itself way too seriously the film is worth watching for a single brilliant scene where Peter O'Toole begs Brad Pitt for the body of his dead son.  In that moment the film ascends temporarily to the level of the great Greek tragedy.".

	schema:headline " Troy is a thrilling ride one of the year's best and most underrated action movies.";
	schema:reviewBody "Troy 2004 Dir. Wolfgang Petersen I like so many others was expecting A LOT out of Troy when I headed along to opening night and sat in the dark cinema watching the action unfold. Initially I didn't think as much of the movie as I now do. I gave it a 710 on first viewing but I knew I had to see it again it is just one of those films that demands multiple viewings.So I saw it again for History class since it's not historically accurate perhaps that wasn't the best idea. And I bought the DVD.And look what happened.I strongly suggest to anyone who was looking forward to Troy in cinemas to rent or buy the DVD and give it another chance in your home. It is truly a much richer perhaps even exciting experience as your expectations have been lowered and often this makes a moviewatching experience better.Anyone who is not tired of the twohugearmiesfaceoff battles we've been seeing in The Lord of the Rings films and now many other films following in that trilogy's footsteps will sure love the battles in Troy. Troy takes it's battle sequences very seriously and while they have an epic grandeur look about them at the heart of the battle  men are dying men are killing other men. It's not all about kicking ass in this film. The battle sequences are a little more graphic than you might expect and they are certainly brutal.Brad Pitt looking absolutely incredible here the months of training sure paid off shoulders the movie with much confidence and adds layers to his arrogant selfcentred Achilles. It's refreshing that Pitt though technically the central hero of the piece plays the character in a less likable way than you might expect. Achilles is unpredictable and dangerous he was born to end lives. As the greatest warrior in history he is most definitely convincing.Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom play more emotional heroes and while Bana manages to give Hector an awesome kickass edge strong nobility and adds many dimensions to his heroic part Bloom doesn't quite handle the job as well. I do not dismiss Bloom's part in the film to be the pussy as so many have put it but in emotional scenes Bloom simply falls flat. His lines I'll hunt deer and rabbit we can live off the land! are often laughable due to bad delivery. It is more likely Bloom was put in this part for his looks rather than his talent which is still in question by yours truly. I did like though that Bloom had a more realistic touch the scene in which he faces Menelaus and fails to defeat him running back to his brother is nervewracking and powerful not all men were great buttkicking heroes even back then so it's good to see that put into the film even if he does play the more pussy role.One of my main complaints about the film the first time around was the unnecessary relationship between Briseis and Achilles. With more viewings I have come to appreciate this subplot a lot more. As Achilles puts it she gave him peace in a time of violence and war. Achilles is a character so often covered in other men's blood constantly killing and fighting that Briseis allows for Pitt to show the more sensitive side is actually useful to the character's development. Their final scene together is very emotional and the actors have genuine chemistry.Wolfgang Petersen was criticised for being too much of a claustrophobic director to take on one of the biggest films ever made but he handles the epic large scale of the film nicely if perhaps maybe not using as many swooping stunning shots as he could. I certainly would've liked to have seen more of the set of Troy exposed. In the inevitable firefuelled finale it is showcased brilliantly but more of these kinds of sequences would've been useful for Petersen to shut his critics up. He does a good job with the film rooting the battles in genuine emotion and intelligence and giving it a distinctive memorable atmosphere and artistic look.Perhaps as a historical piece Troy isn't the film you're looking for. But for sheer entertainment value it is one of the best films of 2004. Again I urge anyone who was disappointed by the film to rentbuy it on DVD and give it another spin it's not a decision you'll regret I know I didn't.910".

	onyx:emotionText "Troy 2004 Dir. Wolfgang Petersen I like so many others was expecting A LOT out of Troy when I headed along to opening night and sat in the dark cinema watching the action unfold. Initially I didn't think as much of the movie as I now do. I gave it a 710 on first viewing but I knew I had to see it again it is just one of those films that demands multiple viewings.So I saw it again for History class since it's not historically accurate perhaps that wasn't the best idea. And I bought the DVD.And look what happened.I strongly suggest to anyone who was looking forward to Troy in cinemas to rent or buy the DVD and give it another chance in your home. It is truly a much richer perhaps even exciting experience as your expectations have been lowered and often this makes a moviewatching experience better.Anyone who is not tired of the twohugearmiesfaceoff battles we've been seeing in The Lord of the Rings films and now many other films following in that trilogy's footsteps will sure love the battles in Troy. Troy takes it's battle sequences very seriously and while they have an epic grandeur look about them at the heart of the battle  men are dying men are killing other men. It's not all about kicking ass in this film. The battle sequences are a little more graphic than you might expect and they are certainly brutal.Brad Pitt looking absolutely incredible here the months of training sure paid off shoulders the movie with much confidence and adds layers to his arrogant selfcentred Achilles. It's refreshing that Pitt though technically the central hero of the piece plays the character in a less likable way than you might expect. Achilles is unpredictable and dangerous he was born to end lives. As the greatest warrior in history he is most definitely convincing.Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom play more emotional heroes and while Bana manages to give Hector an awesome kickass edge strong nobility and adds many dimensions to his heroic part Bloom doesn't quite handle the job as well. I do not dismiss Bloom's part in the film to be the pussy as so many have put it but in emotional scenes Bloom simply falls flat.

	schema:reviewBody "I finally got to see this movie in the bargain theaters here in El Paso on Labor Day. I originally hadn't thought much about the movie but as time went on it had left the regular theaters here in town and I realized that I'd wished I'd gone to see it. I remember hearing several outside critics blasting the movie as horrible and wanted to judge for myself. I'm very glad I finally saw this movie.This movie is not the usual Clash of the TitansJason and the Argonauts type of movie where the gods are constantly shown and portrayed as more important and powerful than the lowly humans. In fact this movie completely ignores the socalled gods and instead places the focus where it belongs  on the warriors themselves. I have studied the Iliad as well as other stories surrounding the mythical Trojan War since my days as an elementary school geek obsessed with mythology and Dungeons  Dragons. Instead of being targeted toward that audience this film demystifies the Trojan War and treats it in a manner in which it could have actually happened. We see that the elders who continually refer to their socalled gods come across as fools. One of the most telling lines is when Hector Eric Bana refers to the fact that Apollo did not strike down Achilles Brad Pitt for desecrating the statue. It is very telling that Hector seems to doubt the gods he has been taught to worship.I have been a longtime critic of Brad Pitt as a secondtier talent who became famous only because of his looks but in this film he surprised me. He is the TRUE star of the film. Achilles is easily the most interesting and entertaining character. I applaud Brad Pitt's effort in making his character a tragic hero. Achilles acknowledges that he is NOT the son of a goddess and is not immortal or invulnerable. The movie basically shows us how a rumor can blossom into a legend unto itself. Achilles' legend BECOMES immortal. He even refers to this in my favorite scene when he is inspiring his men and starts the invasion heavily outnumbered and still triumphs. Later in the same scene he scoffs at the socalled gods the Greeks and Trojans worship by decapitating the statue. I found this scene symbolic of the movie itself. The gods are nothing to both the characters and audience.Instead of supernatural powers and impossible feats we're treated to realism. Even Achilles' death is more realistic than in the myth. In the myth Paris does kill Achilles with an arrow but because he has no battle skills his hand is actually guided by Apollo.If there was one thing I did not like in this film it was the transformation of Paris into some kind of hero. Paris was a coward in the original myth and I saw no reason to transform him into an overnight hero in the movie. I guess Orlando Bloom fans wouldn't be able to bear seeing him as the bad guy and were given the uninspired transformation of Paris into a better archer than Robin Hood.While this movie was nowhere near the epic masterpiece that the producers had hoped or that it was advertised as it did not deserve the bad publicity it received from critics. I applaud the makers of this film and look forward to buying it on DVD.".

	schema:headline " Good film for warhistory fans flawed but worth every penny";
	schema:reviewBody "Troy is an excellent movie. For any warhistory buff there is enough here to feed upon to overlook any flaws.First in response to all the Gladiator lovers who said on the boards that there is no one to cheer for in Troy I say they are idiots. Gladiator was about a single protagonist. Homer's Iliad was always a complicated ensemble story. The audience has to deal with a lot of main characters and THIS IS A GOOD THING. Its the Iliad not Batman.There was a complaint about the film not having a good side to relate to. This one irritates me. Real life seldom has the simplistic good guy vs. bad guy dichotomy. This in my mind makes Troy that much more believable. When events unfold I actually believed they could happen. Japanese cinema is so good at times precisely because we don't know who the good guy is. The question is simply irrelevant.The script was written with a mind to keep the important details of the original story intact but to make it as realistic as possible. The gods are there but only in spirit. They don't get directly involved in the action like the original. I think this is a good thing as well. Troy looks like historical recreation rather than a literal translation of the poem. In one scene I thought there was an unlikely event and researched only to find it actually is in the Iliad. When the writer was asking for too much he was in fact being true to the text. My bad.OK visually this film is amazing. Not just the army special effects but the sets and scenery are all beautiful. The costuming is first rate and feels very authentic. Remember we are going back 3200 years. Quite an accomplishment.The violence is likewise beautiful. Blood and guts galore but interestingly it is both on the battlefield AND in single combat. A fight fan will appreciate the attention to detail in the combatants' moves. I had never seen a shield wielded so realistically on film. Spear and sword are given very realistic treatments as well.Brad Pitt is a good actor. No question about that. Here he has a few moments where he seems out of place a pretty boy in a soldier's world. But the combat scenes with him are more than enough to make up for that. It has already been discussed how much bigger he is than in Fight Club. The womens will have plenty to look at. His character is complicated and this is also true to the Iliad. Brad Pitt does this internal conflict lots of justice. His actions in the film really seem appropriate. I never asked like I do in other films Why did he do that? But this is not Brad Pitt's film. It's Eric Bana's.Eric Bana was amazing. If Achilles was complex then Bana's Hector is even more so. I had only seen Bana in Black Hawk Down and The Hulk and while BHD was good there wasn't much for his character to do but be a soldier. The Hulk was so bad I wrote him off completely blaming his acting for not saving a horrible script. But here in Troy I have newfound respect. He is the main character in the film if you judge by acting power. Lots of emotional struggling going on here that Bana takes on like a pro. He will join this generation's acting elite if he finds more roles like this.The rest of the cast is good enough with a special note for Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox. Their lines are well delivered and their characters are believable.The writing is good as far as plot development goes but I would take a few points away for some of the modern vocabulary. Stop playing with me the pretty Helen tells Paris. Playing should have been joking in that scene since I associate playing with modern English and even worse with modern hip hop English. I shouldn't be getting that feeling in an ancient epic.A".

	schema:headline " Troy";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a review of the film Troy which was released in 2004. It is directed by Wolfgang Petterson and written by David Benioff and based on the Iliad by Homer. King Agamemnon Brian Cox is ruler of Mycenea but wishes to rule an empire so his army slowly conquers the rest of what is now Greece. The only threat to his empire is a neighbouring country called Troy. Agamemnon's brother Menelaus Brendan Gleeson is tired of war so he negotiate's peace with the Trojan princes Hector Eric Bana and Paris Orlando Bloom. Upon leaving Paris reveals to Hector that he has taken Menelaus's wife Helen Diane Kruger with him as he loves her. Menelaus goes to Agamemnom to start a war and Agamemnom manages to convince legendary warrior Achilles Brad Pitt to fight among the Greek army. Hector and Paris arrive in Troy and tell their father Priam Peter O'Toole of the upcoming war. Agamemnom arrives on the beaches of Troy with 1000 ships but after day 1 Achilles refuses to fight and instead cares to Trojan prisoner Briseis Rose Byrne. Over the next two battles Hector kills Menelaus Ajax who is the Greek's best warrior after Achilles and Achilles's cousin Patroclus and finally Achilles decides to don his armour and face Hector in a duel to the death. Achilles wins and kills Hector but makes a pact with Priam to allow the Trojans 12 days of peace. After 12 days Priam and his men ride out to find the Trojan horse and all the Greeks gone. Priam orders the horse to be brought into the city of Troy. That night Odysseus Sean Bean and his men escape form the horse and open the gates and allow Agamemnon and all of his thousands of men in. Achilles also escapes from the horse and goes to find Briseis. in the confusion Priam is killed by Agamemnon who is in turn killed by Briseis and as Achilles escapes for a new life with her Paris shoots him through the ankle and he dies. While all three of leads have both good points and flaws it is Peter O'Toole and Julie Christie in small supporting roles that as per usual put in the best performances. Brian Cox seems to ham it up to much but Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean do well enough with the bland characters they are given. The fight scenes are great although some of the close combat tactics used by Achilles are all but impossible. The more rough style used by Hector of Ajax feels more realistic but the duel between Hector and Achilles is the best scene of the film.".

	schema:headline " Mediocre Troy story spoilers throughout";
	schema:reviewBody "Troy is an incredibly mediocre film. It neither offends nor inspires. Instead it leaves you feeling like an opportunity's been wasted  the money is there but the will and the talent are sadly missing.Apart from the leaden script and nondescript direction the film's main deficiency is Orlando Bloom. The man has always been a hopeless actor but here he plumbs new depths turning in a performance that is based entirely on puppy eyes simpering looks and flat line delivery. The man is wholly incapable of emoting. Although to be fair he is lumbered with a near impossible part  the snivelling Paris. Even the most talented actor would have a hard time bringing such a wretched person to life. But seeing as Bloom is among the least talented actors in Hollywood it makes the character all the more unbearable.The most infuriating thing about Paris is the way he stumbles through the story causing nothing but trouble and yet he ends up killing the mighty Achilles and smelling of roses. Perhaps in more talented hands this would have been fine but here it makes you question why you watched the film. This pathetic loser condemns thousands of people to death including his brother and father so that a blonde strumpet can play with his winkie. Brilliant! It's hard to pick a single scene that had me baying for Paris' blood there are so many but his most cowardly act comes during his fight with Menelaus Brendan Gleeson. He's meant to fight to the death ignorantly thinking that this skirmish will prevent further bloodshed. But even with his honour and the lives of his countrymen at stake he runs away like a big baby and hides behind his brother. What a pathetic excuse for a human being. I share Menelaus' outrage when he exclaims to Helen that this is what she left him for.And the scenes between Paris and Helen are nauseating. The two actors have zero chemistry and both have the screen presence of a couple of fruit flies. Do we care about their allconsuming love? Of course not. It's played like a couple of kids who have just discovered that their genitals are there for more than secreting waste material.And speaking of Helen isn't she supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world? Instead we get your average foreign starlet with too much mascara and a larger than average schnoz. Sure any man in his right mind would tap it but start a war over her? Forget about it.In fact a lot of the guys in the film are just as pretty as Helen. Just take the numerous ass shots we get of Brad Pitt. Then you have Achilles' cousin. He's your typical blondehaired dreamboat. And is it any wonder that the only thing that truly enrages Achilles is the death of his beloved cousin a cousin who he frequently engages in some lighthearted sword fighting with? But even though the film fetishes the male form as well as a zillion shots of Pitt's toned butt we also get to see an oiled Orlando Bloom  he's completely hairless of course it's strictly a torso and arse film  no tits or willies.But while the film fails spectacularly in terms of romance character development and interpersonal relationships it succeeds when it comes to action. The fight between Hector and Achilles in particular is superb. With lots of close contact and athleticism it thankfully resists the urge to become overly fanciful. Instead you get something that feels pure and believable.Another excellent fight scene is the one between Hector and Ajax. Again things are kept simple and the sequence benefits from it. I also enjoyed the fight between Paris and Menelaus  the camera in the helmet is an excellent way of generating fear and claustrophobia  but unfortunately its somewhat spoiled by Paris' cowardly actions. As is the final sequence where Achilles is slain. Here you have a character you're finally starting to like and he's cut down by a skinny imbecile with a bad curly haircut.That reminds me what's up with the haircuts in this film? All the men seem to have these weird semimullets  Sean Bean Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom especially. And then you have Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson who seem to have acquired Gary Oldman's bizarre tithead hairstyle from Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula. It's actually rather distracting  I spent a lot of time looking at people's heads the haircuts here are worse than the ones you see on a football pitch.But as bad as his haircut is I did enjoy Brian Cox in this film. Sure he's hammier than a ham sandwich but at least he seems to be having some fun with it. I also think that Eric Bana is pretty damn good  the film suffers badly when his character dies Hector is the heart and soul of the movie. However I think Pitt's performance is less successful. He's great in the action scenes but everywhere else he seems out of place.However I like the idea of Achilles being a celebrity a man who wants to further his own image at the expense of everything else. But as it is this element of the story like all the other ideas isn't developed enough. The film aims low and scores small.".

	onyx:emotionText "Troy is an incredibly mediocre film. It neither offends nor inspires. Instead it leaves you feeling like an opportunity's been wasted  the money is there but the will and the talent are sadly missing.Apart from the leaden script and nondescript direction the film's main deficiency is Orlando Bloom. The man has always been a hopeless actor but here he plumbs new depths turning in a performance that is based entirely on puppy eyes simpering looks and flat line delivery. The man is wholly incapable of emoting. Although to be fair he is lumbered with a near impossible part  the snivelling Paris. Even the most talented actor would have a hard time bringing such a wretched person to life. But seeing as Bloom is among the least talented actors in Hollywood it makes the character all the more unbearable.The most infuriating thing about Paris is the way he stumbles through the story causing nothing but trouble and yet he ends up killing the mighty Achilles and smelling of roses. Perhaps in more talented hands this would have been fine but here it makes you question why you watched the film.

I am talking about Menelaus killed cowardly by Hector or Agamemnon killed by Briseis or Achilles being the cousin of Patroclus or Hector killing one of the Ayaces and where is the other Ajax Diodemes and all the other Heroes??? If it would not have been for these alterations to the original story which really disturbed be if you ever read the Iliad you'll understand meand which i really regard as unnecessary and the usual Hollywood crap added to most American films a good dose of machismo exaggeration historical inaccuracy etc This could have been a great film but unfortunately it is not...But this movie is also far away from being a terrible film. The director and the actors did a nice job Brad Pitt acts very good as usual The guy that plays Hector does it in an amazing way too taking most of the sympathy of the public. The movie is exciting and the battles are good my favorite scene is before Achilles fights Hector and he repeats the same line that in Homer's book There are no pacts between men and lions!! Another thing that I quiet liked and that was different that the book is that in the film the GODS don't have much to do with the story while in the Iliad they are central... but that's not too bad I didn't miss Zeus or Apollo in the film and I think this is a smart move for the film because including the Gods would have been quiet difficult for a film like this.What i missed was the respect for some important aspects of the story which i mentioned before and which were removed unscrupulously ... It could have been and immortal epic but those omissions and alterations are unforgivable and bring my given note from 1010 to 710".

The fact that I am a Greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement I hope not to your annoyance.I spent 2 years of my life all we Greeks did actually analysing Omirus epos and not Homers as you see everywhere rhyme by rhyme. If I recall well it was Iliada Iliad on 8th grade and Odysseia Odyssey on 9th grade. Warner's Troy was a big disappointment to me and my fellow Greeks around the campus I study in the UK.Iliad epos is one of the very best literature works ever made. It was composed by a Greek poet Omirus a whole 400 years after the actual war. Historians put Trojan war around 1200 BC and the actual reason of the war not being Helen's beauty but the strategically crucial position of Troy. That said one may now understand that Omirus epos is not presenting the actual events as it's not accurate historically but this was never the purpose of this work. Reading this huge poem one can find himself wondering for the very definitions of honour love anger hate heroism discipline loyalty and so on. The best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle. None of these though were revealed in 'Troy'Warner's Troy was really cheap to my eyes and to other intellectual people English Finnish and German colleagues of me as well. It is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster computers graphics did the whole work and yet it is Wolfgang Petersen's best work. I conclude saying that you'd better watch something else instead. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. It is a really expensive B movie.Cheers Alex".

It amazes me that the director of this movie directed Das Boot. So I supposed some hard examples are in order so here's a few 1 The Iliad has nothing whatsoever to do with the Trojan Horse 2Achilleus probably one of the most complex characters in all literature is not a hybrid between Conan The Barbarian a Zen Buddhist and the father on Married wChildren 3The Atriadae Meneleus and Agamemnon had an entirely different fate than that in the movie and without those fates the entire sense of the story has vanished 4With the possible exception of O'Toole's Priam all the characters essences were stood on their heads and 5The Themes of the epic was utterly lost.

The screenwriter and director and ultimately the producers took The Iliad and tossed it into the movie blender that is Big Money. Then they pressed the liquify button. It amazes me that the director of this movie directed Das Boot. So I supposed some hard examples are in order so here's a few 1 The Iliad has nothing whatsoever to do with the Trojan Horse 2Achilleus probably one of the most complex characters in all literature is not a hybrid between Conan The Barbarian a Zen Buddhist and the father on Married wChildren 3The Atriadae Meneleus and Agamemnon had an entirely different fate than that in the movie and without those fates the entire sense of the story has vanished 4With the possible exception of O'Toole's Priam all the characters essences were stood on their heads and 5The Themes of the epic was utterly lost. This movie was awful. Just awful.";

CALI COLOMBIA and ORLANDO FLMore than just a movie TROY is a species of cinematic time machine. In a most compelling and exciting way it will transport you to a time and place far away to the Greek islands of over three millennium ago to be precise! For those of you with a good Home Theater this film will provide two hours of historical battles conducted in a very realistic and impressive way spectacular vistas of both land and sea seamless digital effects that are difficult to distinguish from reality and for women a well oiled Brad Pitt projecting a multifaceted and enigmatic Achilles whose performance was highly underrated by critics.In contrast Orlando Bloom Lord of the Rings  Pirates of the Caribbean as Paris was somewhat indecipherable leaving one with the question of whether the lack of character in his portrayal of Paris was intentional or due to an underpar performance . The rest of the cast appears to be generally well chosen with the exception of Diane Kruger in the role of Elena who looked like a mechanical porcelain figurine and bestows a resonance and a dimension to this historical drama rarely seen in a movie of this genre.As announced in the end credits TROY was inspired by Homer's Iliad authored some 2500 years ago. It's hard to understand the logic of purists who have cried foul! because Troy's plot often differs notably from Homer's original work. They complain that the movie is neither faithful to the Iliad nor to history. Well the fact that the thousands of gods and demigods present in the book are absent from the movie is perhaps not necessarily a bad thing!.As for historical events themselves nobody really knows for sure what happened in Troy three thousand two hundred years ago! Practically everything is purely conjecture! So consider that TROY is a completely separate film version  with a different name  of the written work the Iliad.It is worth making a few comments on some technical aspects of the production  costume design  sets  scenery  weapons boats and other elements of war demonstrate a work done taking his time with enough love and an almost obsessive attention to an endless number of details  almost impossible to see and perceive well the first time you've seen the movie but that clearly stand out during a second viewing.There have been many works where the Seventh Art has spent a fortune and the result ends up being anything but artistic! In the case of Troy at least it seems that the budget of 200 million has presented us with a very harmonious and aesthetic result . Even the sound for those who are set on these things is some of the best that has been produced so far for DVD! We must recognize the director Wolfgang Peterson  Das Boot Air Force One  The Perfect Storm which reached orchestrate an intense clear and consistent cinematic vision of Troy .A final recommendation....Despite the fact that Troy really lacks any scenes of graphic violence much less any sexually charged ones because of the amoral indecisive and unfocused tone of some of its protagonists it would probably be a good idea to do a prescreening with family and friends over 12 and then decide if you deem it suitable for younger people in your family!.Hoping you really enjoy your two and a half hours in the city of Troy in the second millennium before Christ ... and do not forget to pump up the volume ! 8....ENJOY!

	schema:reviewBody "My disclaimer for this is that I am a graduate student of Literature but I like a good action movie as much as anyone else. I was totally excited about this movie great cast great director a timeless epic story all the right components right? WRONG! Certain tales are timeless and should not be changed too much. I was all right with the screenwriters taking out the role of the gods in this story I was moderately all right with them cutting out the women in this tale overplaying Helen who never speaks in the Illiad and cutting out HecubaPriam's wife and Queen of Troycompletely cutting out Cassandra and I eventually came to terms with the fact that the Trojan Horse was in this version the Trojan Horse was not in the Illiad it was written about in the Aenied which was written a few hundred years later by Virgil and NOT Homer and even that the Trojan war took place over the course of a few days instead of years but there are LOTS of things that suck about this movie.Who was that girl who Achilles ran into the burning city to get? Who is she based on? For a second I thought she would be Cassandra mixed with some other people but then no. And I am completely SHOCKED AND AMAZED that the director took such artistic license as to kill Agamemnon in Troy. That is such a desecration of literature that I cannot believe that he thought he would get away with it. Does Petersen think that he is above yielding to the true nature of the story? That was it for me I turned it off then I don't care how the movie ends now.For all of these reasons I hate this movie what could have been a brilliant combination of action mixed with art Petersen missed completely because he changed the story SO much this is a sad and lame excuse for both an action movie and a cinematic version of Homer's tales. Petersen missed both marks by a LOT. I don't know who I'm more upset with the screenwriter who produced this crap or the director for making it viable. All of these things have been written and recorded and translated into every language for over a thousand years certainly the screenwriter could have picked up some Cliff notes for a reference.For those who are interested Agamemnon did not die in Troy. He went home with Cassandra as his concubine and was killed by his wife Clytemenstra becausebefore sailing for Troy he sacrificed his daughter to appease the god of the wind for good sailing. After his murder Clytemnestra cuts him up and serves him in a stew to her children Orestes and Electra. Wouldn't that have been a better end for a great villain?".

	schema:reviewBody "For a movie loosely based on a poem written thousands of years ago the director and screenwriter have done an excellent job in recreating the epic story and the ancient world on the screen which was probably quite a difficult task. The production is fantastic visual effects are great and yet my opinion on Troy is divided in two The movie is built in such a way that we the viewers aren't entirely sure who are the bad guys. Brad Pitt's Achilles is displayed as the star the hero and yet he fights for the Greeks who are displayed as brutal warriors under the rule of a greedy tyrant Agamemnon. In fact the entire Trojan War was started only because of the greed of the king of Sparta Menelaus. Paris the prince of Troy son of Priam the king took Helen Menelaus' wife back to Troy with him after a peace meeting in Sparta. This enraged Menelaus and so Agamemnon his brother rounded up the entire Greek army to attack Troy and retrieve his wife. On the other hand the Trojans are sort of shown as the good guys. Just because of one mistake that Paris made the Trojans now have to hold back an attack of 50000 Greeks while loosing thousands of husbands sons and cousins in the process. Hector is displayed as a family man He doesn't want to go to war he'd rather stay home with his wife and newborn child but he is loyal to Troy and must fight for her. This is slightly different than the way the Trojan War had always been conveyed to me Helen did not run off with Paris but Paris seduced her and practically kidnapped her with him back to Troy. Hector was a big brutal warrior who had absolutely no problem with killing as many people as he possibly could. I really liked the way the movie showed the Trojans as the good guys and the Greeks as the evil greedy tyrants. It's definitely a fresh and original approach to the story.Productionwise the movie is stunning. The costumes the sets and the weapons everything is topnotch with excellent attention to details. The visuals are also stunning. The shot of Brad Pitt standing on the deck of a ship with the camera slowly zooming out eventually revealing the entire Greek navy consisting of 1000 ships is really a treat to the eye. The computer graphics are excellent. It's really hard to tell in the huge battle scenes which soldiers are computer graphics and which are extras although you know that some of them must be CG because there are so many. The long shots of the city of Troy are also great eye candy. In all the one thing this movie is especially excellent at is entertaining and it is definitely a visually satisfying movie.The acting is also pretty good. Brian Cox definitely stands out as the powerhungry Agamemnon. His acting is topnotch. Peter O'Toole is also good as Priam the king of Troy. Eric Bana was great as Hector although I don't think he physically matches the part. Brad Pitt wasn't as bad as I was worried he would be. In fact his acting was quite good. Which brings me to my second opinion While Brad Pitt's acting was quite good I just don't think he fits the character of Achilles. It seems as if Brad Pitt wasn't entirely comfortable with Achilles' character so he took it and dressed it over his own personality which changed the character a bit. Physically though he looks perfect for the part. Eric Bana on the other hand is just the opposite. He truly captured the essence of the Hector character and his acting is great but I don't think that he physically matches the part. He's just kind of small and scrawny while Hector is supposed to be taller and more muscular than Achilles which is not how it seemed in the movie. It also seemed that his character was a bit too weak. He's supposed to be the greatest fighter on Earth matched only by Achilles and yet he struggled a bit just to kill Achilles' cousin who had never even been in a battle before. When you look at how easily Achilles killed the giant soldier in the very beginning of the movie it kind of makes Hector look far weaker than he's supposed to be. Also while Agamemnon was supposed to be powerhungry and greedy he was not hasty and was considered to be one of the wisest kings. And yet in the movie he makes very hasty and stupid decisions which kind of lower his character to a stupid powerhungry oaf while he was really quite smart. One character that I'm really happy about is Odysseus played by Sean Bean. His character's essence was truly and perfectly captured He's cunning a good warrior and extremely smart. He constantly gives Achilles advice on how to approach Agamemnon and is conveyed perfectly as Achilles' close friend. Odysseus also suggests various war strategies to Agamemnon who is reluctant to listen. Now as much as I dislike Orlando Bloom he actually pulls off the Paris character quite well and fits the part of the weak cowardly naive prettyboy prince perfectly.All in all Troy is definitely an entertaining movie and the production is remarkable but a few major historical inaccuracies strange casting choices and a particularly clich Hollywood ending lower my appreciation for the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot Bewildered young man stumbles into a tense game of chance when he impetuously steals a dead man's invitation.I really liked the original French movie though I found it to be a little pretentious. The American remake excises all of the art house elements in favor of big name actors a curiously extended back story for Mickey Rourke's character and some really bizarre but awesome acting from Michael Shannon. The original French version was also a bit more bleak and nihilist which I think was watered down for American version. Despite this I've seen several people complain that this movie was too bleak and nihilist! Wow. I guess some people were expecting a traditional bythenumbers thriller with car chases and shootouts rather than a pensive darker drama. Unfortunately a lot of the tension was also streamlined out this version though I might be misjudging because I already knew the plot. Still the brutality and nihilism of the original made all the starker by the black and white stock really stuck with me and I didn't feel as though I had quite the same experience when watching the remake.I'm not one of those snobs who thinks that the original movie is always better than the remake but in this case I think it's true. If I hadn't seen the original and liked it so much I'd probably rate this a bit higher. Judged on its own merits I think this is an enjoyable movie but it doesn't live up to the original. For a movie billed as a thriller it's lacking the tension that audiences expect and as a Jason Statham movie it's lacking in Jason Statham scenes which audiences will also expect. Despite my criticism and lukewarm rating I still liked 13 and I'd probably recommend it to people who haven't seen the original. However I'd highly recommend you see the original instead. It's a better movie.".

The American remake excises all of the art house elements in favor of big name actors a curiously extended back story for Mickey Rourke's character and some really bizarre but awesome acting from Michael Shannon. The original French version was also a bit more bleak and nihilist which I think was watered down for American version. Despite this I've seen several people complain that this movie was too bleak and nihilist! Wow. I guess some people were expecting a traditional bythenumbers thriller with car chases and shootouts rather than a pensive darker drama. Unfortunately a lot of the tension was also streamlined out this version though I might be misjudging because I already knew the plot. Still the brutality and nihilism of the original made all the starker by the black and white stock really stuck with me and I didn't feel as though I had quite the same experience when watching the remake.I'm not one of those snobs who thinks that the original movie is always better than the remake but in this case I think it's true. If I hadn't seen the original and liked it so much I'd probably rate this a bit higher. Judged on its own merits I think this is an enjoyable movie but it doesn't live up to the original. For a movie billed as a thriller it's lacking the tension that audiences expect and as a Jason Statham movie it's lacking in Jason Statham scenes which audiences will also expect. Despite my criticism and lukewarm rating I still liked 13 and I'd probably recommend it to people who haven't seen the original. However I'd highly recommend you see the original instead. It's a better movie.";

The winner gets a little more then a million the loser...dies. Never having seen the original I wasn't sure what to expect and honestly I watched this because of Statham. The beginning was a little slow but when the game started it really picked up and was interesting and very disturbing at the same time. Comparing this to Death Race I think is acceptable as it involves people doing their best to survive in a grotesque game. While Death Race was about cars and you had more of a separation from the killing this one is in your face. Spin the chamber cock the hammer point at someone's head while someone does the same to you then shoot. Either you live for next round or you don't. This is a pretty good movie with a good cast not counting 50 Cent and is a neat idea. I just think it was missing something. I think it was making you feel for the characters. You just don't seem to care who lives or dies and that hurts the movie. Overall an entertaining movie that is worth watching if for no other reason then morbid curiosity. I give it a B.Would I watch again?  I don't think so.Also try  Death Race 1  2".

We could barely hear the beginning of the movie all we really knew was that we were being bored to death. Considering we just watched Knight and Day a couple days prior we were really hoping to see a movie that was entertaining...or at least had a half naked girl in it. But watching movies these days is a little bit like playing Russian Roulette sometimes you pick a movie that feels like a bullet to the head. I guess thats where this movie shines because Russian Roulette is actually the plot and from what i gather it makes for a pretty lucrative betting franchise. If you left Requiem for a Dream feeling like you just saw the most uplifting feel good story of your life then you will love this movie. If your NOT a sick bastard like most of us then you will probably feel like crap the entire movie. The writer having watched the Deer Hunter WAAAYYY too many time thought it would be a good idea to just make a whole movie about guys standing in a circle shooting each other in the head. Each round of betting goes by and another bullet is added until Spoiler alert in case you didn't read the title of this god awful movie 13 becomes the victor and shortly afterwords is killed by an obvious person in predictable fashion. Its not all a fun and games so if your not a sports fan Don't worry. When the characters aren't shooting each other in the head they are laying in the fetal position in the break room crying until the next round starts. If thats not enough of a break between the action packed spin the cylinder wait till the light comes on fire sequences the cameras also go to the bookies taking bets from tux wearing high rollers. Lots of Big names grace the screen in a movie that must have taken almost 2 hours to film and 3 minutes to write on a napkin at Denny's after a night of binge drinking. You care nothing of any of the characters and during the first round of betting you hope every contestants gun goes off.

The entire premise of the film is ruined with poor 'foreshadowing' less than a minute in and worse acting throughout. The scenes and characters are predominantly bizarro reflections of a movie that was done perfectly well in the first place and ends up destroying any hope that this remake could add anything of value within the first 30 minutes.".

The cast list might have been promising but seeing their performance they could have easily been replaced by a group of amateurs.

The Hollywood cast was wasted on silly parts which needed no acting skills at all.The film tries to give some intensity and suspense but it lasts for about 10 seconds. I think the film could of been about 90 minuites shorter.I found myself extremely disappointed and therefore give it 1 star.If you love rubbish films then watch this because it is just that.I think it is fair to say that this film was just about on par with open water it really is that bad and is one of the worst films i have ever ever ever watched.

	schema:headline " A Remake By Same Director? Surely This Isn't A Game Of Chance";
	schema:reviewBody "Sadly another foreign classic has been taken on by Hollywood and ripped  apart. It's a shame as the cast is quite impressive Mickey Rourke Ray  Winstone Sam Riley Jason Statham David Zayas looking a bit more  menacing here an awful 50 Cent and the incredible Michael Shannon  fast becoming one of my favourite actors. But with such an engaging  story a respectable cast and with the same director as the original  French film surely they're not taking any chances here? Spin. Aim. Not  necessarily survive.  13 Tzameti was a great film for all the right reasons. The story if  you don't know is about an underground game of Russian Roulette where  people bet a lot of money on the outcome. In a weird sequence of  events a young man gets involved without knowing what it is and ends  up having to play the game. The first film was a black and white  gritty disturbing film that was full of suspense and everything that  worked about it has sadly floundered in this remake.  There's a number of reasons why. Firstly there is a multiple narrative  about some of the other contestants this means that you lose the  personal attachment you have with Riley in the first place. It also  means that due to the famous cast you know who is going to survive and  who isn't. The Hollywood sheen where it looks pretty full of rich  colours and takes place in a rich mansion means it loses all it's  dirty hostile and cold surroundings that made the original film feel  so awkward to situate yourself in. The buildup to watching the bulb is  about 1 of the tension of the original you honestly didn't know what  was going to happen in the first one but in this instance you feel like  you do and the tension isn't there at all. Instead it feels like a  stupid game where you don't care about anyone.  The stories of the other contestants detract from the mood and feel  like a complete distraction. Rourke's storyline especially. His little  story alongside the painfully unbearable 50 Cent is completely  unjustified and a waste of time. Statham and Winstone's brotherly love  hasn't been thought out and feels superfluous to say the least. Sam  Riley does an okay job as the young innocent player but his lack of  conviction makes you feel like a voyeur rather than being involved. The  actual game itself and the gambling techniques were also completely  unclear and convoluted with the bulb once being the main source of  tension in the first film rather being set as a preoccupation. The  reason why they had a hanging bulb in the first room is that it was a  tiny concrete room so the only thing there was the bulb hanging down  casting judgement. Whereas here you can't imagine that blowing each  other's brains out around such rich tapestry is ideal for cleaning up.  The rest of the acting was awful and even Shannon as another crazy  character is so OTT that you can't help but feel it's comical. The  only saving grace about this film is the Russian Roulette itself but I  implore you not to watch this film and go out of your way to watch the  original instead otherwise it will ruin the experience for you  completely. You'd think since 2005 Babluani would have become a better  director sadly he hasn't and with The Legacy  L'hritage  being his  only film made between the original and this one perhaps he's just out  of practise. A film that should never have been remade and is an  example that Hollywood should sometimes just leave things alone instead  of ruining the experience for everyone.  Rating 310".

I found this film to be very tense at times whereas the original just sort of limped along. Even though I knew what was going to happen I was still enthralled and captivated. This was mainly due to the inclusion of some humanity to the piece. More characters are explored and defined. Even minor roles explode such as Skarsgard's caring driver. The only flat acting comes from 50 Cent. Luckily he's quite a minor role. Michael Shannon takes a simple role as an emcee and transforms it into a terrifying and interesting character. The man is cinematic dynamite and has an intensity that is now being recognized. Winstone and Rourke add some empathy to their hard men roles. For s a film I had already seen this was still exciting stuff and I enjoyed it on more levels than the original. Well done to the director for improving on his potential.".

	schema:headline " Another brilliant genre masterpiece from Takashi Miike";
	schema:reviewBody "Takashi Miike is arguably one of Japan's hardest working directors who has tackled several different genres generally with good results. It used to be he would do a dozen or so projects a year and more in his earlier days. This of course has diminished in place of bigger projects but the man still remains one of Japan's most well known and prolific directors. So it shouldn't surprise anyone that his undertaking of yet another new genre the samurai epic is something of a highly anticipated film. And yes it succeeds in being another brilliant masterpiece from the man.13 Assassins though full of characters is quite simple actually. A master Shogun samurai is charged with the killing of a cruel and masochistic Shogun lord before he can become more influential in the Japanese Shogunate. With this mission he gathers together 13 samurai to join him in what appears to be a mostly suicidal mission as they take on a small army of soldiers. For years I have argued that Miike is a master filmmaker that doesn't get nearly the kind of recognition he deserves as his experience and resume put him up with the likes of other classic filmmakers. This shows in Assassins as he brilliantly puts together this simple yet purposeful film that calls back to the era of epic samurai films of the likes of Akira Kurosawa. In fact the influence of Seven Samurai is quite apparent here even going so far as to model some similar characters. However do not be mistaken as this is very much a Miike film a combination of his abilities to craft a mainstream film and a cult hit. And the trademarks are certainly there with the sadistic young Shogun lord bearing the bizarre violent fetishes that have been displayed in Miike's more obscure works namely Ichi the Killer. As you might suspect the violence early on is shocking effective and often unexpected. This gives way later on to more stylish violence but none the less the film is incredibly violent worthy of a hard R rating by American standards. Miike fans should be very pleased as he both employs his skills as a filmmaker while at the same time adhering to the general guidelines of making a samurai film. Here he delves greatly into the genre showing what it means to be a samurai and questioning their purpose through multiple views. Our master samurai Shinzaemon sees samurai as being for the people while Hanbei his rival sees them as entirely in servitude to their master without question. Even the young lord Shinzaemon's target has a view thought it is certainly the most negative of any of them.If I have any complaints it's two. First the film does little exposition of the large cast and most of the assassins are simply there to be a fighting force. We learn very little about most of them and even the samurai we do learn about including Shinzaemon get little exposition besides what we already expect that he's a great samurai of justice. The second would be the clunking over the head about samurai ideals. Miike continues to push messages we've already acquired early in the film and it becomes slightly redundant by the end. However these are minor complaints that are mostly easily ignored as the film runs at a fast pace with a 45 minute battle that is one of the best samurai battles I've seen on film comparing to Azumi or Zatoichi's finale but arguably handled better and with a master's touch.It's hard to know if this is Miike's pinnacle. He certainly creates a modern samurai masterpiece of an epic here. One particularly powerful scene will remain with you for a long time and this is the power of Miike's film one that goes to places many are afraid to tread to leave a lasting impression. Violent entertaining and with good examination of the samurai and their duties fans of Miike's previous films and fans of the samurai epic will not be disappointed.".

Starting with the acting  from the main characters their roles words facial expressions movements  done with such sincerity. Honest real emotions. It gives you a glimpse into a world where honor is defined and mutated by the hearts of men. One Samurai honors and views his position as a guardian of the people able to see comprehend and act upon injustice. And the other Samurai? His heart is not towards the people but has as I've said mutated into an honor that seemingly cloaked in the traditional honor of serving and protecting his lord is really mutated into a selfserving blinded existence that could potentially be his downfall. Who knows? Who triumphs in this movie? Be prepared to be surprised on many levels! The swordplay is bar none in my opinion. The landscape genuine with fantastic cinematography. As many movies in this genre there are moments of 'overthetop' exclamatory remarks that often typify a ShogunSamurai flick this just keeps reminding you that an American producer with more eye for gore than plot is NOT at the helm of this ship. This movie has it all for me. It has a plot a story line that will have you remembering the 7 Samurai The Magnificent 7 and a little of the ATeam but done so in a remarkable fashion executed in a classical raw well orchestrated fashion. I will watch this again. I will undoubtedly see more to this movie then than now. And that will be a treat unto itself. If you are a fan of the SamuraiShogun genre of film. Watch this. pop the popcorn or whatever but don't drink too much because you will not want to get up even for a bathroom break on this one!".

The first hour is simply superb as we watch the recruiting and planning of the assassins. The second hour is a maelstrom of action with katanas flashing and impossible odds. I actually preferred the first half in the main but absolutely no complaints with the action either.All in all this is simply by far and away the best action film of 2011 so far but putting in a genre does not do it justice  for this reviewer it is the most complete cinematic experience since Winter's Bone and is that rare animal these days  a film that looks feels and produces the sensation of film rather than TV.Probably one of the better films Japanese or otherwise I have seen this decade without exaggeration  it actually attempts to embody Bushido and understand the meaning and purpose of the Shogunate and the Samurai  plus Katanas  oh yes  lots and lots of katanas.....".

	schema:headline " Mainstream FilmMaking at its Very Best";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Miike Takashi was once a cult film phenomenon in Japan with controversial films such as 'Audition' 'Dead or Alive' series and 'Koroshiya Ichi'. Recently however his works are getting more mainstreamfriendly with highbudgeted films such as Crows ZERO series 'Ryuu ga Gotoku' and 'Yatterman'. Sure there's still plenty of violence but nowhere near as shocking nor horrifying as his earlier films. Is he a sellout? Perhaps. But how can we blame him? You'll be approached by major studios once you attain certain level of fame and higher budget means it must appeal to more people in order to get the investment back. '13 Assassins' delivers exactly that despite being a Japanese period piece which traditionally appealed only to the older generation and film buffs. The movie was screened at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival under 'Masters' category Films made by the most influential directors living today and Miike Takashi lives up to expectations.'13 Assassins' is supposedly a remake of 1963 jidaigeki Japanese period piece of same title. Let me tell you this the movie is not a true jidaigeki. Miike Takashi has transformed it into a 126 minutes of pure fun and excitement.The story is about an assassination attempt of a tyrant lord by 13 'true' samurais who are believers in justice and uprising on behalf of the People in the year 1844. The original film was famous for its 30 minutes of continuous battle sequence and the remake's may be even longer. Long story short it's actionpacked and more people got slashed than in the 'Azumi' series in this movie.As a service to Miike's cult following the movie is far more violent than typical jidaigeki with plenty of gutexploding headrolling action and some grotesque scenes involving a woman with separated limbs who created a plot device that ultimately became one of the most dramatic scenes in the movie. Unlike other Japanese war epics the movie also has a modern sense of humor with plenty of comedic reliefs astonishingly beautiful cinematography in the forest and advanced battle tactics. What's surprising is that none of it felt unnatural and corny like every other modern jidaigeki films that attempted and failed miserably to modernize period pieces such as Tsukigami and Sakuran.The cast is truly star galore with some of the biggest names in Japanese acting and experienced supporting actors. About half of them are actors with extremely unique or modern faces that I would've never expected to see in a period piece but none of the characters seemed out of place even though their faces are still very much identifiable. The biggest surprise was the choice of boy band SMAP member Inagaki Gorou as the twisted villainous lord. Not only did he hold his own among far more talented fulltime actors he was vital in much of the humor that made this film a success. Truly talented directors are capable of drawing the most out of his cast and Miike had done just that.'13 Assassins' is a movie destined to become a blockbuster. Time just flies by when you're having fun and the audience at the TIFF screening were applauding in every cool and dramatic scenes and eventually turned into a standing ovation as the credits started rolling. Remakes are all about translating an outdated or foreign culture piece into a work that appeals to the modern or local audience. '13 Assassins' does both with universal language of comedy and violence which transformed a classic period piece into a thriller for the modern taste that anyone over the age of 12 or whatever age restrictions this film will get in your country can enjoy despite being a jidaigeki. I would recommend this movie to just about everyone. In fact you don't even need to be a Japanese movie buff to appreciate it. Mainstream filmmaking at its very best.".

The movie was screened at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival under 'Masters' category Films made by the most influential directors living today and Miike Takashi lives up to expectations.'13 Assassins' is supposedly a remake of 1963 jidaigeki Japanese period piece of same title. Let me tell you this the movie is not a true jidaigeki. Miike Takashi has transformed it into a 126 minutes of pure fun and excitement.The story is about an assassination attempt of a tyrant lord by 13 'true' samurais who are believers in justice and uprising on behalf of the People in the year 1844. The original film was famous for its 30 minutes of continuous battle sequence and the remake's may be even longer. Long story short it's actionpacked and more people got slashed than in the 'Azumi' series in this movie.As a service to Miike's cult following the movie is far more violent than typical jidaigeki with plenty of gutexploding headrolling action and some grotesque scenes involving a woman with separated limbs who created a plot device that ultimately became one of the most dramatic scenes in the movie. Unlike other Japanese war epics the movie also has a modern sense of humor with plenty of comedic reliefs astonishingly beautiful cinematography in the forest and advanced battle tactics. What's surprising is that none of it felt unnatural and corny like every other modern jidaigeki films that attempted and failed miserably to modernize period pieces such as Tsukigami and Sakuran.The cast is truly star galore with some of the biggest names in Japanese acting and experienced supporting actors. About half of them are actors with extremely unique or modern faces that I would've never expected to see in a period piece but none of the characters seemed out of place even though their faces are still very much identifiable. The biggest surprise was the choice of boy band SMAP member Inagaki Gorou as the twisted villainous lord. Not only did he hold his own among far more talented fulltime actors he was vital in much of the humor that made this film a success. Truly talented directors are capable of drawing the most out of his cast and Miike had done just that.'13 Assassins' is a movie destined to become a blockbuster. Time just flies by when you're having fun and the audience at the TIFF screening were applauding in every cool and dramatic scenes and eventually turned into a standing ovation as the credits started rolling. Remakes are all about translating an outdated or foreign culture piece into a work that appeals to the modern or local audience. '13 Assassins' does both with universal language of comedy and violence which transformed a classic period piece into a thriller for the modern taste that anyone over the age of 12 or whatever age restrictions this film will get in your country can enjoy despite being a jidaigeki. I would recommend this movie to just about everyone. In fact you don't even need to be a Japanese movie buff to appreciate it. Mainstream filmmaking at its very best.";

	schema:reviewBody "Thirteen. The time has come to lay down your lives for the greater cause. Are you ready?13 Assassins is all about the payoff. And the payoff comes in the form of 50 minutes of absolute carnage at the end of the movie. The story is about 13 warriors some of the last truly capable samurai at a time when the era of those legendary soldiers was coming to an end who band together to kill a despicable deranged and utterly evil lord who is stepbrother and future heir to the ruling shogun. Greatly outnumbered the men devise a plan to force Lord Naritsugu and his guards to a village that they've prepared as what can only be called as a deathtrap. If you liked the Crazy 88's fight from Kill Bill Volume 1 or the massive battle at the end of Azumi then the epic showdown at the end of 13 Assassins automatically makes this a must see. But what about the preceding half of the movie? Most of that time is spent introducing us to the 13 assassins Sir Hanbei  the noble but loyal to a fault man who is in charge of Lord Naritsugu's safety and making us hate and I mean REALLY hate the lord himself. This portion of the movie was necessary to setup finale but it was understandably not as exciting or captivating as the lengthy battle it precedes.Rest assured though the storytelling doesn't stop when the action begins. Some action scenes in movies can be so endless that they become monotonous and boring as a result but 13 Assassins neatly avoids that trap by including character development until the very end.This is a brutal visceral movie from the sadism of Lord Naritsugu to the bloodsoaked frenetic finale. If that sounds like something you'd be interested in I heartily recommend that you give it a shot.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a huge fan of Takashi Miike so I was very excited to be able to attend a sneak peek of his latest film. Miike's one of those directors who seems to be trying to make at least one film in every style and this latest is his foray into the classic samurai avenging injustices genre. Only we all know by now that Miike's style is anything but classic. He always manages to find a way to infuse his own unique warped imprint into everything he touches. Especially since he insists on making the most bizarre cameos possible in all the films he directs. They are always really fun to watch for.So this film is great. It starts off just as slowly as any of these old period pieces set in feudal era Japan but it quickly descends into pure mayhem and madness. Shinzaemon is a retired samurai but he is prompted back into action when he learns that the Shogun's adopted code for bastard son Lord Naritsugu has been terrorizing peasants. He's been killing and mutilating men women and children all throughout the land and all with the most cold hearted disinterested cruelty. So Shinzaemon decides to assemble a band of other idle samurai to hunt this despot down and assassinate him. Those would be the thirteen assassins that give this film its title. And they really are a very mismatched band of warriors. And these men are caricatureseach outrageous in his own way.The one thing I really love about Takashi Miike's style is that he's never afraid to just go for it. He's got no shame and absolutely no restraint. I think this is because he has a deeprooted sense of humor albeit a very dark one. It's an ability to identify and appreciate the absurdity in life. Miike's films have a reputation for being pretty violent and bloody and this one is certainly no exception. But they are also incredibly funny. The gore is certainly meant to shock but I don't think it's just for the sake of a cheap thrill. I think it's meant to throw us of balance. His work is horrifying where we expect delicacy and actually quite subtle where viewers typically expect to find vulgarity. Of course we can always count on Miike for some truly silly stunts too. The result is audiences that are quite delighted and amused even after witnessing all the horror and disfigurement and devastation. Those moments are upsetting and heartbreaking for sure. But Miike really understands how a film should flow and balances these difficult scenes with the right dose of irreverence. He's a true master and this film is a roaring success.".

The last act is a bloody pulsepounding battle which in spite of its length over thirty minutes maintains a great level of tension.While action is spectacular characterization is lacking. Kji Yakusho is excellent as Shimada but only three or four of his men  including his nephew and a clownish bandit who is a clear homage to Seven Samurai's Kikuchiyo  get any kind of development the rest are simply guys with swords.

It may disturb as much as it amazes but you will have to acknowledge some great filmmaking.The nfant terrible of Asian filmmaking world according to one review I read here he takes a complete sidestep with this take on the traditional samurai tale. A group of samurai are brought together to bring down a sadistic Lord who is expected in time to be elevated to higher levels of authority. As a foil to the group is another senior samurai figure who is hellbent on protecting the Lord in belief that it is their duty not to take politics in their own hands but to serve.Some very violent scenes the story is excellent and builds up to a long battle scene which sees our heavily outnumbered group battle to complete their mission. The fight scenes are incredibly well choreographed and paced excellently and very violent also as you would expect.It's not just the action that is the crux of the film but actually the story is well done and the acting is exceptional. One added member of the group admittedly not a samurai adds some comic relief which helps to ease the tension at times and is a nice touch.The settings are exceptional and the dialogue is excellent. It can be difficult to follow early on as you try to figure out the political world and the figures that are relevant in this world but you will capture the gist of what is to be taken from it all.I thoroughly enjoyed it and if you are into old Samurai tales then this is one for watch. Very engrossing and will likely be one for repeat viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "On my list of favorite directors there is always a place for Takashi  Miike. I was introduced to Miike with Audition in 1999 and I have  collected his titles like a hunter would deer heads. Go up and down my  DVD collection and you will find Ichi the Killer 3 Extremes Visitor  Q Gozu One Missed Call and Imprint. I don't know if any other working  director has as many titles represented on my 'owned' list.  Naturally when I saw that Miike was bringing his latest effort 13  Assassins to the Toronto International Film Festival I was sure to  secure a ticket for the screening.  13 Assassins is a bit of a departure for the hard working Miike Miike  has 82 director credits to his name on IMDb.com. His films have  generally been violent films set in modern times. And many of his films  have been banned or misunderstood Audition Ichi the Killer. The  synopsis for 13 Assassins  A group of assassins come together for a  suicide mission to kill an evil lord  doesn't read like a Takashi  Miike film but with the violence and torture evident in the film's  first reel I was quickly assured that 13 Assassins was imprinted with  classic Miike moments.  13 Assassins starts by addressing the villain of the film Lord  Naritsugu Matsudaira Gor Inagaki who is one nasty sonofabitch. We  watch as Naritsugu shoots arrows into an entire family who are bound  and lying on the ground. Even the youngest child isn't saved from the  flying arrows.  We also witness a peasant girl who has had her arms and legs cut off.  Even her tongue was removed by the sadistic Naritsugu after her family  was massacred. These atrocities propel Shinzaemon Shimada Kji  Yakusho to abandon his Samurai values and he begins to amass a group  of warriors that will attempt to ambush Naritsugu and his army of  approximately 70 men in a town named Ochlai. His warriors amount to  twelve but when they set out on their mission and inadvertently become  lost in the thick jungle a 13th assassin  a hunter who knows the  terrain  joins the band of samurai out to avenge past wrongs and to  ensure that Naritsugu doesn't reach the Akashi domain where he is  destined to become second in command to The Shogun.  The first third of the film deals with Shimada amassing the team and  learning of further Naritsugu acts of violence against the people of  Japan. But when they samurai set up their ambush in Ochlai the fun  really beings and the final chapters are nonstop action and samurai  fighting.  13 Assassins is not only the most accomplished and polished film of  Takashi Miike's career it is also the best film we have watched so far  at the Toronto International Film Festival. And judging by the  audience's reaction I was not along in this sediment. The action  sequences were relentless and maintained a momentum that The  Expendables could only wish for. Every one of the 13 assassins were  identifiable and had interesting attributes the warrior the loco the  one who uses spears.  The sound that accompanied the action was award worthy. The theatre  rocked with explosions and with the sounds of blades cutting flesh and  was only drowned out by the consistent audience applause in  appreciation.  Last year I picked The Good The Bad and The Weird to be my favorite  film of the year. This year 13 Assassins stands tall at the top of the  list with just a few months to go.".

We  watch as Naritsugu shoots arrows into an entire family who are bound  and lying on the ground. Even the youngest child isn't saved from the  flying arrows.  We also witness a peasant girl who has had her arms and legs cut off.  Even her tongue was removed by the sadistic Naritsugu after her family  was massacred. These atrocities propel Shinzaemon Shimada Kji  Yakusho to abandon his Samurai values and he begins to amass a group  of warriors that will attempt to ambush Naritsugu and his army of  approximately 70 men in a town named Ochlai. His warriors amount to  twelve but when they set out on their mission and inadvertently become  lost in the thick jungle a 13th assassin  a hunter who knows the  terrain  joins the band of samurai out to avenge past wrongs and to  ensure that Naritsugu doesn't reach the Akashi domain where he is  destined to become second in command to The Shogun.  The first third of the film deals with Shimada amassing the team and  learning of further Naritsugu acts of violence against the people of  Japan. But when they samurai set up their ambush in Ochlai the fun  really beings and the final chapters are nonstop action and samurai  fighting.  13 Assassins is not only the most accomplished and polished film of  Takashi Miike's career it is also the best film we have watched so far  at the Toronto International Film Festival. And judging by the  audience's reaction I was not along in this sediment. The action  sequences were relentless and maintained a momentum that The  Expendables could only wish for. Every one of the 13 assassins were  identifiable and had interesting attributes the warrior the loco the  one who uses spears.  The sound that accompanied the action was award worthy. The theatre  rocked with explosions and with the sounds of blades cutting flesh and  was only drowned out by the consistent audience applause in  appreciation.  Last year I picked The Good The Bad and The Weird to be my favorite  film of the year. This year 13 Assassins stands tall at the top of the  list with just a few months to go.";

Having seen this garbled junk I would proffer the guess that his real purpose was not to make a movie but to get material to write a howto book one that could be titled How to Make a Samurai Movie by and for Idiots. It's not just the U.S. that is dumbing down is it? Pity Japan.Threefourths of the way into the movie I mentally disassociated from it because the endlessly repetitive overkill became boring. Suddenly I could care less about the movie and began to wonder what it would be like going to a restaurant run by Takashi Miike. It would be perhaps somewhere in the foothills of western Tokyo. I would arrive at dusk and be welcomed into an old thatchedroof cottage converted into an elegant restaurant. The darkness of the interior would be softly illuminated in places by the warm glow of paper lanterns. Each dish would arrive one by one like scenes in a movie one after another. First a lacquered bowl of miso soup would arrive at my table wisps of wakame a few green slices of scallions and tiny cubes of tofu would be floating in it. Yum. Delicious. Then would be brought a side dish of thinly sliced lotus root green soybeans and hijiki. So far so good. Then about halfway through the repast industrial fluorescent lights would be clicked on overhead the purpose of which would be to destroy the deeply rich traditional atmosphere. Then with about as much finesse as his scenes in the movie of ultimately boring repetitive endless crowds of slashing that went on and on and on and on. And on and on. And on and on and on and on and on Miike would toss down a slab of cooked eel right on the bare wood of the table in front of me not even bothering to use a plate. He would uncap a jar of powdered Japanese sansho pepper and dump the whole jar all over the cooked eel. Looming over me and wielding the bloodied thigh bone of a wild boar he would force me to eat this concoction with my fingers. Me all along thinking like while watching the movie that good cooks know that a dish of food can be ruined by using too much strong spice. The movie was made unpalatable by that boring eyenumbing endless crowd slashing scene. Watching these scenes could be likened to trying to eat sushi that is more wasabi than rice or fish or that eel above that isn't just tastily seasoned with sansho pepper but thickly submerged in it.And that stupid ending. The guy doing a terrible impersonation of Toshiro Mifune's Kikuchiyo in Seven Samurai walks up to the only other survivor of the total massacre showing zero evidence of his having been stabbed through the throat and otherwise slashed by swords deeply. I was thinking perhaps they were both dead until I didn't care. The only meaning that scene had was Miike was messing with the audience. So it's like back at the restaurant I'm finished unsatisfied nauseous and with an enormous mental bellyache but ready to pay the bill. Miike says Ha ha. You know that eel you thought you were eating? It wasn't really eel. It was just textured vegetable protein. Ha ha. Fooled you didn't I? Betrayed to the very end. I mentioned idiots above. Whenever I see a movie this bad I look at the hundreds of people listed in the end credits and wonder how so many people can be involved in the making of a movie and not one of them with an ounce of intelligence. Today I got to thinking that movies are often not so much group efforts as mob efforts and after all a mob has the intelligence of the least intelligent member and the emotional stability of the most psychologicallyscrewedup person in the mob. Why was the evil Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira riding a horse when people in his position at that time would be carried in palanquins? Stupid. How did those 13 idiots carry tons of explosives by foot over those mountains they got stupefyingly lost in? They hardly had anything at all they were carrying. Stupid. What was that business with the jerk who had rows and rows of spare swords to swap with the ones he was using? To show him throwing them to amazing effect would be something to see and an excuse to have a ready supply of them but no he just drops the ones he's using leaving himself briefly unarmed just to pick up another sword. Stupid. That huge vat of darklooking blood spilling from the top of a building that had neither precursory scene nor effect. Stupid. Those 13 jerks who have their quarry trapped like vicious barracuda in a barrel. What do they do? Figuratively get naked and climb into the barrel. Stupid. They didn't have to kill 200 armed warriors they just had to kill one man. One man who was constantly in the open riding a horse. That they couldn't is just well stupid. Takashi Miike and his crew. Stupid. Me for wasting my money on this trash The most stupid. Downright imbecilic. Thanks for making me feel that way Miike not.But is it possible that the film makers became so befuddled that this movie beginning in a superrealistic way at some point in a totally confusing fashion reverted to being something merely symbolic and representational in a ludicrous way? Exactly. Ludicrous. Way beyond stupid.".

The black and white 1963 version is a stoic film that is beholden to Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai 1954. It revels in the detail of the plot to kill the cowardly and arrogant Lord Naritsugu. It also revels in strategy and tactics of the eventual battle.Miike Takashi's remake changes a few minor elements of the plot adding a terrifying and gratuitous moment of a victim of Lord Naritsugu's perverted amusements. This is the most successful and disturbing scene in the whole production.It is surprising how similar the first hour of Miike Takashi's remake is to the original but unlike the original this new version seems to rush as if desperate to get to the action. As a consequence some memorable scenes in the original such as the attempt of Lord Naritsugu to cross a bridge feel less dramatic and rushed.Miike Takashi has changed the character Lord Naritsugu as depicted in the 1963 version. Instead of an arrogant cowardly and childish character Naritsugu has become an angelic psychopath softly spoken and not at all a coward. This new version of Lord Naritsugu is less satisfying than the hysterical and broader characterisation in the original movie because now Naritsugu enjoys the battle to the point of orgiastic pleasure rather than being fearful for his pathetic life. Miike Takashi's remake throws out of the window any attempt to explain the battle in terms of strategy and tactics. Here the extravagant traps and automated barriers look as if they were designed to keep out hungry dinosaurs rather than improvised fences to trap an enemy and dictate the conflict. The original 13 Assassins 1963 succeeds completely in showing how the village is converted into a death trap and the desperation of those that can't escape. Miike Takashi instead turns the battle into a chaotic frenzy with ridiculous and utterly unconvincing computer generated flaming cattle charging down the main street. Another WTF moment is the explosion of blood that pours down the roofs after two Samurai are blown up.Miike Takashi can be a stunning film director and although 13 Assassins could be called his most mainstream adult work it fails in comparison with the 1963 version.".

There wasn't a lot of special effects to rely upon and as a subtitled movie the dialogue was concise and good at conveying the plot. I especially loved the speech given to the Samurais as they were training If you don't have a sword use a stick... if no stick use a rock... you'll die but make the enemy feel pain. It's not a precise quote but those are some very inspirational words.It was just a no frills film of David versus Goliath that had depth. 13 Assassins conveyed so much emotion with the little dialog and the imagery.

	schema:headline " Film of two halves but both work well in different ways";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a little wary of films from Takashi Miike as although they are generally received as good my experience of them has been that they are bloody and very odd. Thirteen Assassins though seemed a bit more accessible in terms of being more straightforward which in some ways then makes the violence a little easier to watch. The plot here sees the amoral behaviour of Lord Naritsugu infuriate a small group of men who led by veteran samurai Shinzaemon set out to trap him and his 100 entourage of guards led by samurai Hanbei in order to kill him and end his rise to power for the greater good.This plot essentially cuts the film in half. The first half of the film is the setup and is mostly dialogue driven. It is slow and patient but not dull as the main thing it does is to turn the main character and the audience against Naritsugu by virtue of the terrible things he has done. This is brutal and quite shocking in regards some of the things we see halfsee or view the aftermath of. At the same time it gives us some time to get to know the thirteen main characters although there is an air of honour to all of them the characters do have traits of humour weakness anger and so on which mark them out but also add some colour to the telling. The second half of the film begins when the trap is sprung and a small village becomes a contained killing field soon to be filled with bodies and blood.I had wondered how I would find this because there was always the potential that action involving this size of a crowd would just be a mess of flailing and blood and that it wouldn't have any tension or flow to it. To a certain extent this is a bit of a problem at times but mostly Miike overcomes it by splitting up the characters across the village and mixing smaller conflicts with bigger ones. You do still need to buy the sight of tired individual men cutting through a stream of 20 men but the narrative sort of makes this easy it is a time of peace with a lower standard of samurai but also it isn't all this type of action. It is bloody but without being overly gory for the sake of it. The delivery manages to make me believe the concept of the honourable death not something I do normally because of how dishonourable Naritsugu is and how likable Shinzaemon is throughout. The cast do well in this regard not only to make characters but also to remain distinguishable in the midst of the chaos and blood. Yakusho is strong in the lead and he contrasts well with Ichimura and Inagaki well both of whom are also good even if Inagaki has a bit of an open goal in regards doing a simple amoral character. The supporting cast are good and mix their characters well with my favourite being Iseya who is fun and funny even if what his character represents sort of doesn't work for my western viewpoint.Overall though Thirteen Assassins is an engaging film that has good buildup which explodes into chaos and violence for the second half. I don't think it is perfect but in fairness some of the problems I had with it came with the plot and the territory so they are not failings so much as just part of the film.".

	schema:headline " Great but with minor flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "13 Assassins is a bad ass movie. I would have loved to see this movie in cinema but unfortunately German audience cinema and distributors are ignorant so it was a direct to DVDrelease. Story is simple mid of 19th century. Evil lord who loves torturing people should be assassinated by a group of samurai. Similarity with Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece Seven Samurai is given but it is a remake of a 1960's movie with the same title. Unusual normal for a Takashi Miike movie he proves in my opinion that he is able to create movies for bigger audiences and not only film lovers with focus on Asian cinema. Although he has left the underground a long time a go. Like I mentioned above this movie would have deserved a theatrical release. I love chambara movies and have seen many. This is definite a return to the genre even if Miike makes some mistakes at points the movie is outstanding. Costume setting actors. Everything has been created with extreme love for the detail. A entire village was set up and then more or less completely destroyed for the movie. The main battle is epic. 40 min non stop action. Miike keeps the violence relatively low for his standards. Two or three decapitations not really any severed limbs. Could have had more I thought but then it probably wouldn't have worked for a bigger audience. The actors are superb and suit their roles. I did feel reminded of good old sixties with Mifune and Nakadai. The actors might not possess their status and their charisma but they are close and Miike is proving that he can handle serious and bigger stuff. The CGI he should have let done by an European or American team then there wouldn't have been any visual flaws. The blood from the roof....I really would like to know if Miike was inspired by Kitamura's Azumi in which there is a similar scene towards the end. For people who don't like dialogs and long introductions the movie is split in two. A very long build up over half of the movie and the last third the battle. I am reviewing the international version with its 2H 5min runtime. The Japanese is half an hour longer. I am looking forward once released....and for the next Miikemovies. A director the international critics can't ignore no longer.....".

This is definite a return to the genre even if Miike makes some mistakes at points the movie is outstanding. Costume setting actors. Everything has been created with extreme love for the detail. A entire village was set up and then more or less completely destroyed for the movie. The main battle is epic. 40 min non stop action. Miike keeps the violence relatively low for his standards. Two or three decapitations not really any severed limbs. Could have had more I thought but then it probably wouldn't have worked for a bigger audience. The actors are superb and suit their roles. I did feel reminded of good old sixties with Mifune and Nakadai. The actors might not possess their status and their charisma but they are close and Miike is proving that he can handle serious and bigger stuff. The CGI he should have let done by an European or American team then there wouldn't have been any visual flaws. The blood from the roof....I really would like to know if Miike was inspired by Kitamura's Azumi in which there is a similar scene towards the end. For people who don't like dialogs and long introductions the movie is split in two. A very long build up over half of the movie and the last third the battle. I am reviewing the international version with its 2H 5min runtime. The Japanese is half an hour longer. I am looking forward once released....and for the next Miikemovies. A director the international critics can't ignore no longer.....";

	schema:reviewBody "For so long I've waited to be blown away by a film. Every movie I've watched recently just doesn't measure up. As films continued to disappoint me I found solace in comics and TV. Finally Takashi Miike releases his masterpiece. This film is grand on every scale and is so beautifully composed it hit every note. I'll start with the expectations of a Miike film. He is known for his violence and gore which is simply underestimating the man. Sure films like Visitor Q and Ichi the Killer flirt with controversy before sodomizing it but he knows how to create a movie. He manages to reduce and compromise our expectations with the opening scene. A man commits harakiri. Always gruesome but Miike actually cuts to just the man's face. Is Miike getting soft? Far from it. This just means that the violent showdown is all the more powerful. He releases the violence when the time is right. Unlike recent Hollywood action films Sucker Punch and Battle LA the journey towards the action is what makes it so fascinating. Miike spends a long time exploring his characters and their beliefs as well as the themes of the movie. This means that the final fight is about something and someone. They aren't just trying to kill a guy they are showing us what they believe. Like many samurai films this deals a lot with loyalty duty and honor. However it is far more critical of these things than previous films. Inagaki plays such a despicable villain that it parodies how dedicated his samurai are. Inagaki is such a fun villain to hate. He's egotistical and grotesque always relying on those around him for protection. The film has a lot of dialogue as it escalates towards the finale but it never tells us the exact plan. I was completely unprepared for the last 40 minutes. Miike has built up his characters has outlined the threats and then increased them and everything is set to go. So why is the finale so epic? First of all it starts with the absurd. Despite it's build up Miike throws a curve ball but does so with such confidence that we are still gripped. He presents his 13 assassins at first as being almost invincible. They dive around take on dozens of samurai etc. but it's all a lot of fun. Next he starts to injure the protagonists. It comes as a shocking reminder that these guys can be hurt making us now fully invested in the scene. Miike shoots everything with a simple fluidity. You can see what is going on who is killing who even though you are surrounded by blood and explosions. Finally as the characters have been whittled down we get a personal confrontation. One that reminds us what all this is for. It takes a lot of skill to make a lengthy action scene enjoyable for its duration. Especially when it goes from fun to tense to tragic before it all comes to an end. It's a film that really does come together. I was more than satisfied and I felt that I had been escorted on a complete journey whilst enjoying the sites.".

	schema:headline " Just like an average Hollywood actionflick";
	schema:reviewBody "Even though this film reminds a lot of the superior Seven Samurai it is more like the average Hollywood action flick. At the beginning of the movie the 'badguy' is introduced. He seems to be so evil that he's hard to believe as a real character. Unrealistic villains like this are very common in bad action films and we all know that 9 out of 10 times a bad guy like this gets killed or punished at the end. This brings me to the biggest flaw of this film the predictability.There are no surprises in this film there is no suspense. You'll watch it the same expression on your face from beginning to end because everything is predictable. After 20 minutes into the film you already know what will happen. There will be a big fight not all the samurai are going to survive and at the end the bad guy will get killed and they lived happily ever after. But then you have to wait about an hour before this takes place. This is quite a boring hour because all they're doing is sitting in a circle discussing how they are going to attack which is not interesting to listen too trust me. Meanwhile the villain is traveling from A to B. They talk some more in a circle villain travels. They talk villain travels.Then finally it's time for the grand finale.....but..it's just plain boring. Plain sword fights nothing special some of them die like you predicted and it's time for the final showdown with the bad guy. The clichd hurt villain crawling on the ground begging words like 'it hurts! i don't want to die! i'm scared!' is nothing original. This has been done way too often and most of the time in B action flicks. There's nothing new in this film that we haven't seen before already. Sure the cinematography is OK the acting is decent but that's about it. It's better to go watch Seven Samurai instead which I'm not even a big fan of but it's definitely better than this knock off.".

The film tries to be realistic but is over the top quite a few time. The characters are just like in 7 samurai One of them is not a real samurai you have the pro the young the gambler etc.... It's just a remake of 7 samurai. The final battle in the village and the trap is also comparable. This movie is just more boring and does not show us anything new. A big disappointment for me. I'm saying all this because each time something happened in the movie I was thinking Damn again something stolen from 7 samurai.... I mean come on give us something new apart from your super last fight which was honestly over rated. The manichean pseudo moral does not go to far either. They want to kill a very very very bad guy who obviously has mental issues and they try to turn this as a good vs evil thing... The actors and the music which made 7 samurai unforgettable don't compare either. TO be honest I got bored and I thought about stopping the movie.".

Set in 1844 Japan during the Edo Period the story concerns an assassination plot that basically amounts to a suicide mission 13 samurai under the leadership of Shinzaemon Koji Yakusho have been hired out to assassinate Lord Naritsugu Goro Inagaki a sadistic young Lord to the Tokugawa shogunate. The first half of the film in what I could guess is a nod to Akira Kurosawa's epic Seven Samurai 1954 deals with the selection and recruitment of the men for this mission and the second half of the film is basically an hourlong bloodbath. Miike's reputation was made around the world with the 1999 horror film Audition. With his latest it shows that he has indeed matured as a filmmaker and is definitely ready to take on hefty subject matter  the historical samurai epic. Although there's plenty of blood and guts here Miike is more concerned with the reasons why these men are fighting and who they are exactly. Many of the samurai recruited by Shinzaemon are either too young or too old for this mission and some are more developed than others the film's only true weakness with such a significant cast but they fight anyway because they believe that if Lord Naritsugu is elected to the shogunate council it'll plunge the country into a civil war. So a great many things are at stake here the most significant of which is the very future of the country.

	schema:reviewBody "A stylised remake of a 1960's Japanese historical drama 13 Assassins focuses less here on any attempt at claiming to present hard fact and instead concentrates on the stoic camaraderie between the cast of protagonists and the eventual impossible battle they must wage against a psychopathic warlord.Director Takashi Miike is not known for tame movies and here he does not disappoint forcing the audience to confront a victim of warlord Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira's cruelty and prompting his actress to give the most heartwrenching scream I've ever heard in a film. Happily the gore is not too overthetop there are severed heads but we do not see them being severed. The only exception is an unrealistic amount of blood generated due to an exploding samurai but the irony of this becomes apparent in the end.Unlike the original portrayal of Naritsugu Gor Inagaki's portrayal is of a despot bored of peacetime life and wishing to return to the ways of war. Indeed at the end one is left with the impression that Naritsugu inflicted all of his cruelty only to create the chain of events that led to his demise although I don't believe he truly intended to die quite just yet. Kji Yakusho's Shinzaemon is stoic but identifiable portraying a leader who connects to his followers and his audience better than most I've seen in recent years if he speaks English he might want to consider a move to LA.The battle sequence is convoluted but watchable and the glimpse rendered into feudal Japan although perhaps not entirely accurate in historical terms gives one a better understanding of where Japanese culture came from.MAJOR SPOILERThere is a definite departure from reality however in the character of the guide the 12 meet in the forest the '13th Assassin' he dies several times and it quickly becomes pretty clear he's this film's interpretation the Buddhist 'Monkey God'. This leads to an amusing close as the last samurai left alive is left in disbelief when after seeing the guide run through the guide is left without even a scratch. This leaves the viewer with a mild impression the 12 had 'divine approval' of their bloody activities and ends things on a bit of a lighter note than the simple grim specter of the massacre and the irony of the feudal system where to obey was one's foremost duty regardless of the insanity of those one served.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was only a couple of years ago i saw the famous Akira Kurosawa movie  Seven Samurai for the first time. A movie that inspired other directors to make great films such as The Magnificent Seven and A fist full of Dollars and there is no doubting that 13 Assassins resembles Seven Samurai in many ways and although this will never be talked about in the same way as Kurosawa's masterpiece  i enjoyed nearly as much.It's a very simple story about a group of samurai who are out to kill an evil lord who could destroy the country if he is allowed to live.This is extremely violent and at times  especially in the first half hour  some scenes might be classed as upsetting but it's totally justified so we feel the emotion of wanting the lord dead and knowing how important it is.I have to admit i did get a little confused when so many Japanese names were being talked about at the start and the fighting did go on a little bit too long in the last half but all in all it's a good film that fans of the genre will absolutely love.".

But omitting thatyeah i know it's hard to omit that a movie labeled as horror is not scary i judge it as a very interesting film. The production design is great the glass house is a state of the art away from your typical haunted house looking both luxurious and somehow creepy at the same time. That innovation carried out with such a splendid result is worth my applause. So is the decision to make the ghosts be real actors in the set not digital freaks. Human monsters even if having to go through 4 hours of makeup sessions even if having to use a double amputee actor to play a particular ghost are the film's best trump card. There are good ideas in this film and they're very well developed. It doesn't deserve a bad score.".

It is not intended to make deep social comment it is not meant to reflect reality the characters are not obligated to exercise good judgment the fact that this movie is supposed to be based on the earlier version is not really relevant and it ought to be possible to be entertained by a movie without necessarily feeling genuinely scared.I find this to be a very entertaining movie.  Good special effects decent acting lots of action neat props and mechanicals and some unique ghosts make this a lot of fun.  Was I scared?  No.  I was startled sometimes but not scared.So what IS wrong with this movie?  Well I'm back to my usual gripe about action movies.  There's a point in the film where one character says to three other characters Stay right here until I get back. Don't touch anything.  Without going into detail let me simply state the obvious  the other characters don't obey him and the results are not good.  This is always a big turnoff to me because the people who disobey almost always end up getting out safely while other people die for their mistakes.  In another film for example a family in the Federal witness protection program is told not to contact their old friends.  The daughter however can't live without calling her boyfriend at least once.  The bad guys intercept the phone call show up at the safe house and end up killing several US Marshals.  Of course the daughter is oblivious to the damage she has caused and goes on to live happily ever after.  Just once I'd like to see the survivors turn to the person who was reckless and say That was all your fault! and blow the person away in a hail of lead.Now back to THIS film.  I recommend it if you enjoy overthetop horroraction films but not if you are looking for some sort of psychological thriller or a moody mystery.

What makes it at least interesting is the visual style of the movie. The house looks great the effects and art direction are very admirable. That there is hardly time to notice that is a shame.

Something is missing I can't point a finger to EXACTLY what it is but I know if it were included this movie would have been a blockbuster.It's a great Halloween popcorn film. It's entertaining. It's a nice attempt at an update of a movie that wasn't that hot to begin with. I liked the actors I just wish they had more to work with. I really liked the Ghosts I wished they were developed more had more exposuretime onscreen and were a little bit more gruesome. Only a few ghosts out of the 12 got featured I felt shortchanged.Maybe there was too much about the family for me..then again maybe too little. Maybe the family didn't have enough goosebumpy peril for me. I REALLY liked the daughter washing her face in the new bathroom scene. Maybe there should have been ALOT more of that kind of suspensehorror. I loved what happened to the Lawyer. I HATED the ending it just fell apart for me. But I loved the Nanny's closing line at the end and I think it would have been more effective if the film was a whole lot scarier and gruesome. I have to wonder is there stuff on the editing floor that didn't make it?I watch this film everytime it comes on CableTV for it IS interesting and there are parts that are good. Then there are parts that ruin it. Character development that has plot holes as big as the grand canyon. It was as if they wanted to make a horrific scary ghost movie and just when they were about to let go they pulled back. But ya know you can still watch it and be entertained.Thir13en Ghosts 2? Only if the makers the scriptwriter etc. are allowed to let go and its released with the sheer horror fear gruesome tale it looks like it was headed in.I know it may offend alot of folks if Thir13en Ghosts went that ballsout route but for what we're paying to get into movie houses now...do me a favor and scare the hell outa me!!! I can take it!!! Make me jump out of my seat ALOT...scream...grab onto my boyfriend andor whomever else is sitting nearby! Trust me I'll come back for more.This film had all the elements in place and it just petered out.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the original 13 Ghosts when I was 12 years old and it scared me half to death. They gave you a viewer so when the ghosts appeared on screen you looked thru one color and could see them but if you looked thru the other color you couldn't see them. Now that I see that movie again I wonder what I was scared of. But I loved all of William Castle's movies. He was the master of gimmicks and chills in his day. Now comes a new version of the old story packed with gore and shocks galore in living color. No glasses or special optical device handed out at the theater this time. The film hits you with a punch to the senses in the opening scenes before settling down to a poor man struggling to make ends meet after the tragic death of his wife. He later learns that his dear wife's ghost has been captured by his eccentric uncle and is kept in a special cage in the basement. While vastly different from the original this film can stand on its own. It is a complete retelling of the story with great action special fx acting and a few laughs thrown in as well as some references to the original. If you are just looking for some mindless supernatural fun and maybe even a moral love is stronger than evil this film is for you.".

Thir13en Ghosts works around that by giving the protagonists special glasses which allow them to see the ghosts.  It's a lot less goofy than seeing it written in this review makes it sound and it means that the movie doesn't have to be shot in the depths of night.Second the story was up to the task and original.

It makes you sick to the back teeth because it's just that bad or it makes you twitch every time you see in the paper that Thir13en Ghosts is on. I myself fall into the latter category. I loved every second of this film! I saw this a few weeks back I was bored and I was flicking stations on TV. Luckily the film was only just starting. The scrapyard scene had me hooked. One downside to this was that Cyrus Kriticos F. Murray Abraham got killed off quite quickly. I would have liked to see a little more about his past but then that would be trailing from the path of this story. Notwithstanding the very feel that this film gave me was astounding. The makeup on all the ghosts had me looking away at times. I thought it quite strange that the ghost we saw the most of was naked to the eye there should have been a bit of camerashare there. As we are really starting to get into this story we find out that Kalina Embeth Davidtz the woman who is also trapped in the house is actually helping the ghost of Cyrus. A small problem there is he dead or not? He had a chunk of metal wrapped around his neck yet he can be seen without the ghostseeing glasses. Perhaps it's just me I may have had my fingers clasped around my eyes.Brilliant film I completely recommend this for anyone who wants a good fright and some small laughs.".

Murray Abraham  a very rich collector of unique things dies he leaves it all to his nephew and his family. All including his house his fortune and his malicious collection of ghosts. As reclusive Dr. Zorba has died and left his eerie mansion to his penniless nephew Cyrus Zorba Tony Shaloub and his sons Shannon Elizabeth  Alec Roberts . Along with the house the Zorba family has also inherited the occultist's collection of 12 ghosts Laura Mennell as The Bound Woman  Kathryn Anderson as The Withered Lover  Craig Olejnik as The Torn Prince  Shawna Loyer as The Angry Princess  Xantha Radley as The Pilgrimess  Ernst Harth as The Great Child  Laurie Soper as The Dire Mother  Herbert Duncanson as The Hammer who can only be seen through Zorba's special goggles.The house suddenly closes itself and they encounter trapped inside and soon supernatural creepiness begin frightening the hosts . Then they'll spend a ghastly night in the spooky house with killingsladen history . The family members their lives at risk upon the discovery a strange book that lies hidden somewhere in the house  they receive aid from unexpected woman Embeth Davidtz as the threat to their lives is revealed .This eerie story contains bit good fun with grisly killing  relentless horror and lots of blood and gore. The chiller version packs genuine chills and terrifying deaths such as a horrible quartering . It's silly but amusing fun and with an excessive use of computer generator FX and special makeup in charge of Robert Kurtzman  Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero . The monstrous ghosts are the real stars of this production  being rightly realized by means of an excellent makeup and magnificent special effects . Some scenes are clumsily shot but the movie has some good moments here and there  the illogical parts in the argument are more than compensated for the excitement provided by the creepy ghosts . The film was lavishly produced by Dark Castle  production specialized on terror genre and in charge of Joel Silver  Robert Zemeckis and Gilbert Adler  both of them have produced successful terror movies dealing with eerie tales about horror  grisly killings and lots of blood and gore such as House of haunted hill Return to house of haunted hill  Gothika Ghost ship House of wax  Whiteout  Splice  The reaping  Orphan  among others . The motion picture was professionally directed though without originality by Steven Beck who subsequently filmed Ghost ship. The film resulted to be an acceptable but inferior remake from superior 13 ghosts by William Castle . It was plenty of gimmicks leaps from the screen and surprises descending on cinemagoers such as hidden wires and others . Of course the biggest film about this astonishing story is this vintage 1960 classic version rendition by William Castle that was starred by Charles Herbert as Buck Zorba  Jo Morrow as Medea Zorba  Martin Milner as Benjamen Rush  Rosemary DeCamp as Hilda Zorba and Donald Woods as Cyrus Zorba .".

As reclusive Dr. Zorba has died and left his eerie mansion to his penniless nephew Cyrus Zorba Tony Shaloub and his sons Shannon Elizabeth  Alec Roberts . Along with the house the Zorba family has also inherited the occultist's collection of 12 ghosts Laura Mennell as The Bound Woman  Kathryn Anderson as The Withered Lover  Craig Olejnik as The Torn Prince  Shawna Loyer as The Angry Princess  Xantha Radley as The Pilgrimess  Ernst Harth as The Great Child  Laurie Soper as The Dire Mother  Herbert Duncanson as The Hammer who can only be seen through Zorba's special goggles.The house suddenly closes itself and they encounter trapped inside and soon supernatural creepiness begin frightening the hosts . Then they'll spend a ghastly night in the spooky house with killingsladen history . The family members their lives at risk upon the discovery a strange book that lies hidden somewhere in the house  they receive aid from unexpected woman Embeth Davidtz as the threat to their lives is revealed .This eerie story contains bit good fun with grisly killing  relentless horror and lots of blood and gore. The chiller version packs genuine chills and terrifying deaths such as a horrible quartering . It's silly but amusing fun and with an excessive use of computer generator FX and special makeup in charge of Robert Kurtzman  Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero . The monstrous ghosts are the real stars of this production  being rightly realized by means of an excellent makeup and magnificent special effects . Some scenes are clumsily shot but the movie has some good moments here and there  the illogical parts in the argument are more than compensated for the excitement provided by the creepy ghosts . The film was lavishly produced by Dark Castle  production specialized on terror genre and in charge of Joel Silver  Robert Zemeckis and Gilbert Adler  both of them have produced successful terror movies dealing with eerie tales about horror  grisly killings and lots of blood and gore such as House of haunted hill Return to house of haunted hill  Gothika Ghost ship House of wax  Whiteout  Splice  The reaping  Orphan  among others . The motion picture was professionally directed though without originality by Steven Beck who subsequently filmed Ghost ship. The film resulted to be an acceptable but inferior remake from superior 13 ghosts by William Castle . It was plenty of gimmicks leaps from the screen and surprises descending on cinemagoers such as hidden wires and others . Of course the biggest film about this astonishing story is this vintage 1960 classic version rendition by William Castle that was starred by Charles Herbert as Buck Zorba  Jo Morrow as Medea Zorba  Martin Milner as Benjamen Rush  Rosemary DeCamp as Hilda Zorba and Donald Woods as Cyrus Zorba .";

Although I'm not a horror film fan I do like a good suspense and shock film if intelligently presented or just plain entertaining.This however is none of these things.Surely a requirement of a horror film is to actually SCARE you right? Why is it then that not one scene in this film is geared towards doing that. True some of the ghosts antics might make you go ewww in mild disgust but it's all handled so poorly you find yourself switching off 15 minutes into the film.It's a crying shame because the actual plot is a great one  some mad old nut traps ghosts in his house in order to power some diabolical machine. Sounds good on paper and the machine and house itself actually looks great on the screen too.But the ghosts weren't the only souless things in the building where on earth did they dragup such a dumb and dumber cast? I was actually rooting for the little kid to get sliced. Some of the ghosts look like they could be truly terrifying given a chance but what do we get? Some nutcase with a cage on his head slashing around for a bit and a naked Carrie covered in lipstick sorry slash wounds. The interesting looking ones do very little other than stand and watch the cast try and flee from them.All in all I can't actually think of a single good thing to the film. It has just 1 twist to the plot which in itself is quite predictable truly average effects no scares whatsoever dull acting and a dull ending.Has to be one of the only movies I've ever seen where I enjoyed watching the trailers before more than the actual movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "13 GHOSTS  2001  out of fourI'll admit that I'm a sucker for haunted house movies. I forbid a guilty pleasure watching miscellaneous characters roam through dark creepy hallways and walk through ominous corridors as vicious evil lurks behind closed doors and observes from the shadows. The characters' fates are never in question but it's a lot of fun watching them meet a gruesome demise.I enjoy this kind of film so much that I even found a soft spot for House on Haunted Hill and The Haunting 1999's critically mauled haunted house movies. Naturally I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of 13 Ghosts a stateoftheart remake of the 1960's William Castle horror film of the same name. Warner Bros. released it the weekend before Halloween and they couldn't have picked a better time. In 1999 House on Haunted Hill broke boxoffice records when released on the same weekend. All that aside 13 Ghosts will be a major disappointment to even diehard fans of the genre like myself. The film perspires with potential scares complete with an intriguing premise a tantalizing trailer and an astonishing visual appearance. Unfortunately the screenplay drops dead on arrival filled with enough recycled moments and cluncky onedimensional dialogue to wake the dead. This movie is a wasted opportunity.The film stars Tony Shalhoub as Arthur Kriticos the widowed father of two children Kathy American Pie's Shannon Elizabeth and preteen Bobby Alec Roberts. As the movie opens the family faces tragedy as a fire burns down their house and kills Arthur's wife. They are left with nothing.Nothing that is until Arthur inherits a unique house from his late eccentric uncle Cyrus F. Murray Abraham. The house is a masterpiece of modern architecture. Made entirely of glass and steel antique treasures fill the rooms strange machines gears cranks and big glass chambers position themselves throughout. The family can't believe their good fortune nor do they believe a mysterious character when he tries to explain the house is haunted. Like most haunted house movies 13 Ghosts works best when the characters explore the mansion completely unaware of the danger that awaits. Too bad this kind of sequence only inhabits but a few moments of the already short movie. With a running time of only 88 minutes everything feels rushed contrived and astonishingly brief. Talk about rushing things. This movie pounds us with moments of loud noises and violent encounters. If the film would have developed an ominous atmosphere and obeyed the rules of haunted house movies then the rapidfire violence may have worked to some extent. But we just don't get that here.Prosthetics specialists must have had a field day with this movie. Contrary to the title there are twelve different ghosts in this movie. We admire the makeup and special effects department when we see the masterfully crafted ghouls. But when we do see them it's through quick brief flashes. The editing is choppy brief and visually incoherent. It's like director Steve Beck wanted the ghosts to be special effects instead of a solid physical presence. Big mistake.   13 Ghosts will not win any awards for composition. The  overuse of slowmotion photography quickly becomes a nuisance. The editing photography tricks and computer animation techniques often feel misplaced. However even if the film was masterfully constructed a good technical department does not make up for the lack of a sufficient script.But no! 13 Ghosts is too concerned with pleasing audiences and providing us with comic relief. Relief from what? The film does squeeze in a few decent horrific moments but for the most part it is not that scary. If the film was 88 minutes of pure edgeofyourseat suspense and horror I can see why comic relief might be in order. But with 13 Ghosts we deserve more than comic relief we deserve a better movie entirely.".

	schema:reviewBody "While anyone must admit that the original 13 Ghosts was no masterpiece it stands as a monumental achievement in filmmaking when compared to this reeking plotless mess. Aside from a funny line here and there this movie shows no discernible quality that makes it worth watching. Sure the implausible mechanical glass house with the allegedly Latin inscriptions on the walls is rather interesting to look at but unfortunately glimpses of it are interrupted and marred by the silly film that keeps intruding.Scenes of gratuitous gore actually become quite silly. Take for instance the scene in which one character I won't say who is sliced in half by a set of apparently razorsharp doors. Folks this is strictly adolescent fare at best. I can picture it now a room full of 15yearolds my apologies at this point to intelligent 15yearolds everywhere for these filmmakers are below you guffawing and saying things like Dude wouldn't it be like totally cool if his head just like explodes spewing brains and s everywhere?! That would be like so awesome. We should have one guy like get cut in half you know.I'm sorry but my patience has really been worn thin by misplaced attempts at creating horror. Horror is not about seeing people cut in half by glass doors or about seeing mutilated corpses in bathtubs full of blood. It's about suspense which this film tragically possesses little of. It's just one ugly scene of gratuitous gore violence andor nudity after another. It seems that Beck's idea was merely to throw graphic scenes at his audience in rapidfire fashion in an effort to terrorize or sicken them none of which he achieves. I found myself laughing at scenes that were supposed to be shocking. I laughed because I could not take them seriously. It was like watching a film made by juveniles for juveniles based on what they thought would be awesome or scary.Simply put this movie is just far too stupid to be scary or the least bit suspenseful. Even the opening scene is too overdone to be taken seriously and it goes downhill from there.I watched the original 13 Ghosts when I was a child and I remember thinking it was a really spooky movie. When it recently aired on TV I sat up late and watched it and even though I didn't find it quite as scary as I remembered I thoroughly enjoyed the campiness of it. The original film at least does offer some truly suspenseful scenes and actually possesses a plot that intrigues and engages the audience. When it was over I thought to myself that it would be really neat if it were remade. Sadly I have discovered this is not true. With filmmakers like Beck running amok old classics and pseudoclassics are best left alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you expect little more from a film than good specialeffects then you may find this film worthy of your time. If however you value character depth along with an interesting storyline I suggest that you not spend your time watching this film. First the characters in this film are very flat all of whom embody the values typical of what the moderately educated middleclass place so high a reverence and desire for all things that on the surface seem worthy of attaining money. More specifically you have the 'caring yet bumbling Dad just trying to secure a future for his family' 'the hot and naive teenage daughter' whom because of her good looks we are supposed to pity when she is unjustly assaulted by one of the ghosts  'the mouthy Negro woman who 'tells it like it is'' and of course 'the sketchy character of the family that cannot be trusted' namely the rich uncle.The storyline of the film is told before the backdrop of these lame characters. And as if the plot were not already predictable it is then explained to the viewer TWICE! The result is devastating for the movement of the plot as any interesting ending it could have had is laid bare for the viewer. The reason for this selfsabotage suggests that the makers of this film either believe its viewers to be completely stupid or have no clear idea how to tell a story with an eye to holding the audience's interest. This is not a work of art as good cinema is but just a collection of archetypal characters supporting a very tired and weak formulaic storyline. The specialeffects are fairly good but they can and never will be a replacement for rounded characters an interesting storyline and artful scripting. Leave this film on the shelf.".

	onyx:emotionText "If you expect little more from a film than good specialeffects then you may find this film worthy of your time. If however you value character depth along with an interesting storyline I suggest that you not spend your time watching this film. First the characters in this film are very flat all of whom embody the values typical of what the moderately educated middleclass place so high a reverence and desire for all things that on the surface seem worthy of attaining money. More specifically you have the 'caring yet bumbling Dad just trying to secure a future for his family' 'the hot and naive teenage daughter' whom because of her good looks we are supposed to pity when she is unjustly assaulted by one of the ghosts  'the mouthy Negro woman who 'tells it like it is'' and of course 'the sketchy character of the family that cannot be trusted' namely the rich uncle.The storyline of the film is told before the backdrop of these lame characters. And as if the plot were not already predictable it is then explained to the viewer TWICE! The result is devastating for the movement of the plot as any interesting ending it could have had is laid bare for the viewer. The reason for this selfsabotage suggests that the makers of this film either believe its viewers to be completely stupid or have no clear idea how to tell a story with an eye to holding the audience's interest. This is not a work of art as good cinema is but just a collection of archetypal characters supporting a very tired and weak formulaic storyline. The specialeffects are fairly good but they can and never will be a replacement for rounded characters an interesting storyline and artful scripting. Leave this film on the shelf.";

The film though did have its good bits as well as the bad bits. Some things were done ingeniously such as the glasses as when you would put them on you could see them or with the role of the psychic played by Mathew Lillard who I must say once again performed brilliantly in this role as he does with his other movies. The way the ghosts were captured was cleverly done and most of them were very well costumized and they looked the scary part but others didn't.

	schema:reviewBody "13 Semesters is a German Germanlanguage movie from 2009 so it has its 7th anniversary this year. The director is Frieder Wittich and he also worked the film together with Oliver Ziegenbalg. For Wittich these slightly under 100 minutes are probably his most known work but Ziegenbalg worked on a handful other somewhat known films some of them starring German actor Matthias Schweighfer. And you can definitely make a parallel between Schweighfer and Max Riemelt the lead actor in this film we have here. Riemelt is a couple years younger than the more known Schweighfer but in my opinion Riemelt is the far superior actor especially when it comes to dramatic moments. This performance he gave here is a perfect example of how to act in a film that is a mix of drama and comedy. Apart from Riemelt there are more rising star actors in here such as Robert Gwisdek son of Michael Alexander Fehling Amit Shaw and for male audiences Claudia Eisinger who is not only incredibly easy on the eye but also gives a very good film and that's crucial because she is really the only major female actor in here.This is the story of Moritz and the title already indicates that it is about what happens to him during the over 6 years of studies of business arithmetic. But it is not really about the studies itself. Despite recurring references these are just the frame for his relationships to friends and Eisinger's character who plays his love interest. You can probably call it a bit of a comingofage film even if the main character may be slightly too old for that description if you are very strict. But lets not be. It is tough to say what the best thing about this film was. But in the face of Riemelt's and Eisinger strong performances I'd still give the edge to the script. It feels realistic funny relevant and dramatic from start to finish. I never had the impression that I was watching fictitious people or characters that do not really exist. It felt like these people could really be anybody. And with the nonspectacular events in a film like this it is always a challenge to make it interesting enough that I care for the people in here. Frieder Wittich definitely succeeded with that. The film never drags and I was genuinely curious about how the characters would evolve as the film kept running. Sure there aren't really any great or outstanding moments in here and it's not a contender for best film of the year but it does not need to be. It's still very entertaining all the time and I recommend the watch. Thumbs up.".

They're taking you someplace you never would have guessed not in a hundred years. Second  it is a superb film. Great story well told. A low budget film that does not seem at all low budget. Also a good film for a student of film. A very good example a minimalist approach. The director very much lets the story tell itself. The camera is very unobtrusive. There is no artificial manipulation of the emotions by music sound or special fx. Every thing is low key just a little excitement by some key actors just as it would be. Great film making? Yes taught tense exciting nerve racking.Also a great example of how you can still make a great film without a lot of blood gore or sex. What?..... your thinking.... how can you do that? Watch the film and find out.How low budget is this? One suspects it was shot in b  w more for budgetary reasons than style. However this director demonstrates such a mastery of his craft that it may be intentional. For which ever reason it works.Good casting too even though there was a little nepotism. Even the fat guy was well cast.Last as another critic advised the less you know going into this film the better. However I give this one piece of information Tzameti means '13' in Georgian as in the Caucasus's not the United States..... So the title reads 13.13. Even this makes sense if you note three things..Sit back and enjoy.... although later you'll be on the edge of your seat.".

Yes taught tense exciting nerve racking.Also a great example of how you can still make a great film without a lot of blood gore or sex. What?..... your thinking.... how can you do that? Watch the film and find out.How low budget is this? One suspects it was shot in b  w more for budgetary reasons than style. However this director demonstrates such a mastery of his craft that it may be intentional. For which ever reason it works.Good casting too even though there was a little nepotism. Even the fat guy was well cast.Last as another critic advised the less you know going into this film the better. However I give this one piece of information Tzameti means '13' in Georgian as in the Caucasus's not the United States..... So the title reads 13.13. Even this makes sense if you note three things..Sit back and enjoy.... although later you'll be on the edge of your seat.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm so grateful for having seen this movie on the silver screen. It's an amazingly dark film in the style of Man Bites Dog and it also has some elements of Eli Roth's Hostel. If you like movies with that dark atmosphere don't miss this one! A young man who is hired to fix up an old house finds a mysterious letter that has instructions. When he decides to follow them more letters and instructions follow and eventually he ends up in a house in the middle of the woods where he and others have to face a difficult task in order to please the rich. If the word IF is very important he survives he gets a lot of money. I'd love to tell you more about it but it would ruin the surprise.At the end when you're watching the credits I think you'll feel more satisfied than watching any American movie. This one has an ending it can't have a sequel. The ending is quite ironical it's been a while since a movie really surprised me with that. It's amazing what kinds of risks nonAmerican movie makers take what they put their characters through.The cinematography was also surprising it's a black and white movie very stylish filmnoir like. Artsy but not at all MTVlike. Once you get into the story you'll begin to love the black and white it's been such a good decision and it adds to the atmosphere.I had never seen a Georgian movie before so i was very excited and all my wishes came true. It was way better than i expected and when it's out on DVD I'll rent it again or buy it that's for sure.One last thing if Gla Babluani's writing and directing a movie again i hope it will be as awesome dark and surprising again! He could be the Georgian Tarantino. 1010".

	schema:headline " Your man kills a third and there'll be a bonus for you13 Tzameti";
	schema:reviewBody "If you desire to see an edge of your seat thriller definitely take the opportunity to go downtown to the Market Arcade Theatre and check out the enthralling Frenchlanguage 13 Tzameti while you still have the opportunity. This film is a debut that any veteran director would love to have included in hisher filmography. A minimalist film in terms of dialogue and set the real magic lies in the performances. Each character has his life on the line at some point during the proceedings whether it physically monetarily or emotionally. The closest film I can compare it to is the final half hour of Eli Roth's Hostel only with tension amped up to the extreme and the gratuity of gore and sex turned down to an almost non entity. By showing reactions to and only short bursts of violence director Gla Babluani has created a masterclass in the school of less is more. Whereas Roth went for the outlandish grossout effects Babluani sticks with reality and it is that much more effective as a result.While all the acting is topnotch in terms of expressing the weight of the world trouble laid on almost every character's shoulders our star Sbastien played by George Babluani really stands out. He starts out as a young laborer capable and taking pride in the job he is doing. His family at home really needs the money this job will soon afford hopefully to take some pressure off his gimp brother who seems to only have time to sleep when he is not hard at work. Sbastien soon realizes that his employer is not well mentally or financially. He overhears a conversation while working on his employer's roof that besides fronting the advance for his construction work the old man really doesn't have the money for anything else and is not sure he can do the task awaiting him again. This task is given through a striped envelope containing a train ticket and paid hotel room. Circumstances soon play out which leave young Sbastien broke and in possession of said letter whose conversations around seem to show a bountiful of wealth upon receipt. The desperate times call for him to go in his employer's place without any knowledge of what he will have to do in order to bring some money back to his family.George Babluani gives an emotionally draining performance transforming from a hopeful boy with work to a broken heap of nerves fighting for his life knowing that his only hope for survival will be to kill at least one other human being. As the film's trailer showed the task at hand is joining an underground gambling event of Russian Roulette with a twist. Your gun is pressed against the back of the head of the man standing next to you. When the light above turns on everyone shoots there can be only one victor after the three rounds and final duel. But don't look in the others' eyes it is much harder to pull the trigger on someone whose soul is bare than the matted down sweat drenched hair motionlessly dead ahead. These actors are battling the nerves to not only stay alive but also deal with being a murderer in order to survive. Babluani the director shows us such realism that you almost believe these men have real guns in their hands playing God while their handlers wait in the adjacent room to see if their millions have been betted on the luckiest man. The final duel is painful to watch seeing these men resolved to tears and a need of forgiveness knowing what they will have to do.While the contest is the crux of the film it is not the only trial needing to be overcome. We have police on the hunt for the hideout to put a stop to the games and we have handlers with novices who have never shot a gunthey must put the unknown players in because they will be fined if not and if for some reason that person brought the police they'd be considered the rat if they left before a raid. The stakes are high the outcome always looking bleak. As a viewer you have no idea where the story will take you next no one is special and everyone's life hangs by a thread. The gorgeous black and white cinematography helps keep you on edge viewing through sharp angles and thick grain adding to the tension and heart pounding action unraveling itself on screen. I almost can't wait to see the Hollywood remake which has been recently greenlit for development just to see how they ruin an amazing feat of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "This file is highly overrated. I can only think of a few possibilities why that is. First of all this probably is due to the fact that people are more reluctant to criticize world cinema or maybe it is simply that people are misled by the file being shot in blackandwhite. I really don't know. What I do know is that the script itself is not very original. Tzameti is an Intacto which by the way scores lower on IMDb than Tzameti which is a bit of a disgrace with Deerhunter ingredients. Because these are great movies this shouldn't be much of a problem. But only when all the other ingredients compensate this lack of originality. This isn't the case. The acting performances are poor. The acting as well as the plot does show the motivation of the people in the movie who are involved in the game. While Intacto leaves you wondering if 'in the real world' one man's luck is the other man's misfortune Tzameti leaves you with nothing at all or maybe the question 'why are these people in it?'. This is far to little for a real good movie. Furthermore the music is annoying far too much clich thriller stuff. The plot especially in the beginning is very soap like e.g when the letter is put on the table in front of the open window the viewer already knows it will blow away and later Sebastian clumsily runs into the letter. The plot also isn't very believable the way the police loses track of the main character on the way to the game the gamers with loaded guns in their hands while the gamblers stand around them the way the main character listens through the open roof to a conversation and none of the people conversating notices the open roof with the wind blowing through it. There are though a few positive points the tension at the start of the game with the light bulb and the good acting performance of Pascal Bongard but it is all too little to say this is a good movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gela Balbuani writer and director of 13 Tzameti has probably seen more than few Noirs from the 1950s but his work here also makes for other comparisons as well. His film has that air of doom and detached almost cold despair that reminds one of a JeanPierre Melville film. There is also the element from Melville of characters who 'do' more than talk as the slightest or most obvious expressions tell everything we as the audience need to know. But the subject matter is a lot closer to that of at least a few cult films as of late that have basically a story gimmick that is taken very seriously. But unlike Fincher's the Game where the stylistic flair is part of the artificial nature of the content or Fukasaku's Battle Royal a film I thought of a couple of times midway through this film where the nihilism is so over the top it becomes comical 13 Tzameti is shot in stark gritty black and white photography. This is not simply done I think for the filmmaker to get in his 'oldschool' kicks from those hardboiled noirs from America and even France. The story unfolds without much complexity but with enough ambiguity early on to make an impact midway through. Sebastien George Balbuani in his first film role under director Gela's directorial debut finds that his neighbor JeanLouis Passon in a good if alltooshort performance has killed himself in his own bathtub from an overdose. For a reason that is made clear though not precise money for his immigrant family and possibly just curiosity he decides to follow the lead of a package of instructions left for JeanLouis which takes him through various channels of travel across the country even as he's being tailed by the police. Like in Eyes Wide Shut Sebastien is the bemused eventually awfully affected outsider this case in a group of people who watch bet or participate in a sort of 'game' where rich old Frenchmen bet thousands on who will die or kill in three rounds where thirteen contestants have to load up one gun a piece and fire it at the other's head in a dominotype line. The game becomes the centerpiece of the film where morphine and alcohol gets slammed down and shot up inbetween the rounds and the game itself becomes as captivating as the participants and on both sides of the volunteer killers and onlookers bring on an unnerving sense of doom and it pervades the film up until the end.The logic behind the technical style one where Meliava's absence of handheld photography and wavering closeups and highangle shots in the 'shooting' scenes creates a world devoid of a sense of humor and one that completely sustains the tone of the film. On top of this the musical accompaniment is only on occasion with the midsection The acting also corresponds with this style as the performances are all very realistic and Balbuani particularly has a lot to carry as the protagonist. His character halfway through goes through a change from being a nottoospecial contemplative young guy to being traumatized with this special roulettelike competition and finally into something of the walking dead in his some of his mannerisms. For a firsttime performance under a firsttime director it's a turn that reminds me speaking of French films from days gone by of a JeanPierre Leaud with a face and demeanor that can only hide so much before the emotional toll of the character finally comes through. It's an uncompromising film with a violent desperate core where the fates are against all involved in the game with little hope in sight. That it won't be for everyone is not a surprise but it has an appeal that might someday make it into a cultmovie and it's got a psychological edge that has me already ready to watch it again.".

	schema:headline " A brilliant suspense film that I absolutely hated to watch!";
	schema:reviewBody "The film begins with a roofer working at a home of a man who seems to be a hardcore drug addict living out his final days. Several times during the first 13 of the film the guy looks like death warmed over and eventually he does die from an overdose. Just before he dies a letter arrives that somehow means the potential for BIG moneybut exactly what it is and how he was to have earned it is unclear. The roofer on a lark steals the letter. Later it turns out there are instructions for where to go as well as a train ticketbut what this big moneymaking opportunity is is never clearthough you can safely assume it will be dangerous and illegal. After all why else would anyone offer a dying addict this opportunity?! I really don't want to say more but this film is amazingly intelligent in its writing but will most likely turn the stomachs or cause very negative reactions in many viewers. Be advised that you may want to bow out midway through the filmthat's okay. Too bad the roofer couldn't.As Ricky Ricardo was fond of saying to Lucy You got some 'splaining to do when it comes to my summary. How could the movie earn an 8 and yet be a film I hated watching?! On the surface this doesn't make any sense. Well here's whyI don't particularly like violent movies and this is one of the most violent and upsetting films I have seen in a long long time. Now the violence isn't like a John Woo or Sylvester Stallone filmwhere you have tons of explosions and gunfire. Instead it's very up close and very personaland frankly this made it very disturbing. By comparison it was much more disturbing and difficult to watch than SWEENEY TODD. Exactly how and why it was so disturbing I really don't want to say as it really would hinder the suspensejust take my word for it that this is NOT a film for kids or even teens to watch and most adults would also flinch at the extreme violence. Now this isn't to say it was gratuitousthe film makers used black and white film and really underplayed the blood but it still made be turn my head from time to timebut the violence was still THAT intense.".

	onyx:emotionText "The film begins with a roofer working at a home of a man who seems to be a hardcore drug addict living out his final days. Several times during the first 13 of the film the guy looks like death warmed over and eventually he does die from an overdose. Just before he dies a letter arrives that somehow means the potential for BIG moneybut exactly what it is and how he was to have earned it is unclear. The roofer on a lark steals the letter. Later it turns out there are instructions for where to go as well as a train ticketbut what this big moneymaking opportunity is is never clearthough you can safely assume it will be dangerous and illegal. After all why else would anyone offer a dying addict this opportunity?! I really don't want to say more but this film is amazingly intelligent in its writing but will most likely turn the stomachs or cause very negative reactions in many viewers. Be advised that you may want to bow out midway through the filmthat's okay. Too bad the roofer couldn't.As Ricky Ricardo was fond of saying to Lucy You got some 'splaining to do when it comes to my summary. How could the movie earn an 8 and yet be a film I hated watching?! On the surface this doesn't make any sense. Well here's whyI don't particularly like violent movies and this is one of the most violent and upsetting films I have seen in a long long time. Now the violence isn't like a John Woo or Sylvester Stallone filmwhere you have tons of explosions and gunfire. Instead it's very up close and very personaland frankly this made it very disturbing.

But it is the most pointless dullest piece of trash I have seen for a long time. I really cannot write much about it without giving away the plot. It tries to be utterly pure like some of Antonioni's or Claude Chabrol's movies or from more recent times those of Francoise Ozon but ends up a meaningless waste of celluloid time and money. It lacks a wellestablished context and is violent beyond comprehension. It is l'art pour l'art violence there is no point in it no intrinsic moral lesson nothing. Even the worst thrillers and action flicks have some aspiration to convey some message even if they fail to do so. They have a few twists and turns and a feeble attempt to entertain or to deter but 13 Tzameti offers nothing. Director Gla Babluani thought it was going to be very stylish and artistic to shoot in good old black and white anyway but it is rather pretentious instead. Outrageously so.Sometimes negative criticism can be a good omen but not in this case. Censorship can never be justified but if you go watch this one you will wonder how it made it to movie theaters. Would my homemade pseudoartistic shocker I shot with a 16mm I bought at the dime store also make it? Believe me it is a fairly justifiable question here.

I came to the conclusion after watching the film that it is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I didn't expect a face off style action flick or anything but my God nothing really happened for the first half an hour and there was very little characterisation. On the plus side it is tastefully shot and is quite well directed however how much this was due to the black and white aspect making me feel like it was more high brow than it was I'm not sure. The attraction of this film is clearly the violence and tension of the Russian roulette scenes the fact that human life can be so easily discarded and that men are willing to lay down their lives for money in a game of chance. However we do not get the impression that the main character is worth saving. He is not really put in context and I cannot see a rational human being which he appears to be realising he has got himself into a Russian roulette competition and continuing to stay no matter how much money is involved. The Russian roulette scenes are very tense the faceless room and stark light bulb adding to the tension. But it is blatantly obvious that our 'hero' is going to survive the game which completely ruins the tension. Furthermore I found myself wanting him to die so that the film would be over sooner. All the filming outside of the roulette seemed to be a waste of time as we get to know no one except the main character. I won't spoil the end of the film but needless to say you see it coming a mile off. All in all this film was predictable incredibly dull and did nothing new. You could as others seem to have done try and intellectualise this movie but it really isn't worthy of that sort of analysis. The controversial theme of the film will be enough to carry it despite it being rubbish. A guy plays Russian roulette and wins big deal. Dull dull dull!".

This is actually the first intelligent smart and wonderfully acted film of the year and both Patricia Clarkson and Chris Cooper give wonderful performances in a story which is intriguingly told and compellingly filmed.I will agree with a few others that Pierce Brosnan seems a bit miscast in this picture but not to the point that it ruins the film. Additionally some of Rachel McAdams' dialogue seems a bit out of place for a character like her's during the period in which this story is set it is supposed to take place in 1949 but she gives a great performance overall and her character is for the most part other than a few bad bits of out of place dialogue fairly believable.But Cooper and Clarkson are really wonderful in this film and Ira Sachs and company have done a terrific job with this story. Bravo.".

After seeing Patricia Clarkson in Far From Heaven I was anxious to see her play in this period again.I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film. At first I didn't know what to make of it or where it was going. It is a dark comedy. The twists and turns of the film are completely unexpected. It kept me on my toes and the 4 lead performances were great.Without going into the synopsis too much you can find that anywhere if I had to compare this film to another..... I'd say it's kind of a darker funnier Closer but set in the early 50's.What I found interesting about the film is that it was incredibly complex wellwritten characters in very complex situations set in a very simple time.Let's talk about Patricia Clarkson for a minute. This is an actress who should've been nominated for several Supporting Actress Oscars by now. The Green Mile All The Real Girls Far From Heaven Lars and the Real Girl.. to name a few. I hope she finally gets some recognition as the Leading Actress in this film.Rachel McAdams This proves her acting abilities. She is incredible in this film. She is so beautiful subtle and so commanding. Definitely her most mature role to date.Of course I expect nothing less from Oscarwinner Chris Cooper. This proves to me though that he can carry a film and not just be a strong supporting character.Brosnan is great too in the least meaty I'd say of the 4 leading roles. He is very suave but also provides some unexpected comic relief.Great film! Go and see this.".

Period details are rendered with loving carewhether it is the glorious costumes or the sweeping set design. Performances are top notch  a true ensemble cast who look and sound like they are from a bygone era. A rich score magnifies the shifting moods without giving you whiplash.

	schema:reviewBody "The biggest problem with MARRIED LIFE the movie not the state of existence is the tone set by its title. Before even setting foot in the theatre your mind is filled with preconceived notions about the likelihoods the film will deliver. You cannot expect a film called MARRIED LIFE to show long term couples just as happy now as they were when they first met. In fact in these cynical times you might likely be disappointed if you didn't see spouses abusing each other scheming and plotting against the other or if you want to be old fashioned just plain cheating on each other. Perhaps to offset these expectations writerdirector Ira Sachs sets his story in the 1940's a supposedly simpler time when people were married and stayed that way despite their personal unhappiness. Even a setting as delicately composed as this one is not a good enough disguise for its contemporary sensibility. The film's fate seems sealed as soon as the opening credits begin to roll. Similar in design and manner to television's Desperate Housewives a show that has built its reputation on couples scheming they seem to announce Sach's intention to give us exactly what we expect. Only when the final animated frame settles on a city skyline and you expect the real thing to take its place Sachs reveals that it is in fact a reflection. With the lens pointing inward now I wonder if I've spoken too soon.Like the beginning of a marriage for a while it is good. The strings of the score swell and sweep you up into the sentiment like a warm wind taking you for a dance in the sky overlooking a quiet familyfriendly suburban street. This particular street is home to Harry and Pat Allen Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson. The two have been married for what might as well be forever and they still cherish and respect each other but whether they still love each other is a question that looms over their lives like a heavy cloud. Harry believes that love is defined by the desire to give constantly to the other person. Pat believes that love is sex. Despite their definitions being categorically on different pages they are a solid functional couple. However Harry has found another woman Kay Rachel McAdams in a refreshing return that is more tender and vulnerable than past performances for whom continuously being doted on is the perfect compliment to her lonely life. I suppose it doesn't hurt that she is younger and beautiful but Harry conveniently avoids seeing this as the motivating factor for his affection.And so Harry finds himself in quite the pickle. He doesn't want to burden his wife with the embarrassment of a divorce but yet he cannot deny that he is no longer in love with her. Harry is a sensible businessman who lives his life with order and reason and is still able to embrace his more romantic sensibility wanting his life to embody the love he feels. He racks his brain to come up with the tidiest most logical solution to his dilemma and somehow the best plan he can come up with is to kill his wife. He rationalizes that this will cause the least amount of pain to all involved including his children. Is it me or is this the least rational course of action? Essentially this becomes MARRIED LIFE's main storyline and as it is ridiculous in concept it also serves to undermine the intelligence of what was otherwise a fairly engaging film. Even Sachs seems unsure of this whole direction as he throws in a couple of painfully obvious scenes about how death can take away misery rather than add to it. If Sachs isn't buying it I'm not sure how he thought anyone else would.Despite its shortcomings MARRIED LIFE does plant a few seeds of wisdom in its perfectly tended garden. The banalities of spending every day of your life with the same person are accepted by most of the characters as a perfectly normal piece of the pie. With decades past between their time and ours have we really changed all that much? There are so many things happening and left unsaid in any marriage with both partners none the wiser. Subsequently we have finetuned an uncanny ability to exist in a state of comfortable misery. We may look elsewhere for distraction but so many never walk away from what they know isn't working. Applying that same logic makes sitting through MARRIED LIFE entirely acceptable while you wonder what's playing next door.".

	schema:reviewBody "Funny but real married life doesn't tend to be this interesting..... Harry excellent Chris Cooper is a prosperous middleaged business man in 1949 east coast America who appears to have a good life and a happy marriage in that buttoned down post war suburban kind of way. He has a lovely house a grandchild and a slim attractive and intelligent wife Pat fabulous Patricia Clarkson. But Harry seeks that elusive quality real happiness in his life someone who will love him totally for himself not just for the sex and he feels that he is entitled to look for it. He plans to leave Pat. Who is she? asks his canny best friend man about town Richard Pierce Brosnan over a drinkfueled dinner in town. Because there is of course another woman lurking in the wings the delicious flawless tragically widowed and much younger Kay Rachel McAdams as a classic Hitchcock blonde. And Harry makes the serious and fundamental error of introducing them to one another. Harry is convinced that Pat is so devoted to him that divorce would devastate her to a degree from which she might never recover so he resolves instead to kill her and spare her the pain and humiliation of separation. He buys poison and experiments on the elderly family dog then plots Pat's demise calmly rationalising that it is the kindest thing to do like euthanizing a slightly dotty pet. Richard meanwhile is befriending Kay himself and becoming more and more drawn to her apparently genuine niceness. But things are not all they seem. Pat herself has some secrets which Richard stumbles upon when he arrives early to stay at Harry and Pat's weekend cottage. It seems Pat too has a lover rumpled local author John O'Brien David Wenham but Pat feels she can never leave Harry because after all he is devoted to her and would never recover etcThe story is narrated in retrospect rather than flashback by Richard who is close to them both and is party to all their secrets. How can he keep Harry and Pat together so he can sneak off with Kay? This is not so much a love triangle as an irregular pentagon. It is beautifully written by Ira Sachs and Oren Moverman from a John Bingham novel and it's skillfully acted by all concerned. The movie tries hard to stay within the conventions of 1940s Film Noir. It is perhaps too stylized but is nicely designed and is wry and darkly humorous. I'm not sure how commercially successful it will be in the USA at this time when everyone seems to want to escape into brain dead horror flicks and big budget special effects extravaganzas. I guess it will depend on how many middle aged cynical old codgers like me are prepared to get out to a theater?Rachel McAdams seems to be picking her roles carefully I really liked her here and Pierce Brosnan plays Richard so well that I am afraid he will get typecast as the consummate cad having escaped the shackles of James Bond. David Wenham seemed rather underutilized given what a big name he is in Australia but possibly playing alongside such acting greats as Clarkson and Cooper will raise his profile in the USA. It's certainly a long way from 300. And for those who thought Kay McAdams is 32 was an unlikely match for Harry Cooper is 56 there is the slight consolation that Pat Clarkson is 48 gets to play with the younger John Wenham is 42. American films these days mostly keep middle aged women in an entirely sex free zone so I would imagine Clarkson must have loved this role which allows her to be sly sexy and enigmatic. Not a bad film. I enjoyed it. My only real complaint is that the ending is a little weak a bit of a cop out in its intention to avoid melodrama. Everyone appears to live happily ever after which I find just a little doubtful. I'd have loved Pat to run off with Richard. Now that would have been fun!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ira Sachs's dark comedy 'Married Life' is an intriguing little film set in the 40s50s. Dealing with complex relations it somewhat portrays the men as selfish and the female as hungry for love...but there are layers and it's not all so black and white. What's also interesting is the unusual cast that includes Pierce Brosnan Patricia Clarkson Chris Cooper and a refreshing Rachel McAdams. Though the pairing between McAdams and Brosnan is awkward the chemistry works better between her and Cooper. Brosnan seems miscast but not to the extent that it ruins the film experience. McAdams is beautiful and pulls off her part quite well but it is Clarkson and Cooper who give the best performances. I'm also surprised that people have taken this film too seriously to the point that they missed the humour which I thought was creatively done and hilarious. The element of drama is there but how could one miss the comedy? Sach's writing is superb and the direction is solid. I liked how the events unfold and Coopers's character's attempts to get what he wants and his surprise reaction towards the unexpected results. I find the title a little misleading. Yes the film is about a 'dying' marriage and its complexities but the title is a little too vague and the film focuses on much more than marriage. The score gracefully brings the feel of the 40s. Overall Sachs has made a clever unconventional black comedy in a period piece.".

While the direction is straightforward and the bulk of the performances Clarkson Brosnan McAdams are as good as they can be in this small ensemble Cooper is the one to watch here. He will never let on unless the camera is right on his tense face that he's lying or deceitful and his outward calm hides a dark desire for ridding himself of his total suburban drudgery with his significant other. There's so much that Cooper does as he did in Breach that elevates this as just another hit into the genre spittoon.Married Life is above average if not great Hitchcock homage however without the same lift of style it's more in line with an oldschool pulp drama. It allows all of the characters to be complicit and for the guilt to be so close to the surface you expect it to boil over any moment that it doesn't is half the fun. Isn't it funny for example how little Harry seems to care at all about the dog he buries I won't say how but you can guess its significance and focuses on just the future with Kay? Maybe not but there's plenty of ironic giggles to be had with these morally bankrupt characters going back and forth behind each other's backs. The actors also make it a near mustsee chewing on the dialog like it's a sandwich from a snappy deli.At the same time however there's some minor disappointment this can't be something of an equivalent to the classics of cynical old. Maybe it's the ending which I won't reveal except to say that it's a little sunnier and a little more than a headscratcher considering common sense with sincechildhood friendships.

	schema:reviewBody "I think directorcowriter Ira Sachs' subtle 2007 homage to the oldfashioned studio melodramas of the 1940s and 50s could have used more of the Baroque feverishness of a Douglas Sirk All That Heaven Allows to make the adulterydriven plot more intriguing stylistically  perhaps a face slap here a gun confrontation there even a shouting match in a restaurant. Instead Sachs along with cowriter Oren Moverman The Messenger downplays the overripe theatrics in favor of a more Hitchcockian approach to their noirish fable about the transient rules of love and deception. The resulting film is fun to watch due to its faithful period depiction but sometimes little more than a moral exercise in punishing the subversive thoughts and actions of the seemingly staid protagonist.It's 1949 and the plot centers on Harry a middleaged and very married Manhattan executive who finds himself in love with the much younger Kay a WWII widow who enjoys the attention of a man so devoted to her. Harry decides he cannot divorce his wife Pat for fear of breaking her heart. In fact he thinks it's more charitable to murder her by poisoning her digestive powder which she takes religiously every day. Harry's best friend Richard is aware of Harry's intentions and gets caught in the middle trying to save the marriage while finding himself becoming attracted to Kay as well. Not quite the victim she would seem to be Pat has secrets of her own which leads to a roundelay of events befitting the increasingly uneasy blend of treachery and absolution. Sachs capably keeps things afloat even when the suspense factor appears overly muted.A smart quartet of actors has been cast beginning with Chris Cooper Adaptation effectively embodying the crushed soul that Harry has become. Providing the voiceover narration from his character's limited perspective Pierce Brosnan The Matador uses his naturally erudite manner to great wry effect as Richard while Patricia Clarkson Whatever Works gives added dimensions of knowingness and cunning to Pat. With her hair dyed an unflattering peroxide blonde Rachel McAdams The Notebook looks poised to play the femme fatale but her character is more ingenuous than she looks. That basically means McAdams has little bandwidth to add any complex shading to Kay. The 2008 DVD offers an informative commentary from Sachs the theatrical trailer and three alternate endings each flashforwarding the story sixteen years later to O. Henrytype resolutions. While interesting none really add that much to the ending used in the movie.".

Instead Sachs along with cowriter Oren Moverman The Messenger downplays the overripe theatrics in favor of a more Hitchcockian approach to their noirish fable about the transient rules of love and deception. The resulting film is fun to watch due to its faithful period depiction but sometimes little more than a moral exercise in punishing the subversive thoughts and actions of the seemingly staid protagonist.It's 1949 and the plot centers on Harry a middleaged and very married Manhattan executive who finds himself in love with the much younger Kay a WWII widow who enjoys the attention of a man so devoted to her. Harry decides he cannot divorce his wife Pat for fear of breaking her heart. In fact he thinks it's more charitable to murder her by poisoning her digestive powder which she takes religiously every day. Harry's best friend Richard is aware of Harry's intentions and gets caught in the middle trying to save the marriage while finding himself becoming attracted to Kay as well. Not quite the victim she would seem to be Pat has secrets of her own which leads to a roundelay of events befitting the increasingly uneasy blend of treachery and absolution. Sachs capably keeps things afloat even when the suspense factor appears overly muted.A smart quartet of actors has been cast beginning with Chris Cooper Adaptation effectively embodying the crushed soul that Harry has become. Providing the voiceover narration from his character's limited perspective Pierce Brosnan The Matador uses his naturally erudite manner to great wry effect as Richard while Patricia Clarkson Whatever Works gives added dimensions of knowingness and cunning to Pat. With her hair dyed an unflattering peroxide blonde Rachel McAdams The Notebook looks poised to play the femme fatale but her character is more ingenuous than she looks. That basically means McAdams has little bandwidth to add any complex shading to Kay. The 2008 DVD offers an informative commentary from Sachs the theatrical trailer and three alternate endings each flashforwarding the story sixteen years later to O. Henrytype resolutions. While interesting none really add that much to the ending used in the movie.";

Based on the novel 'Five Roundabouts to Heaven' by John Bingham and well adapted to the screen by Oren Moverman and director Ira Sachs MARRIED LIFE is a dissection of the hallowed state of matrimony and one that shows the creases and little holes that make so many marriages fail. it is set in the late 1940s likely with the attempt to give some 'distance' to the plot but the messages remain in comparing the tale to contemporary times.Narrated by perennial playboy bachelor Richard Langley Pierce Brosnan we are introduced to Harry Allen Chris Cooper who apparently has it all  big house great job sexdriven wife Pat Patricia Clarkson country home  but Harry has fallen in love with military widow Kay Nesbitt Rachel McAdams. Harry respects and still 'loves' Pat but finds in Kay the love he has felt missing from his marriage. He confides his desire to leave Pat to Richard who is surprised  until Richard meets the beautiful Kay. Not wanting to hurt Pat Harry decides the only solution is to murder Pat so that he can then marry Kay he researches poisons and buys a potion that he plans to place in Pat's everpresent 'digestive medicine' bottle. Harry and Kay continue their secret assignations in both Kay's home and Harry's nearby country home but things begin to muddle as Richard falls for Kay and Kay's attention shifts to Richard and the devoted Pat is hiding her secret lover Tom David RichmondPeck. As the twists and turns surface everything unwinds and the ending of the story comes as a surprise to everyone! The quartet of actors  Clarkson Cooper Brosnan and McAdams  serve the story well and the flavor of the 1940s starts with superb opening credit images and carries through with the fine decors and attention to detail that don't seem to miss a beat in recreating the period. This is a difficult film to classify  it has comedy inherent in the absurdity of portions of the plot it has drama in the core of the tale and it has mystery as the surprises keep surfacing. The overall effect will be different for every viewer depending on where in the marriage spectrum each viewer stands! Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Ira Sachs' 'Forty Shades of Blue' was a story about a young Russian migr woman and her American music impresario husband who isn't really there for herit's a movie that's rambling freshly observed carefully planted in its southern milieu and vrit in style. For his new feature Sachs was granted the opportunity to work in the Hollywood system with name actors and he chose to shift gears completely. He adapted an old genre novel his word by John Bingham who was John Le Carr's mentor in MI5 and the model for Le Carr's iconic character George Smiley. 'Married Life' is a glossy period story with ironic twists. It's set in the early Fifties. Partly a social comedy partly a 'tongueincheek thriller partly a perverse love story it weaves back and forth a bit too much among all these possibilities to leave a lasting impression. It's a glossy stylishly controlled inanity all ready for the collector's shelf.Harry Allen Chris Cooper wants to run off with a young blonde and thinks he must kill his wife to spare her the pain of divorce. That's a new kind of mercy killing a droll motive for murder. Whether it's a good pretext for a meditation on relationships and love as the director believes is another question. A greater awareness of the period might have led to the observation that divorce itself at that time a somewhat scandalous social institution was more disturbing than the mere psychological loss of a loved one.Sachs is a gay man approaching straight marriage through the filter of a penchant for Joan Crawford and Bette Davis movies much as Todd Hughes approached a Fifties interracial affair and a married man's homosexuality through the filter of Douglas Sirk melodramas in his 'Far from Heaven'which like this movie featured Patricia Clarkson as the wife. 'Married Life' is more restrained than the styleobsessed 'Far from Heaven.' But though it annoys less it does not impress as much. Both movies are feasts of campy gay cinematic style but while Haynes launched a thousand hot debates 'Married Life' makes one nod Oh yes and move on.With its world of stifling bourgeois poshlost and its bumbling trapped killer this film is reminiscent of some of the minor novels of Vladimir Nabokov. And that would be a good thing if only Sachs were Nabokov but he isn't. Sachs' protagonist Harry Allen is a solemn fool. He goes about planning his murder unaware that introducing his friend Richard Langley a pleasant but somewhat stilted Pierce Brosnan to his new girlfriend Kay Rachel McAdams a young widow is a very risky move given that she's an outandout babe and Richard is appealing available and drives a nice convertible. Anyone with an emotional IQ of 100 would see Richard has more charm than the dour Harry but Harry's level is well below average even for the disdainful 21st century conception of the American Fifties. Harry's also seriously mistaken about his wife Pat Ms. Clarkson in a dark red wig she has other quite appetizing possibilities he isn't in the least aware of.The movie advances at a measured pace with all its period accouterments tidily in place. Everyone has dyed hair and Chris Cooper's apparent proclivity for very dark suits is immaculately in evidence. An atmosphere of great restraint is created the better to stun us with the story's bombshells. But it never really does.While in 'Far from Heaven' the emotions were ramped up and operatic those of 'Married Life' cause barely a ripple. People say they love each other but we don't feel it and there's no visible chemistry between the actors. There is some limited compensation in the dry comedy of certain lines of dialog. There is stylized if wan amusement in the repetition of an idea a person like you can't build happiness on the suffering of others not with the burden of morality you carry spoken unwittingly by several characters. But that's not exactly an epigram. True there's something unique about the confection Sachs has so carefully whipped up. But while this is more coherent than Hayne's Fifties melodrama it utterly lacks its impact. According to Sachs 'Five Roundabouts to Heaven' Bingham's source novel ends with a lot of people dying. That might have been nice. Couples deciding to stay together after all? Gee this is quite the time for Family Values. 'Married Life' ends with a solemnity so completely worthy of its humorless hero one may wonder if one's earlier giggles had been intended.".

While this movie has the same bizarre criminal elements and intelligent dialogue as the above I never sensed any outright comedy.Still it's well done  definitely worth a watch. Rather than a comedy I would describe it more as a drama of errors. The subject of murder is actually handled quite seriously although its casual nature might come across as odd hence the humour?. There are no real laughs but the strangeness of the story might elicit a few snorts chortles and possibly even a harrumph. But no guffaws.The acting is excellent the script is good the style  direction is smooth  suave like the 1940s setting it depicts. Some might consider it slow but I'd say that's a plus because it gives us time to digest the complex themes that are presented such as the incompatible definitions of 'love' the value of loyalty in marriage as well as friendship and of course the morality of murder.Overall I liked this film. It's just the dag blasted ending that left me feeling cheated. I won't talk about it except to say that you should watch the alternate endings included on the DVD instead. In particular Alternate 1 is closer to the book and it gives us the thematic closure that the theatrical version omits. Alternate ending 1 also has a great piece of acting by Pierce Brosnan which if it were in the actual movie would've definitely made me bump up my rating by 1 or 2 stars.Married Life is definitely worth the 2 rental fee. It deviates from the book on several key elements such as the ending and as a result doesn't quite wrap things up convincingly.

He confesses his secret to his longtime bachelor friend Richard Pierce Brosnan and even introduces Richard to the lovely Kay. Unfortunately for Harry Richard is instantly smitten and makes up his mind that he will do whatever it takes to win Kay for himself.

He soon decides the most humane thing would be to dispose of her the oldfashioned way with the aid of a little poison. While he debates on when to make his move we learn that Pat actually has a few secrets of her own. Married Life is a very clever take on the trials and tribulations of marriage. It's a dramatic piece that shows what people do for love and the extreme lengths they go so that they can be with someone. One can never truly know what is going trough their partner's mind and people will always have secrets. The film has a very tense atmosphere and could be just as easily described as a psychological thriller. Visually the film is stunning and the recreation of the era is mesmerizing. The set design is tremendous and so are the costumes. However the film biggest strength relies undeniably in the extremely talented cast. Chris Cooper is terrific specially in the second and third act of the film. Rachel Mcadams is adorable as usual and Pierce Brosnan is very charming. Patricia Clarkson also delivered a very solid performance. Overall a beautifully crafted and highly entertaining film.7.510".

Pierce Brosnan which some of you may know from his role as James Bond in Goldeneye The World Is Not Enough Die Another Day and many more. He is spectacular in this film and i don't know how he could have topped off Matador...seems like he found it out. There are some actors I'm not really familiar with but with their performances in this film i could safely say this will lead them to way better movies and even a Oscar.

And i repeated parts of the film that were either very funny or i thought were really greatly written. Pierce Brosnan which some of you may know from his role as James Bond in Goldeneye The World Is Not Enough Die Another Day and many more. He is spectacular in this film and i don't know how he could have topped off Matador...seems like he found it out. There are some actors I'm not really familiar with but with their performances in this film i could safely say this will lead them to way better movies and even a Oscar.

I had the expectation based on the preview that it was going to be a clever dark comedy with interesting plot twists to keep me on my toes. I tell you this so that you know my perspective. I was very disappointed because although there were a few laughs here and there this movie is actually very dull. If the expectation is that you are seeing a somber period piece that boils down to a quiet meditation on a flawed marriage and that this meditation is rather superficial perhaps you will like it better than I did.Forgive me for saying this but at the QA after the screening I got the feeling that Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson saw this one as a job. They were intrigued by the material but soon found themselves doing very little on screen. Patricia Clarkson has one scene with three to four lines of interesting dialog and after that her character devolves into a stereotype. Chris Cooper gets to play a good range of emotion now and then but in the end he was forced to play a stereotype as well. I cannot help but say that all of the actors involved came to this period piece and submitted to the vision of the director only to find that he really didn't have one.This movie truly suffers for this reason. The plot is very linear with few twists or surprises. The characters are very superficial and behave inconsistently at times coming across as simple stereotypes. And the film is rarely engaging as a drama and occasionally clever as a comedy.It is a shame to see a cast this strong stand around and wonder why they are bored. But if you happen to see it and know what to expect perhaps it can be enjoyed for what it is a simple tale about a marriage that could have been a short film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Day the Earth Stood Still is a stunningly inept remake of the 1950's classic of the same name. It's one of those bigbudget films so unfathomably dull and inane you wonder how it ever got made. Whereas the original warned of the dangers of nuclear armament this modern update boldly chides us for being mean to each other and not taking care of the environment. Gee Hollywood thanks for the swell insight! This Christmas season Hollywood teaches us that people can sometimes suck but only that special kind of film can suck totally. Although the entire production is horrible from top to bottom the inert direction of Scott Derrickson and the randomly asinine script from David Scarpa bear most of the blame. The screenplay clearly went through arbitrary rewrites perhaps after being focusgrouped to death and shows not a single breath of imagination. Around every turn it wastes opportunities and insults the intelligence of the audience and gives us not one authentic character or moment to connect to. Even when it thinks it's being cool like the lame reveal that those alien spheres are actually arks trying to save animal life before the world is annihilated the script fails miserably. One sphere that is shown on the back of a pickup truck being attacked by flamethrowers in some foreign desert town inexplicably contains squid because well the shadows of squid inside a giant sphere look kinda neat that's why! At least the script teaches us one thing. Apparently all you need to do in order to survive an apocalyptic robotic alien insect attack that devours everything in sight is to hide under a bridge in Central Park!The saddest part of the film is how the director wastes his talented cast. The always wooden Keanu Reeves was perfectly chosen to play the alien Klaatu but even he seems to be disbelieving the words that are coming out of his mouth. Poor Jennifer Connelly an immensely emotive and alluring actress appears to be in physical pain or constipated for most the film obviously stunned she agreed to star in this junk. Kathy Bates and John Cleese apparently showed up only for their paychecks and sleepwalk through their lines and at one pivotal moment where Bates' Secretary of State attempts to show regret for some bad decisions made she actually appears to fall asleep in her chair. And then there's poor little Jaden Smith who appears bored to tears throughout the film and is given no direction from Derrickson except when he is asked to cry on cue in the supposed emotional climax of the picture that left me feeling sorry for all involved.However if anyone should be hung for this travesty it's the producers who must've run out of money at some point and filled the gap in funds with some nauseating product placement. How else do we explain Klaatu's trip to McDonald's for an important meeting with another of his kind? The Day the Earth Stood Still is easily the worst film of the year. At least The Happening had its accidentally humorous moments. This clunker offers no such relief. Even the special effects are done in a lazy and unimaginative manner. It's so awful I was stunned into stillness while the rest of the audience seemed to shrug their shoulders.".

	schema:reviewBody "The epic science fiction blockbuster is slowly but surely becoming a dying form of cinematic entertainment. Not since the days of cold war paranoia and the initial splurge of CGI technology back in the nineties has the genre seen much love either from its core enthusiasts or those looking for something big but different. Yet there are numerous obvious reasons for its decline in demand most of which are unavoidably apparent in this the latest and arguably first of its kind for over a year now The Day the Earth Stood Still.Based upon a movie from the genre's heyday director Scott Derrickson's version lacks the same sense of awe conviction and relevancy to our current social climate. Bombarded with underdeveloped themes an incoherent plot and extremely rough characterisation the movie suffers not just from a lack of significance in its arrival but also in its implementation. Most disappointing of all however is that in spite of the many technical flaws present the biggest let down is that the movie simply doesn't convince the effects are impressive and the story can be gripping through its thick layer of foreboding atmosphere from time to time but an overall lack of substance hurts the film's ability to truly draw you in and take off. It's a routinely enjoyable experience sure enough but an over reliance on this safeplay structure stops the feature from excelling beyond mere light entertainment.Telling a first contact story that involves rather heavy handed themes of a doomsday like prophecy like most good science fiction movies big to small The Day the Earth Stood Still retains a sense of wonder and mystique to its tale particularly early on. During these initial moments of exposition which come to an eventual climax of contact with an alien presence visiting Earth for unknown reasons the movie achieves its only real piece of coherent and engaging drama the way in which it unfolds is magnificent and capitalises on the movie's big effects budget in ways that feel impressive and yet substantially eerie at the same time there are moments when this big shot scifi movie actually feels like a genuine product of imagination and heart.Disappointingly however this does not last very long. From here on in the feature slowly but surely declines in both mystique and interest culminating in a third act which is about as convincing as it is exciting which believe it or not isn't much at all. It's around this point that things take a drastic turn from intelligent and insightful sciencefiction to big dumb blockbuster action movie the themes that are brought up during the movie's initial stages are belittled to a deux ex machina that never quite seems justified and the climax if you can call it that feels stunted and perfunctory for the sake of giving a clean feeling of catharsis. It's perhaps the biggest reason why most major productions based on scifi scripts never seem to work the balancing act between catering to the mass public and those wanting intelligent drama is a hard one to pull off and nobody here seems quite sure how to do such a thing.If there is one thing that I can praise the movie for outside of its opening act that is it would simply be within its excellent aesthetic design. From the dynamic score penned by Tyler Bates to the often endlessly interesting photography of David Tattersall The Day the Earth Stood Still gets most of its outer shell right even if everything that lies underneath is a less than inspiring mess. One also has to draw attention to lead star Keanu Reeves who plays Klaatu the alienhuman hybrid visitor and mediator who is welcomed to Earth with a less than hospitable but terribly human introduction. Reeves is an actor known for his alienlike wooden style which is why he is so often found in these kinds of films and it suits his character adequately enough here. Costar Jennifer Connelly holds her own too and while she isn't given much to work with throughout she does a fine job in playing as Keanu's contrived human sociology lesson.When the credits roll however despite the movie's impressive effects imaginative premise and somewhat entertaining moments The Day the Earth Stood Still simply feels like an empty experience. As science fiction the movie conjures up some intelligent questions and yet David Scarpa never seems quite up to the task of taking them any further and as popcorn fodder the movie simply doesn't do enough rulebreaking to come off as anything but standard fare. This awkward need to balance both crowds irrevocably results in a feature that indeed avoids polarising but only to the point where mostly everyone will leave feeling understimulated. It has its fair share of compelling and visionary moments but a distinct lack of development coherency and substance stops The Day the Earth Stood Still from being one worth remembering. Light scifi with a dash of social intrigue that mildly entertains but never reaches its potential.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

Most disappointing of all however is that in spite of the many technical flaws present the biggest let down is that the movie simply doesn't convince the effects are impressive and the story can be gripping through its thick layer of foreboding atmosphere from time to time but an overall lack of substance hurts the film's ability to truly draw you in and take off. It's a routinely enjoyable experience sure enough but an over reliance on this safeplay structure stops the feature from excelling beyond mere light entertainment.Telling a first contact story that involves rather heavy handed themes of a doomsday like prophecy like most good science fiction movies big to small The Day the Earth Stood Still retains a sense of wonder and mystique to its tale particularly early on. During these initial moments of exposition which come to an eventual climax of contact with an alien presence visiting Earth for unknown reasons the movie achieves its only real piece of coherent and engaging drama the way in which it unfolds is magnificent and capitalises on the movie's big effects budget in ways that feel impressive and yet substantially eerie at the same time there are moments when this big shot scifi movie actually feels like a genuine product of imagination and heart.Disappointingly however this does not last very long. From here on in the feature slowly but surely declines in both mystique and interest culminating in a third act which is about as convincing as it is exciting which believe it or not isn't much at all. It's around this point that things take a drastic turn from intelligent and insightful sciencefiction to big dumb blockbuster action movie the themes that are brought up during the movie's initial stages are belittled to a deux ex machina that never quite seems justified and the climax if you can call it that feels stunted and perfunctory for the sake of giving a clean feeling of catharsis. It's perhaps the biggest reason why most major productions based on scifi scripts never seem to work the balancing act between catering to the mass public and those wanting intelligent drama is a hard one to pull off and nobody here seems quite sure how to do such a thing.If there is one thing that I can praise the movie for outside of its opening act that is it would simply be within its excellent aesthetic design. From the dynamic score penned by Tyler Bates to the often endlessly interesting photography of David Tattersall The Day the Earth Stood Still gets most of its outer shell right even if everything that lies underneath is a less than inspiring mess. One also has to draw attention to lead star Keanu Reeves who plays Klaatu the alienhuman hybrid visitor and mediator who is welcomed to Earth with a less than hospitable but terribly human introduction. Reeves is an actor known for his alienlike wooden style which is why he is so often found in these kinds of films and it suits his character adequately enough here. Costar Jennifer Connelly holds her own too and while she isn't given much to work with throughout she does a fine job in playing as Keanu's contrived human sociology lesson.When the credits roll however despite the movie's impressive effects imaginative premise and somewhat entertaining moments The Day the Earth Stood Still simply feels like an empty experience. As science fiction the movie conjures up some intelligent questions and yet David Scarpa never seems quite up to the task of taking them any further and as popcorn fodder the movie simply doesn't do enough rulebreaking to come off as anything but standard fare. This awkward need to balance both crowds irrevocably results in a feature that indeed avoids polarising but only to the point where mostly everyone will leave feeling understimulated. It has its fair share of compelling and visionary moments but a distinct lack of development coherency and substance stops The Day the Earth Stood Still from being one worth remembering. Light scifi with a dash of social intrigue that mildly entertains but never reaches its potential.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net";

He is completely inexpressive and undynamic. There's no way the audience can identify with him so his fate seems ultimately unimportant. Also his purpose is largely unclear in this version. He was a messenger in the original the closest thing he can be related to in this version is a harbinger of death...Which brings me to my biggest complaint with the movie. Robert Wise's version had a clear underlying message to its audience Scott Derrickson's version doesn't. Though the big issue that the film deals with has been changed from the nuclear arms race to global warming it is hardly touched upon. The destruction of the human race is triggered with little more than a few lines of explanation.Not to undermine the efforts of the 1951 classic's film crew but The Day The Earth Stood Still is a classic because of its message a message that easily still applies today.

They assemble a team of scientists and rush them right to ground zero. Are you kidding? Never happen. 2 The UFO lands and the first people out are the scientists. Even ahead of the military. One walks right up to shake hands with the alien. Please! Never happen. 3.Klaatu is brought for interrogation. They bring him into a room with a lone interrogator and leave. Are you kidding? No guards in the room? Never happen. 4. The military decides to enclose GORT in giant steel panels. They built these in a matter of hours? How? Where? 5. After enclosing him he is lowered into some underground laboratory that appears custommade for him. Where did that come from? How did they get him there? 6. They break a diamond drill on GORT and say it will take 24 hours to fix. The boss barks Fix it now!. They send in a poor schlub who promptly screws on a new drill bit. Then the sucker dies. 7. Klaatu meets with another of his kind who has lived among us for 70 years and apparently become quite fond of us. Why didn't he convince the rest of the aliens not to destroy humanity? He came to the same conclusion that Klaatu eventually reaches. 8. The swarm is destroying everything manmade in its path. We see it destroy Giants Stadium in a matter of seconds. Then it is in Central Park. Why aren't all the buildings in Manhattan falling down? Klaatu hasn't done anything to stop them up to this point. OhI could go on and on. Then there are all of the plot clichs Good scientist resists evil government. Frustrated stepmom disconnected stepson find redemption through love of dead fatherhusband. Boo hoo hoo. Stupid general fires all his big guns at indestructible alien. You know what's going to happen. Yup general gets destroyedvaporizedeaten. Oh fugitive scientist alien and kid go to see kindly old professor. They always do that. And the authorities always show up there. This movie stinks on ice.

I guess if you're the son of a famous actor Will Smith they'll insert you in film roles even if there is no purpose to it. And Hollywood wonders why people don't go to the movies much any more and they sneer at pitiful remakes? Meanwhile Keanu Reeves was a good choice for his starring role an emotionless robotlike alien. Reeves is such a woodensounding actor to begin with that playing a bland robot is good casting for him. Klaatu is tailormade for him.Comedy was provided via the ludicrous environmental fearmongering message in here. I laughed out loud in several spots when Klaatu explained to us the reason for his mission. It's so stupid it's laughable. I was reminded of Ed Wood's horrible scifi stories in the 1950s.I will say some of the specialeffects and the surround sound in here is excellent. It was the highlight of the movie. These are good visuals and good audio and a nice film to view on BluRay. Unfortunately the story got in the way.".

The end result lacks cohesion and plays more like a sequence of 5 to 10 minutes scenes badly sewn together the prime objective of each scene being either to introduce an element taken from the original movie or on the contrary an idea absent form the1951 original instead of simply advancing the story. Second the direction poor poor poor. Third some of the worst acting I have seen in a mainstream movie for a long time I found the leads especially Keanu quite good but the other actors are decent at best with Katie Bates delivering a frighteningly catastrophic 'performance'. I was not shocked positively or negatively by all the other aspects of the film.Coming out of the theater I found myself pondering about this remake and the 1951 original. I find the Robert Wise movie quite good but not the masterpiece some claim it to be. I was therefore ready to accept a remake and the few new ideas offered by the 2008 movie made me painfully aware that a remake could indeed have been interesting had it been put in better hands or if I dare say so in much better hands. So to me it's another sadly missed opportunity.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know about the earth standing still but I certainly had a hard time moving after this one finished. I think I may have been in shock. I didn't know they still made movies as bad as this. That's me I guess the eternal optimist thinking one day Hollywood will see the error of their ways. I'm starting to think there's a greater chance of aliens landing in Manhattan though. You don't take a highly regarded classic like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and update it for no reason other than to make a few bucks. Sure you can pretend there is purpose you can cash in on the current environmental crisis fears by insinuating that aliens have come to earth to save the planet from the horrifically unappreciative human race. When you make a film with such disregard for quality though you can't do anything to convince me that you actually care about what you're trying to say.I will give Hollywood this though they have finally found the perfect vehicle for the now veteran Hollywood actor Keanu Reeves. Reeves plays Klaatu an alien in human form who has no capacity of expressing human emotion or understanding the intricacies of human nature and interaction. It might as well say that at the top of Reeves's resume so this is Reeves in his element. Honestly though this is the first time I can say that Reeves's presence in a film has absolutely nothing to do with why it is unwatchable. You know you have a problem when dialogue is so bad that it even drags Reeves's acting down. In fact having the familiar Reeves on board for this uneventful journey alongside the strikingly beautiful Jennifer Connelly at least gives us something pretty to distract us from the banality of the entire affair. Klaatu certainly rocks that threepiece suit though.The earth is supposed to stand still on this particular day because aliens have descended upon Central Park in a giant weather sphere of sorts. It is a momentous occasion one that could be the sign of the end of days. Yet in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL panic hardly seems to be in the air. Panic comes from a fear of the unknown and an inability to see a solution to your problems but David Scarpa's script is so painstakingly obvious and formulaic that you can see right through to the end at all times. I hope I'm not giving anything away here but as if this film would finish with humanity's extinction. And when the devices used to create the melodrama are so laughably contrived who knew that a white step mom and a black step son could have such hard times getting along? at least you have the special effects to revel in. Mind you when the special effects are even more ridiculous than the ensuing melodrama in a big scifi pic like this what is there to keep you sitting still let along standing?You'll never believe this but humanity or at least the American government run portion of humanity take immediate military action against the alien invaders before giving them the chance to make their case. This next bit is even more shocking. Apparently violence is not the answer to solving our problems. I swear I learned so many hard life lessons watching this movie. Perhaps the most important lesson though is that humanity will never learn. THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL represents the same disposable and commercial interests that are the root of our environmental problems. Yet here is it preaching against the very values that justify its existence. For that reason alone I would consider this film to be one of the most hopeless and hapless films of the year. We're essentially doomed so I say you can take it Klaatu. Earth is all yours. We clearly don't deserve it.".

Mind you when the special effects are even more ridiculous than the ensuing melodrama in a big scifi pic like this what is there to keep you sitting still let along standing?You'll never believe this but humanity or at least the American government run portion of humanity take immediate military action against the alien invaders before giving them the chance to make their case. This next bit is even more shocking. Apparently violence is not the answer to solving our problems. I swear I learned so many hard life lessons watching this movie. Perhaps the most important lesson though is that humanity will never learn. THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL represents the same disposable and commercial interests that are the root of our environmental problems. Yet here is it preaching against the very values that justify its existence. For that reason alone I would consider this film to be one of the most hopeless and hapless films of the year. We're essentially doomed so I say you can take it Klaatu. Earth is all yours. We clearly don't deserve it.";

It still feels dated. We are also presented with John Cleese as a Nobel Prize winner. Well that's also ridiculous on the face of it  but I tell you something if the end where nigh and you wanted someone leftfield to plead your seemingly intractable case you'd do a lot worse than Cleese. As a final oddity the product placement in the film seems at odds with the frowning upon consumerism that's at it's heart. Or maybe they're companies leading the charge to save the world.

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this movie The Day The Earth Stood Still DTESS with the feeling of wanting to compare this one to the original. I had read many of the comments about this movie and wanted to see for myself what the negative buzz was about. I was tremendously surprised at how much I liked this movie. I think a couple of things may have misled viewers because of the coming attractions of this film. It seems like folks were probably expecting the robot GORT to go around destroying cities and being a general baaaadasss character. But what DTSS turned out to be was a really good scifi movie. You have to really pay attention to the dialog to get the full jist of this tricky film. For Klaatu never really has any love or care for humanity. Their goal is to wipe mankind off the face of this planet to allow other forms of life to exist as well as future beings from other worlds. And pay close attention to what he says near the end of the film when he decides to stop humankind's extinction. He said it will cost you something. It's a tricky line but if you follow it and watch the end of the film you'll understand why the Earth stands still. I won't piece it together for everyone...see if you can figure it out. I love this movie for it's smartness. Many have complained about this being another special effects mindless mess. It is not. The visuals enhance it...but you really have to think along with the film and sit back an enjoy. Updated June 06 2009. The film's ending where Kathy Bates character looks at her watch and sees that it has stopped. Then scenes are shown of trains cars boats stopping  suggests to me that the price humanity had to pay for their world being saved was to have all electrical and mechanical devices shut off permanently. Remember that Klaatu doesn't have any real love for the human race but begins to see the possibility of their having compassion. So since it was mankind's machinery that was effecting the planet the best way to solve this situation without wiping humnity off the planet would be to neutralize all manmade things. Hence the title The day The Earth Stood Still. I might have it wrong but that's my take.".

The point was to demonstrate that the aliens did indeed have the ability to destroy the earth. In this version they choose to plug that event in at the end of the movie leaving viewers wondering why. The change in the plot from advanced races sending a being to evaluate and warn us to changes our ways to one in which the decision to destroy humanity has already been made guts the point of the original story and makes this noting more than another B aliens come to destroy the Earth movie. Finally the acting in this bomb leaves much to be desired. Keanu Reeves was emotionless as usual. Jennifer Connelly was almost as bad. Perhaps the most disappointing was Kathy Bates who is usually a great actor although I do not know that anyone could really do all that much with the flotsam of a script they were saddled with.

Why did he bring the cop back if he was on a mission to kill the entire human race?

	schema:reviewBody "So far every review I've read has been negative about this movie. To eachhisown.This movie recreates the same problem humanity being a threat to the world itself and the universe but gives a better and more mature solution to the problem than the original film.In the 1951 film the best solution that the writers could come up with was forcing humanity to behave under the threat of violence from a force greater than us. The 2008 version of this film gives a much more sophisticated answer that being the beauty of the human condition and the need for a people to face the precipice in order to embrace necessary change.Although this solution may have been better served by not being so overt it still shows the growth in our thinking. The simple fact that the first version's solution was merely a new threat of violence while the remake's solutions was to see that the beauty of our human condition makes our existence meaningful made the remake worthwhile.The role that Jaden Smith played was tremendously annoying. But I think that was the goal. He was the archetype for what mankind is an annoying untrusting and overlysimplistic childrace. Although his sudden change into maturity was anything but smooth he again represented the degree to how abruptly mankind would need to growup if we ever face similar situations.I think this movie was an amazing look into the ongoing development and maturing of mankind. It shows that even our creative side Hollywood has grown up since the original film. It shows that humanity doesn't need a greater threat of violence to make us mature we merely need to look at the beauty of our human dilemma and to draw from that strength to grow.Idealistic? Probably. But hey  that's why it's a movie.".

The simple fact that the first version's solution was merely a new threat of violence while the remake's solutions was to see that the beauty of our human condition makes our existence meaningful made the remake worthwhile.The role that Jaden Smith played was tremendously annoying. But I think that was the goal. He was the archetype for what mankind is an annoying untrusting and overlysimplistic childrace. Although his sudden change into maturity was anything but smooth he again represented the degree to how abruptly mankind would need to growup if we ever face similar situations.I think this movie was an amazing look into the ongoing development and maturing of mankind. It shows that even our creative side Hollywood has grown up since the original film. It shows that humanity doesn't need a greater threat of violence to make us mature we merely need to look at the beauty of our human dilemma and to draw from that strength to grow.Idealistic? Probably. But hey  that's why it's a movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "So I was one of those people who was screaming no at The Day The Earth Stood Still remake the original is one of my favorite movies. It's a terrific scifi film probably the best to come out of the 50's era. I highly recommend it moving onto the sigh remake. Keanu Reeves mmmm what on Earth about him scream alien? I guess since it looks like it hurts when his face expresses human emotion he's what the director needed. But what I didn't appreciate about the remake is that it completely changed the story and the moral the first movie brought to us. If we were to have a remake of this story at least it seems like in today's world it moral is more important than ever that humans are just destroying themselves with all the technology and violence that we have created. Instead I get 2 hours of Jennifer Connelly complaining to a stubborn Keanu Reeves on how much humans rock.Dr. Helen Benson a Princeton professor and other scientists are hastily assembled by the government in order to formulate a survival plan when it is feared that a large unknown object is due to impact Manhattan in approximately 78 minutes. Nothing can be done about it because a vital military satellite has been disabled. It hits Earth and out of the sphere comes a being named Klaatu emerges from the sphere while accompanied by a large robot. Klaatu a representative of a group of alien races has come to assess whether humanity can reverse the environmental damage it has inflicted on planet Earth. In the frightened confusion Klaatu is shot but survives and is taken to a government facility. While recovering from his injuries Klaatu is detained by Regina Jackson the United States Secretary of Defense and is barred from speaking to the United Nations. Klaatu manages to escape and he soon finds himself eluding the authorities throughout northern New Jersey specifically Newark and the forested Highlands with Helen and her stepson Jacob. After speaking with Professor Barnhardt about how his own species went through drastic evolution to survive its sun's demise Klaatu is convinced by Helen and Jacob that humans can change their ways and are worth saving The three go toward the sphere in Central Park to stop the machine from destroying the world.So when I really think about this movie it just makes me sad. I was going to be fair with the rating but gosh those special effects? For 2008 it seems like we got worse with CGI the ending effects were just way way way over the top. Keanu Reeves is sadly the only convincing actor in the film...? Oh my God did I just say that? Not to mention did Kathy Bates owe someone a favor? She's a terrific actress why was she in here? I also love how Jaden Smith Will Smith's son is taking his daddy's footsteps in alien movies does Will Smith come from another planet? Because it seems like that family is obsessed with aliens. I'm going to do you a favor and recommend watching the original Day the Earth Stood Still believe me it's so much better.310".

The acting wasn't perfect. The scripts sound ridiculous at times. If it's this flawed then why did I gave it 710? Keanu Reeves gave an interview indicated that Klaatu will become more 'human' he was absolutely right. Just this 'human' is a kind of human portrayed in the film.Yes i praised the quality of special effect. From the beginning those scenes were real eyecandy. In my opinion casting Reeves as Klaatu was a right decision. He has successfully portrayed something 'alien' to us. Did you thought that a boy and many character in the film should be killed? If you did then the movie have completely fulfilled its purpose to teach you what human being really is. I didn't understand this until the movie ended and let me having some time with myself. According to the film Klaatu learned that human race loves violence. And without any bias yes we are. Seeing men fighting for a ticket in the train station a higherrank left his crew died just to be safe and a representative of US government one good performance from Kathy Bates acting like she rules the world was for me reminded me how cruel people treated each others.It you pay fully attention to the dialogue you'll see that there's more that just a heavily CGed scifi.".

This remake of The Day the Earth Stood STill is a perfect sorry example of what passes for movie scififantasy in the year 2008. While the l951 original still fascinates with its powerful acting script production and that fabulous Bernard Hermann's musical score this new take features a shockingly inept cast and gradeZ special effects.We're treated to a zombielike Keanu Reeves who shows the emotion of an oyster. His face and eyes never change expression. His voice sounds like a dead man. His fellow living corpse is Jennifer Connelly who acts as if she exists in a different universe with no connection to what's happening around her. Even worse is the obnoxious surly black kid Jaden Smith oh yes son of the mighty Will Smith who is so repulsive you wish the giant robot Gort would zap him off the screen. It's as if the movie makers are so fanatically politically correct that they gave us a black child who is supposedly adopted by a white woman Jennifer Connelly. They have no rapport but then the child is so hostile one can understand why. One of the key figures in the original was the young boy played by the wonderful child actor Billy Gray. He was so genuinely sweet and likable that you really loved him. When he shows the alien the memorial graveside of countless dead military men and women and then visited the Abraham Lincoln memorial you were profoundly moved. When Jaden Smith does this in the remake a glycyrine tear dribbles down his cheek ss he glares sullenly at the zombielike Reaves. Wow what a really down hostile scene.There's no sense of impending disaster and when the day finally comes for the Earth to stand still a swarm of badly executed CGI bugs destroy Yankee Stadium and then stop. Keanu Reeves has obviously discovered that mankind isn't all evil. That's because the black kid and his mother have persuaded him that there is still good in the human race. If only there was some good among movie makers the type of goodness that would persuade them to give us some original scary movie magiclike Alien The Thing The Terminator halloween etc.".

Gort in particular is a computer generated monstrosity that looks like he's been imported straight from a Nintendo 64 game. Pretty much all of the actors don't seem to want to be there and almost all of them give abysmal performances.

Forgive me since I just wasted nearly two hours watching it I have not the patience to spend more than 10minutes warning others.Judged on it's own it's merely slow stupid and uneventful with some weak performances thrown in for good measure. Judged in comparison to the 50s classic it essentially lets you down in every possible area. To wit the original had The Cool Ship The Impressive Giant Robot The Deep Message and oh the Earth Standing Still! The remake blows every last one of those even the Earth standing still is less effectively done and seemingly without purpose which brings me to my original point. Hollywood has forgotten how to tell a good story! They've forgotten that a good story must have purpose and some believability and reason and that we need to care about somebody or something. Mark my words if the industry is to be saved they need help from someone who can read a script like this and ask intelligent questions questions like What's the purpose in the kid being so bratty? Who shot Klaatu and what triggered it? How can we believe that the US has the equipment  technology to move something like Gort and why did we develop it for the previous 50ft killer robot? Why would the Secretary of State or did she say Defense just follow orders to attack Klaatu when she knows they've exhausted everything and gotten nowhere? Why would a civilization as advanced as Klaatu's need to have a facetoface at a McDonalds? Why didn't the we see the UN convene over this world crisis? And the kicker for me Why wouldn't Helen Connely's character have called the Secretary Kathy Bates and told her this simple and vital sentence If any harm comes to Klaatu we are doomed he's the only one who can stop the swarm of destructobugs. If they could clear the highway for her to at the beginning of the movie wouldn't they do at least that to save all humanity! Let us pray for Hollywood else they haven't got a prayer!".

Why would a civilization as advanced as Klaatu's need to have a facetoface at a McDonalds? Why didn't the we see the UN convene over this world crisis? And the kicker for me Why wouldn't Helen Connely's character have called the Secretary Kathy Bates and told her this simple and vital sentence If any harm comes to Klaatu we are doomed he's the only one who can stop the swarm of destructobugs. If they could clear the highway for her to at the beginning of the movie wouldn't they do at least that to save all humanity! Let us pray for Hollywood else they haven't got a prayer!";

	schema:headline " much more than just scifi and alien invasion! sociocritical and moving";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm surprised at some of the comments to say the least. I do realise that I'm the overwhelming minority by saying this but I thought the film was absolutely brilliant.The first 30 minutes were very much science fiction. Danger from outer space we have to save the earth scientists are kidnapped to help the world etc etc... pretty good yet not fantastic scifi...Then with the birth of Klaatu the movie progresses into a somewhat socially critical film. There were some quotes which I remembered because they were so striking and I was surprised at the values that were conveyed e.g. Klaatu demands to speak to the world leaders and asks the Secretary of Defense? Do you speak for the entire human race? when she replies I speak for the President of the United States. I couldn't help but wonder throughout the movie Does America speak for the human race? I think it's a highly topical issue and subtly addressed in the movie. Another scene that I couldn't forget was the description by the alien disguised as an old Chinese The terrible thing is they sense which direction they are going but they are doing nothing or something along those lines. Also memorable was the action around the little kid. Very indepth character portrayal... the pain about his dead father and this being the reason for why he fights Klaatu until the showdown in the graveyard scene... and last but not least humanity trying to fight off the alien invaders. Klaatu says it himself when the boy asks him whether he would fight or run away and he says There is nothing you can do. Yet it was ironic to see how people think that there means of weaponry stands a chance against alien forces. Very smug indeed! I also liked the dramatical means that when the giant alien robot attacks earth he lifts up his arms in a surrendering pose. The effect this had on me was that I realised once more that the invaders are not the villains but just doing what they think is right...There are many more details worth mentioning but some specifics eluded me. All I can say is that the movie is much more than scifi. It's highly philosophical moving especially the story of the young boy and well done. If that's what you expect from movies then I'd strongly recommend this film... even if you are not into science fiction! Look deeper cause there is a lot to see here!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I think people are missing the message within this film saying it has none it's an insult to the original but they're all wrong. BOTH movies have a great message and both are true. In the original version Klaatu comes to Earth to warn humanity of its violent nature and that they need to change. It seems to me that those who have reviewed this movie and said it has no message whatsoever obviously weren't watching the movie but more so looking for reasons to hate it. First off with any remake or adaptation you shouldn't compare it to the original it'll make you hate it. Like with the Spiderman movies so many people hated those simply because it wasn't like the comics. Hello? NONE of the comic book movies are that close to the comics! In any case the reason why they changed the movie's message for this version is because of the time we're living in. Yes it's obvious we're still a very violent race but this version is expressing the message which the majority of humanity has STILL been ignoring! GLOBAL WARMING!!!! It's why in this version the aliens have a weapon which destroys humanity and any of their creations while the other races of Earth remain protected in an orb which acts like an ark. Oh well guess people are going to ignore it still until it's too late. But as the professor said in this movie humanity will change once it's at the brink of destruction.To finish off this is a great movie especially if you give it a chance. I don't suggest watching the original before seeing this movie. Reason goes the same as trying to read the Lord of the Rings books before watching the movies. They're so different you should just forget about the original and ENJOY the new one. Just because you enjoy or love one doesn't mean you have to hate the other.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie was a project close to Louis Malle's heart he was in tears when the film premiered at a film festival in 1987 and it shows in the multilayered treatment he gives the central setting this fascinating boarding school with its broad cast of characters. Because there are so many different strands and affecting moments tangential to the central plot one is not entirely prepared for the finale even if you are expecting it. French film is characteristically digressive often to a fault but here it works to splendid advantage. It also lends itself to repeat viewings.I don't think you need to have lived in occupied Europe to appreciate this wonderful film it speaks to all of us who have lived through childhood's quicklypassing parade and know its lifelong regrets. That last image of the stone wall is emblazoned in many consciousnesses as it is in mine.There are many interesting choices Malle makes in this film. For example while the central subject is the Holocaust nearly all the Germans we actually see in the film are fairly decent if nonetheless menacing types. The real villains here are almost entirely French collaborators which was done I think to call attention to collaboration during a period when the French were dealing with the Klaus Barbie trial. Barbie was a Gestapo officer who was aided in his work rooting out Resistance leaders by many French collaborators. But casting French people as the heavies also suggests the central evil of prejudice and oppression is not something exclusive to one nationality and it broadens the scope of the movie.The tender treatment Malle affords the Catholic hierarchy in the movie is unusual too when you see other more anticlerical Malle efforts like Murmur of the Heart. There is an unexpected sense of spirituality throughout this film somewhat muted but there all the same.This may well stand as the cinematic masterpiece of a man who at his best see also Atlantic City and My Dinner With Andre was to motion pictures what his countrymen Zola and Hugo were to novels An artist who filled his canvas with the verve and breadth of human life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Au Revoir Les Enfants 1987 What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving real film? Is it something more  an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride Malle cried tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France Julien Quietin played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day Jean Bonnet Raphael Fejt and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect and eventually become good friends. Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school prayers mass classes music and exercise classes and even airraids. Eventually Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'NoJewsallowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their and our surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein and in a moment of unconscious reaction Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up and the priest Father Jean is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship guilt frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place and often they can be some of the most important in our lives and 'Au Revoir Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life for better or for worse.44".

	schema:headline " Best french movie highly recommended";
	schema:reviewBody "Goodbye children is to director Louis Malle what The Pianist has been to Roman Polanski. These are movies that dealt with intimate matters related to painful childhood experiences both taking place in occupied Europe during WW2. In both cases it is palpable that they were movies that these directors had planned to make for a long time but they waited until they had achieved a considerable degree of recognition at the end of their careers so that they would feel self assured enough to carry their project out.Goodbye children evolves around two essential guidelines  the first one is the historical background of France during WW2. The second one is about childhood friendship and loss.There are quite a lot of movies that were set in France during WW2 but the matter of collaboration of the French with the Germans was still a sensitive subject in 1987. A decade before Louis Malle had made a film called Lacombe Lucien portraying a young French peasant entering the Gestapo as a way of social promotion and it caused quite a controversy. Things had quietened a bit though when Goodbye children came out and most of the people who had lived through the period as children seemed to be pleasantly reminded of childhood memories as the boarding school and its characters appears to be a very good reflection of reality.Ugly as it has been collaboration was nothing else as a survival policy. In war time and ordictatorship people rarely afford to have moral dilemmas and this is well shown in the movie as a thriving black market goes on among children at the boarding school. The character of Joseph an illiterate limping cook is the one who gets blamed when the black market scandal breaks out and loses his job. He is also the one who is going to sell out everybody by revenge. He betrays because he feels betrayed. When one has seen Lacombe Lucien it impossible not to make a link between the two characters.Goodbye children is also a very good study of the division among French people at the time. When an old Jewish man is arrested at the restaurant by the French milice political police under the Vichy regime there is as much applause as protest. What comes as a surprise is the positive role played by the church impersonated here by Father Jean who is in fact a resistant hiding Jewish children and holds provocative sermons during mass. There definitely existed such priests and it is all the more surprising to get that portrayal from a leftwing director like Louis Malle.The plot evolves around two very different young boys. One Julien comes from a typical French upperclass family he is both gifted and spoiled. The other Jean is the typical Jewish boy brilliant but secretive. Of course no one among the college boys knows that Jewish kids are hiding there under false identities. Julien is at first both irritated and intrigued by this odd rival but as they confront they gradually become implicit allies. Their bonding is well illustrated by a few scenes for example when they get lost together in the woods or when they play piano during a bomb alert.As it can be expected from twelve year old boys they only scantly express an attachment which becomes all the more real. The very fact that a film about child friendship is done by a director who is past fifty is a revealer of its very importance in a whole lifetime. Julien only realizes the price of it when Jean is arrested by the Gestapo and waves discreetly as he walks out the college door never to be seen again. The final shot of Julien's disarrayed face which appears chillingly mature for the first time is a very powerful one. But well Louis Malle was not an amateur.Goodbye children is also a major film about loss and it gets all the more effective in doing so that it ends abruptly leaving you with a feeling of irreversibility. You never quite know how long you are going to know someone how long you still will be there you are rarely quite aware when you see someone for the last time. It is only when people are gone forever that you can realize how meaningful they were to you.If you are studying French or interested in French culture this is really a movie which as a Frenchman myself I would recommend because it is both excellent accessible and representative. Unsurprisingly it received several Cesars including the one of the best film of the year Cesars are our French equivalent of Oscars.".

These are movies that dealt with intimate matters related to painful childhood experiences both taking place in occupied Europe during WW2. In both cases it is palpable that they were movies that these directors had planned to make for a long time but they waited until they had achieved a considerable degree of recognition at the end of their careers so that they would feel self assured enough to carry their project out.Goodbye children evolves around two essential guidelines  the first one is the historical background of France during WW2. The second one is about childhood friendship and loss.There are quite a lot of movies that were set in France during WW2 but the matter of collaboration of the French with the Germans was still a sensitive subject in 1987. A decade before Louis Malle had made a film called Lacombe Lucien portraying a young French peasant entering the Gestapo as a way of social promotion and it caused quite a controversy. Things had quietened a bit though when Goodbye children came out and most of the people who had lived through the period as children seemed to be pleasantly reminded of childhood memories as the boarding school and its characters appears to be a very good reflection of reality.Ugly as it has been collaboration was nothing else as a survival policy. In war time and ordictatorship people rarely afford to have moral dilemmas and this is well shown in the movie as a thriving black market goes on among children at the boarding school. The character of Joseph an illiterate limping cook is the one who gets blamed when the black market scandal breaks out and loses his job. He is also the one who is going to sell out everybody by revenge. He betrays because he feels betrayed. When one has seen Lacombe Lucien it impossible not to make a link between the two characters.Goodbye children is also a very good study of the division among French people at the time. When an old Jewish man is arrested at the restaurant by the French milice political police under the Vichy regime there is as much applause as protest. What comes as a surprise is the positive role played by the church impersonated here by Father Jean who is in fact a resistant hiding Jewish children and holds provocative sermons during mass. There definitely existed such priests and it is all the more surprising to get that portrayal from a leftwing director like Louis Malle.The plot evolves around two very different young boys. One Julien comes from a typical French upperclass family he is both gifted and spoiled. The other Jean is the typical Jewish boy brilliant but secretive. Of course no one among the college boys knows that Jewish kids are hiding there under false identities. Julien is at first both irritated and intrigued by this odd rival but as they confront they gradually become implicit allies. Their bonding is well illustrated by a few scenes for example when they get lost together in the woods or when they play piano during a bomb alert.As it can be expected from twelve year old boys they only scantly express an attachment which becomes all the more real. The very fact that a film about child friendship is done by a director who is past fifty is a revealer of its very importance in a whole lifetime. Julien only realizes the price of it when Jean is arrested by the Gestapo and waves discreetly as he walks out the college door never to be seen again. The final shot of Julien's disarrayed face which appears chillingly mature for the first time is a very powerful one. But well Louis Malle was not an amateur.Goodbye children is also a major film about loss and it gets all the more effective in doing so that it ends abruptly leaving you with a feeling of irreversibility. You never quite know how long you are going to know someone how long you still will be there you are rarely quite aware when you see someone for the last time. It is only when people are gone forever that you can realize how meaningful they were to you.If you are studying French or interested in French culture this is really a movie which as a Frenchman myself I would recommend because it is both excellent accessible and representative. Unsurprisingly it received several Cesars including the one of the best film of the year Cesars are our French equivalent of Oscars.";

	schema:reviewBody "Possible SPOILERS. After having led a roaming and chaotic life during more than ten years abroad Louis Malle came back in France and made the movie he was always to make. This one was rewarded in Venise where it won the golden Lion in 1987. au revoir les enfants tells the story of a friendship between the son of a wealthy family Julien and a Jew boy Jean Bonnet hidden under a false identity. However at first sight nothing lets see the start of a friendship between Julien and Jean. Julien feels admiration and curiosity towards this new student but we don't really know why and Jean pretends not to see him. A few events will bring them closer especially a treasure hunt in the woods... It's a touching moving and finally tragic story because the intervention of the Gestapo will lead this friendship to an end between the two boys. It's not the first time that a Louis Malle's movie takes place during the second world war. In 1974 Lacombe Lucien told the story of a young peasant who found his place in the Gestapo. If this movie had divided the French public au revoir les enfants will provoke the unanimity. Both movies are successful and strong but Lacombe Lucien is a rough fiction whereas the other one is partly autobiographical. With this movie Malle eagered to recall a memory that upset him when he was at school the arrest of a few Jew children who were hidden under a false identity. This is this memory that he filmed in the last sequence. This last one is carefully prepared and filmed in the minute details as if Malle wanted to recall exactly what he saw it and then don't think about it definitely. This is one of Malle's most beautiful movies and his last great one.".

One of the new boys happens to be Jewish but the headmaster chooses to keep such identities covert while still offering him sanctuary and an education in spite of all the risks he takes.To be fair I know little of Louis Malle previous to this film but I think he must have poured his life's soul into writing  directing Les Enfant.No detail harrowing or otherwise is spared we see so much beauty amongst the horrors of occupation  collaboration but also the blossoming relationship between the two lead boys and how initial envy  hatred of the Jew is somewhat diluted by the realities that this is no infantile school game but that life and death for the Jewish boy hangs by a thread if anyone at the school should reveal his true identity.The final moments are perhaps one of the most sad  dramatic scenes I have ever seen. These days a lot of people would be waiting for some great heroic entrance from a big movie star to sort out all the misery and leave us with a reassurance that it really wasn't all that bad back then was it.But there are no heroes at the end of this movie at least not the kind of heroes Hollywood serves up. The boys in this film are the true heroes right to the very end primarily for their spirit of humanity in the face of impossible odds.This is the hard reality of war amongst children growing up not only in the face of their own adolescence and all the problems that serves but also with the dark fingered claw of Nazism hanging menacingly like the the Scythe of the Grim Reaper.This film will move you in so many directions and will hopefully bring you back down to earth from the current Hollywood shallow circus of pap  styleovercontent.Its a difficult film to track down and the reason for this can be attributed to the first paragraph of this review.".

Get it at Amazon.This is a masterpiece of cinema a work of genius by one of the greatest directors Louis Malle. He does everything with the barest touch just the slightest emphasis without rancor or any loading of the deck. He understates and plays fair always. He has complete control of his story and of the audience. He knows what they believe and what they expect. He respects that but he doesn't cater and he is very gentle about leading us to the conclusion. He makes it beautiful although it is horrible.Gaspard Manesse as Julien and Raphael Fejto as Jean are unforgettable and a reminder that in film it's important to have a good cast. Yet I suspect Malle could have made geniuses of any number of talented young boys in their parts. This is your Catholic boys school coming of age film without lecherous priests or the brutality of children that is no more than is necessary just what is real and seen in perspective the context being the Nazi occupation of France in 1944. It is amazing how Malle manages to show the bestiality and brain dead stupidity of the Nazis by presenting them at their most gentle. If one can damn by faint praise one can destroy by contrast. Compared to what is human and natural we see the Nazis as their pretentious Reich is falling apart chasing after children obsessed with psychotic racist delusions. Through the objective eyes of the children we see the evil. Malle need only let the facts speak for themselves.I think artists working in any medium would benefit from study of this film.What it says to us is be honest be fair keep it simple but not too simple. Use not a brush stroke more than necessary and pay attention to every detail especially the small ones. But while we can learn from and appreciate it takes genius to pull it off. It can't be done by connecting the dots.I am struck by a little irony on the jacket of the video. It has an early Siskel and Ebert quote 'One of the year's best films.' That's a little embarrassing unless the year is a hundred years long.Incidentally the sublime beautiful and wondrously talented Irne Jacob made her debut here in a small part as a piano teacher.".

The movie isn't complete without this horror but the horror is made complete by the really vivid recreation of this kind of private boys schoola period movie at its best.Director Louis Malle has not only a message but a sensitive feel for the mediumfor making fluid the flow and background of the plots of his films.

Beyond just being the typical movie during class! experience I thought it was pretty amazing anyway the two children actors who play Julien and Bonnet are extremely talented and perfectly encapsulate two children of the period the story is heartfelt and visceral at the same time and the ending has a tendency to stick in ones conscience.At the very least you have that. But in the context of the 3 Films of Louis Malle box set released through Criterion it has its own aspect of interest. The first is how it combines the two themes of the previous two films comingofage and the German occupation of France into what Malle seems to be wanting to talk about all along. The most important thing is that this time it's true. You don't even need to research that you can feel it as you watch.Not that it isn't without it's stylizations of cinema but that's what makes it great. Especially amazing is the fear that runs throughout it even in smaller scenes. The two key moments involving this fear though are especially great the woods and the end. The woods are mostly childish fear illusive and imagined yet it gets the spectator's heart pounding. The end is real and thus much more disturbing and helpless. The change in maturity of the character moves from an abstract I think about death all the time to a concrete I'll remember every second of that day for the rest of my life and yet the feeling of fear through an artist's mind is still a drive to create something as strong and engaging as this work.PolarisDiB".

They carry the main burden of the story and are both excellent in a cast that is uniformly good.The rambunctious behavior of a bunch of Catholic school boys is something I can relate to personally having sung in a choir as a boy where I was surprised at the ruffians who behind the scenes were like street youths full of boyish pranks and roughhousing until summoned to walk out to the altar of the church hands clasped in front of them like little cherubs. This aspect of the French boys in the film rang true to me their behavior being very true to life.The story is compelling dealing as it does with the Nazis determined to find every Jewish lad they could aided sometimes by collaborators who for one reason or another turned in Jews to the German officers. The ending is particularly poignant and well acted.Highly recommended and stands as a reminder of the cruelties of childhood and war.".

One day he witnessed a Gestapo raid in which three Jewish students and a Jewish teacher were rounded up and deported to Auschwitz. The school's headmaster Pre Jacques was arrested for harboring them and sent to the concentration camp at Mauthausen. He died shortly after the camp was liberated by the U.S. Army having refused to leave until the last French prisoner was repatriated.Generally speaking I much prefer the earlier work of Malle. Zazie and Elevator to the Gallows are both great. People tend to like his later work including this film and My Dinner With Andre. I will give this film credit for one thing it is uncompromising and nice to see Malle opted for the French.

I think what distinguishes a film like this and so many french films highbrow or lowbrowis an ability to capture and communicate authentic experiences immediately recognizable human experiences. To my mind this film is worth any price simply because of its depiction of two boys faces watching a Charlie Chaplin news reel remake of the famous ship filled with Jewish refugees turned back as it tried to enter the US. The news reel pans the Statue of Liberty in NY's harbor then the quick jerky movements of refugees being roped off and contained. Then the two boys faces. The French boy's face is oddly blank and not quite entertained. The Jewish boy's face recognizes what he sees. Yet there is no movement the boys are the same age friends in the same school. It is a haunting irreversible moment. Why do so few of these moments exist in madeforthemarket movies?Get this one if you want to be reminded what it is not to be made for the market.".

Malle waited years before he attempted to recapture the key incidents of his youth if not indeed his life and the result is a superb film arguably far better than a younger Malle much closer in time to the events would have produced. I write as someone born and bred in England a country very much a part of the War in question but one never actually invaded so I am not really qualified to expound on the rights and wrongs of portraying the occupying Germans in a somewhat sympathetic light and the French activists as the heavies as Malle has opted to do here presumably because that is how he remembers it. The film stands or falls on the two schoolboy protagonists one representing the young Louis Malle the other the Jewish boy whom he befriended at school and watched being led off by the Gestapo in the final reel and both are magnificent. It is significantly Malle's own voice we hear at the very end affirming how strongly his life was affected by that major incident.

Unlike most people Malle felt a need to make a movie about this rather dull period of his life. There is nothing very interesting about watching boys going through their daily routines at school. There is no plot just random episodes that fail to sustain a narrative flow. There's an extended scene where the two main characters are separated from their troop while playing a game in the woods. It seems like it's building up to something dramatic but it just fizzles out. The final scene is powerful but does not warrant having to sit through the rest of this underwhelming drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "Virtuosity is by no means a great movie or a good movie. It is barely above average. That though is because of Russell Crowe's character SID 6.7 who possesses over 150 serial killer personalities. He is just supposed to be used to train police but he escapes from his virtual reality to the reality. That sounds pretty interesting and this premise could be taken into many different directions especially since he is such a complex character you could go so many different way going about to make this film. Though this movie did not take the worst direction it did not take the best one. This movie went for pure action and no real drama or meaningful message. Now that is OK but it lacked in doing this because of the The directing which was average by Brett Leonard. He made this into a very exciting TV movie which it is not. He had two very talented actors in Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe yet he was not able to generate the excitement and fast pace feeling that is needed to make a good action movie.The writing is also at fault too. The writing was not great here. It seemed to have a lot of overused themes such as the cop trying to retain the high status that he used too have and also the idiot cops getting in the way. That is also OK but the dialog made this interesting idea into a movie that was not so unfamiliar. Not much originality in here despite having such a unique character. That is always the script's fault whenever this happens. The writing and directing just made this movie so frustrating to watch.You cannot blame the acting. You could see that Denzel Washington already an established actor at that time and Russell Crowe not established really tried to push this movie forward. Yet there was little to work with which made them look really average.This movie could have been much better if it was made more into a actiondrama about the our inner battles. Considering that SID 6.7 had 150 personalities the storyline of his character could have made him have a battle within himself. Now this was done to a minor level which really annoyed me. They are many other ideas or methods that could have really made this movie something but of course this did not happen. It went for cheap effects an over used clichd storyline with a little bit of a twist. That may work for some people but not for me.I'am giving this movie a 610 rating because it had so much potential.".

Hollywood's always been a midwife for technology between the science industry and the common man and in the area of virtual reality it's given us Johhny Mnemonic and this actioner starring Denzel Washington.Basic plot is this The police have been using virtual reality as a training method to test recruits. Before they use it on real cops though they draft crooks out of prison to act as guinea pigs. This is where Washington comes in. A former cop how convenient Washington's been rotting in jail for years. So the cops ask him to volunteer to be a part of the experiment and of course he agrees  but the computer he's going to be downloaded into has other plans. The 'virtual' cops are supposed to face this tough criminal in the system you see but the computer's decided to combine all of the nasty characteristics of famous reallife killers  and then download itself into a real sentient being Russell Crowe. And of course it's up to our man Washington to save the day.So there you have it folks. It's a standard cops n robbers plot moved ahead a few centuries to take advantage of modern technology. Of course it's set in the future which here is portrayed as busy grimy a bit crimeriddled.. Hmm a lot like the present come to think of it and not very inventive. And the effects are nothing special either you'd think with virtual reality being the centerpiece you'd see some dazzling special effects. Not really. The cast is good and Crowe turns in a solid if a bit hammy but most bad guys are aren't they? performance. Washington is no better or worse than usual which means the real culprit is the script here. Do yourself a favor and wait for a twoforone night at your video store to see this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Virtual Reality gets a look following in the footsteps of The Lawnmower Man. If you saw The Matrix99 and were wondering where you glimpsed the VR scenery years earlier it may have been in this pic. Here Denzel gets to briefly run around inside a VR world chasing after virtual killer Russell Crowe known as Sid 6.7 very close to 6.66 isn't it?. Sid 6.7 is the latest computer program a conglomeration of about 200 serial killers  mass murderers and so advanced it's virtually selfaware. The bulk of the picture takes place in the real world to which Sid 6.7 manages to escape to with the help of very advanced nanotechnology. I believe this was supposed to take place slightly in the future 1999 but from our perspective it's old hat and square. Everything looks outmoded and just old except the strangely hitech VR and nanites.It's also interesting from the modern perspective to view an early role of Crowe's before he hit the AList. He doesn't have much to play with here. His character doesn't have the luxury of falling back on deep psychological reasons for his murderous ways because he's inhuman. He's simply the latest software given locomotion in the semblance of a human body. He's programmed to be the way he is  there's no choice involved on his part. There's a brief mention of his program evolving once in the real world but there's no actual evidence of that. Once in the real world it's a simplistic chase  destroy mission with Denzel the only one in the city trained to stop him. Denzel just getting on the AList a couple of years earlier is standard action hero here driven by a brutal tragedy from before the film begins. The motivations for a couple of key supporting characters are suspect the designer of Sid 6.7 for example turns out to be almost as psychotic but it's hard to believe no one noticed this before was he influenced by the software?. Fichtner as a government aide has the most thankless role as an idiotic bureaucrat. The child actress playing the daughter of Lynch's character went on to teenage bombshell roles in TV series the latest being Charmed.".

Much of the movie is in fact vaguely reminiscent of movies like Demolition Man. But maybe we can interpret the movie as looking at the dangers of letting technology get too powerful like what 2001 A Space Odyssey looked at. Obviously this isn't even remotely in the same league as that one but given that it was released in 1995 it almost seems like a prediction of how computercentric the world would become.Not a masterpiece by any stretch  both Washington and Crowe have done much better work and now they're both Oscar winners  but worth seeing if only once.".

	schema:headline " The best violent video game ever made!";
	schema:reviewBody "Virtuosity plays out a lot like any ultraviolent video game.  Denzel Washington plays the hero Parker Barnes while an overthetop Russell Crowe plays Sid 6.7 the villain.  The setting is futuristic Los Angeles.  The story is that a hostile computer program Sid 6.7 has escaped cyberspace and has assumed human form and an incarcerated cop Barnes is the only person who can stop him.  Sid 6.7 craves media attention as he is the composite of 183 serial killers including Adolf Hitler Charles Manson and the man who murdered Parker's wife and daughter.  Sid constantly uses taunts to try to get Parker to slip up and leaves a trail of dead bodies as well. The protagonist is played much like any other he's vulnerable and is determined to stop the villain.  The antagonist is like any classic villain completely overthetop and only exists to be beaten.  However Sid is not like most video game villains.  Sid is nearly invincible because he is not human but a machine.  In addition to that he can regenerate his injuries by using the silicon properties of glass.  This proves to be quite a challenge for Parker as it makes defeating Sid very difficult.  In the end this advantage is also Sid's only weakness the larger his injuries the longer time it will take to regenerate and the easier it is for him to be defeated.Now some people may view Virtuosity to be at best ultraviolent entertainment which it is not.  This film is actually a lot more than that. What Virtuosity is trying to show us is how truly fd up our society has or will become.  The best example of this is during the Death T.V. scene when Sid 6.7 holds a television studio hostage.  During this scene the camera makes numerous cuts to computer screens that are showing the television ratings.  Note that when Sid 6.7 first takes over the studio that the very low ratings suddenly skyrocket.  From this evidence one can only conclude that our society thrives on violence.  In this case Sid is not the real villain here.  All Sid is doing is giving us what we want but can never get which is violence in all its purity and unrestrained quality. So in the words of Sid 6.7You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen.".

I am not a Russell Crowe fan at all like his character SID 6.7 Crowe is so full of himself it's pathetic. First off the film is bazaar it has to take place 15 years or more into the future. Think about it what police department would spend that kind of money on a virtual reality program to train their police officers. It a fact a computer can only train officer so much while most of the training is done with real instructors and real police academy students. I watched this movie again last night and didn't know whether to classify it as a comedy or SciFi. I think the reason why I gave it a 6 star rating is because it does have some humor to it. As for paying money to see it at the theater I'm glad I didn't. I then found out it was form the same director as the one who made Lawnmower Man and that movie was more of a mistake than Virtuosity.

The plot of Virtuosity is cut out of other movies to be sure and would be again one may be reminded of 12 Monkeys with its convicted man put on a mission by his captors or even by Batman with its antihero and psychotic villain creating chaos all over the city but perhaps if only in retrospect the movies carries some solid entertainment in the nearmindless tradition of loud stupid Hollywood science fiction movies of the 90's. It's like John Woo lite.There isn't much to the plot except that a former detective Washington in prison for killing a man and a few others one of whom responsible for the death of his wife and daughter is put into a virtual reality simulation against a psychotic being Crowe who is let into the real world by an asswipe who wants to get back at his bosses or something and now the manoamano is on in the real world and another former movie reference Escape from NY finish the mission get a full pardon but don't mind the chip in your head that might kill you. The plot is cookie cutter and there is lack of motivation to some of the action until the over the top climax comes around. But within the silly context of things it does make sense. And for those who may be tired of the superfast action cutting of today's product Bourne Transformers Expendables it is a relief to be able to see what's going on.Will it be amazing for everyone? Probably not. It does have generic plotting and the very end is close to a copout. But one big factor in my enjoyment of Virtuosity on top of the decent action were the stars Washington and especially Crowe. The latter gives a performance that is surprising considering where he went to for the rest of his Hollywood career. This is an actor with a lot to prove and it's ironic considering Crowe is having more diabolical fun as a TerminatorcumJoker than he has had in most other more serious action oriented roles. Sometimes his mannerisms make the stakes a little crazier or simply the way he acts across from stoic and concerned Washington that makes it work so. Strange as it might seem it's really one of Crowe's finest performances true to the wonky nature of the character and just wicked fun. It's like Crowe's imitation of a Rutger Hauer performance which is a sight to see on its own.Certainly it's no masterpiece but Virtuosity has its charms and moments of excitement. It's likely the highpoint of Leonard's career which may not be saying much but putting together cool virtual reality sequences the opening is most thrilling and two highcaliber stars makes for some fun Saturday afternoon viewing.".

The plot is fine if fairly predictable. A serial killer program escapes the computer into a humanlooking body consisting of nanites and a former cop is sent to get him. The acting is pretty good mostly. Washington is less great than usual. Crowe hams it up like a Schumacher Batman villain. The cinematography and editing are standard. Apart from what I've already mentioned this has infrequent strong language and disturbing content. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to those merely searching for something that's reasonably entertaining. 610".

The villain in question Russell Crowe's SID 6.7 is a composite of dozens of murderers including surprise the killer of Barnes' wife and daughter. And you just know as soon as you see the young daughter of Barnes' sidekick that he'll have to save her from a diabolical plot concocted by SID which he does. Moreover the special effects are surprisingly straighttoDVDlike even by 1995 standards. And Crowe's overthetop bad guy is just too much at times though perhaps that was the point.But there are some good things to be said about VIRTUOSITY. Washington's performance is nearly the saving grace the film needs even though our star sometimes seems to be asking the same question as the audience What is he doing in a picture like this? VIRTUOSITY also has a fun catandmouse quality and despite some absurdities and aforementioned clichs the imaginative storyline sporadically catches our imagination. If nothing else it certainly marks a departure for Washington who has played the good cop countless times in his career. Director Brett Leonard keeps things moving at a reasonable pace though the film sometimes feels a bit too much like THE LAWNMOWER MAN his highly disappointing entry from three years prior.VIRTUOSITY is not a completely lost cause but it is stunningly average considering the talent involved.

While I have nothing against action films I usually like a bit of intrigue and clever plotting to help move things along. Not so in this film.The sole reason to watch is for the special effects of which there are lots as the film uses virtual reality as a basis much like its predecessor THE LAWNMOWER MAN. The best scenes are the ones where SID is maimedbadly injured and his limbs regenerate with the help of glass. These scenes are cleverly done although of course they do borrow from TERMINATOR 2 speaking of borrowing the green blood inside SID is strangely reminiscent of the greenblooded androids in FORTRESS. At the end of the film there is a brilliant bit where SID is thrown through glass ceilings and his arms and legs are all cut off. However they begin to grow back again.Denzel Washington is the star of this film somewhat surprisingly. Firstly I thought he only appeared in highclass intelligent movies but obviously not. The second surprising fact is his muscular perfect physique. Now the slim Washington is not someone I would immediately suspect of possessing a body like Arnold Schwarzenegger's so I presume that it was in fact a bodysuit that the actor was wearing. Still I can't be sure. Washington is a good actor and is fine in his role but Russell Crowe as the villain is very obnoxious intentional to the extent that he made me want to switch off. Not the intended reaction I'm sure. Crowe is another Freddy Krueger clone who continually makes stupid lame wisecracks which will appeal to moronic teenagers which I for one am not.Kelly Lynch is the expected love interest but is not given much to do appearing more like a secondrate Scully than anything else. And there we have it. While the action and special effects aren't half bad in fact they're quite enjoyable the film is a clichd mess to be watched with the brain switched firmly off.

If what you're looking for reality watch a documentary. I personally I'm not a sciFi fanhowever I found myself completely entertained by this film. Crowe's performance as the over the top arrogant ego driven Sid 6.7 was dead on. He captured Sid's deity complex to the letter. But so much so that I found him disturbingly charismatic. I actually found myself rooting for the bad guy. Washington who by the way took a giant leap into scifi with this film was great as the brooding but confident inmate Barnes. Lynch was my only true complaint about this film. Although she is a strong actress she was wasted in this role. The role needed someone who was psychologically strong Lynch despite her background her dad is Twin Peaks creator David Lynch was devoid of any true criminal intelligence I still don't understand why she was cast in the part. Many avid scifi fans will notice the writer pays homage to many classic scifi films like Bladerunner and of course Stephen King's Running Man. Sid hosts Death TV All in all a valiant effort by writer director and actors. But the female lead could have been much better. I think as far as scifi goes fans will all do what Sid says and Say Thank You.".

	onyx:emotionText "If you go into a science fiction film looking for realism then you're not someone who'll truly enjoy it's purpose. Science Fiction is purely there to present a What If scenario. If what you're looking for reality watch a documentary. I personally I'm not a sciFi fanhowever I found myself completely entertained by this film. Crowe's performance as the over the top arrogant ego driven Sid 6.7 was dead on. He captured Sid's deity complex to the letter. But so much so that I found him disturbingly charismatic. I actually found myself rooting for the bad guy. Washington who by the way took a giant leap into scifi with this film was great as the brooding but confident inmate Barnes. Lynch was my only true complaint about this film. Although she is a strong actress she was wasted in this role. The role needed someone who was psychologically strong Lynch despite her background her dad is Twin Peaks creator David Lynch was devoid of any true criminal intelligence I still don't understand why she was cast in the part. Many avid scifi fans will notice the writer pays homage to many classic scifi films like Bladerunner and of course Stephen King's Running Man. Sid hosts Death TV All in all a valiant effort by writer director and actors. But the female lead could have been much better. I think as far as scifi goes fans will all do what Sid says and Say Thank You.";

	schema:reviewBody "Virtuosity represents familiar ground for director Brett Leonard. He dealt with virtual reality in the astonishingly awful Lawnmower Man. This time the special effects are more elaborate and successful but they are not stateofart even for a 1995 movie. The plot is also ordinary how many times has a special man been sent to stop an almost unkillable murderer. However there are two twists to the formula the first one is that the killer is a virtual killer the second one is that he is played by Russell Crowe.In 1995 Russell was virtually unknown. Right now he is one of the most important actors in Hollywood next to Mel Gibson Kevin Spacey and his costar from this movie Denzel Washinton. What makes Russell an unusual choice for this role is that beside being incredibly goodlooking all that his Sid 6.7 would have needed he is also tremendously talented look at his Oscar nomination for The Insider. But it is his talent that gives Sid 6.7 life. He plays his character with a complete overthetop flamboyance which makes him even more interesting that Denzel Washington. Russell has a lot of fun in creating Sid.The other performers mediocre or bland. Denzel Washington is boring as the hero and the usually impressive Louise Fletcher is completely forgettable as L.A.'s Attorney General. A huge mistake was Kelly Linch. Her character doesn't do anything important except just to be in the way of the two main characters. She is indeed the mother of the little girl that Sid uses ultimately in trying to kill Parker Barnes played by Washington. But it could have been any little girl. Linch gets so little character development that we couldn't care less for her.Overall the movie is entertaining but only because of Russell Crowe. 710.".

D.W. has been much blamed by other reviewers for giving wooden and flat performance which is rather unjust. He delivers what's expected of him a positive hero tortured by memories and own guilt being used by the government that promises him freedom if he stops their creation.However for those that love action there is plenty of this to keep the excitement levels raised. Our brilliant villain uses the analogy of music to give an artistic touch to his heinous crimes. The two main actors give a remarkable performance of extreme mockery from Russel and black rage from Denzel. Because of the well treated source material the quality of acting and set design I think it's worth it.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

The label of mockumentary just doesn't do justice to the uniqueness of this film.  ALLEN and his amazingly talented staff created a movie that no other director could have made nor even thought of doing.  Some of the humor is rather modern like the forward references to selfgratification during the psychiatrist scenes with MIA FARROW.  But mostly it's filled with humor from another time and place which we'll never return.To me one of the wonderful aspects of this is the period music dispersed throughout with joyful admiration.  We are lucky that ALLEN has continued to use music from the early part of the 20th century.  I think no other director has so consistently had such a reverence for this wonderful music. Perhaps no other director has such a strong knowledge of it either.That WOODY ALLEN normally portrays himself as a nebbishy character in many of his own movies works so well in this movie.  A more aggressive person who becomes a chameleon would not have worked as well at all.  I am glad that MIA FARROW was still associated with him when he made this film I think no other modern actress could have pulled this off as well as she did.  She has that timeless look that is appealing but has a faroff feeling.The flavor of the periodlooking cinematography and photography is part of the genius of the implementation here.  It is so right on the money.  The flickering of projectors the outoffocus look to so man scenes shot today meld amazingly well with the contrived shots.THINK ABOUT THIS  this is years before CGI took over Hollywood...years before FORREST GUMP and countless of other knockoffs have proliferated in movies.  Gee whiz there is CGI in so many movies these days.  I watched a DVD of a recent movie recently which used special effects in the most unexpected unlikely and unnecessary parts you'd be surprised.Yes ZELIG is a masterpiece and I only feel sorry for those who cannot see the astounding piece of cinema this is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Was this the first mockumentary? I checked out IMDb and it predates Guest Reiner and co.'s This Is Spinal Tap by a year. Not only was it a fake documentary it sustained the format throughout never once breaking into an enacted scene. Allen told his story set in his favorite time period The Roaring 20's using special lenses to create the old style newsreels. Using photo stills mixing real footage with his and providing exposition via modernday historians and aged characters he gave this innovative film such an authenticity that if one didn't know any better you would swear there had been an actual Leonard Zelig.Allen plays Leonard a man so devoid of identity so eager to assimilate that he literally takes on the appearance or at least the attributes of anyone he comes in contact with. Mia Farrow plays his psychiatrist Dr. Eudora Fletcher and taken in smaller doses she actually is perfect in this role. There are a few moments when you get to see an extended dialogue between the two most notably when her brother is filming The White Room sessions at her country estate. This is the only time that Allen's shtick gets to flex as he cracks jokes about teaching a Masturbation class. Advanced. I also loved Zelig groaning about Eudora's terrible cooking under hypnosis. Eventually Dr. Fletcher is able to cure him and with his newfound personality he and Eudora fall in love.Allen also introduces the idea of Zelig's story being filmed as a movie so he inter cuts some of the news sources with scenes from the film very funny. The one thing that really stood out for me though was this revelation towards the end of the film. Woody as Leonard Zelig was smiling. A lot. It was kind of weird to see but his happiness actually imbued the film with positive emotion and charmed the pants off me not literally of course to such a degree that I will undoubtedly be repeating my viewing pleasure many more times.I'll be honest. There were moments early on that I perhaps wondered if he was going to be able to sustain my interest. I thought he might be playing this conceit a little too long. What had in the first 20 minutes been enchanting and amusing seemed to dwindle in the middle of the film. Would he really succeed at telling an engaging story in this method? Well I stuck with it and I'm glad I did. He layers so many meanings into his character's transformations and all of his historians offer different interpretations. The importance of being yourself. How Zelig's journey was America's journey during the tumultuous and wild 20's. He also has a great running gag about Moby Dick that lampoons the Great American Novel.Will Allen ever be this innovative and original again? Well it appears he's making an attempt with his newest film Melinda and Melinda in which he tells the same story twice with one tone being humorous while the other is tragic. If nothing else he at least continues to strive for an authentic voice in this littered landscape of movie franchises and ridiculously insulting comedies. Go Woody.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most sophisticated cleverest funniest exquisitely shot and edited scored and acted movies ever made Zelig is a masterpiece and astounding work even for Woody Allen whose mediocre movies are way above the regular Hollywood fares. With the modest running time less than 80 minutes this mockumentary tells the story of a human chameleon Leonard Zelig Leonard the Lizard who possessed an extraordinary ability to transform himself in anyone he met or should I say an extraordinary ability possessed him?. Leonard is a shy little meek Jewish man whose rare personality disorder consists of not having his own personality at all and successfully and effortlessly adapting any personality he came close to and fitting perfectly to any surroundings. His skin turns black when he is with the Black people with the Native Americans he became one attending the dinner with the intellectuals he speaks brilliantly with F.S. Fitzgerald when on the baseball field he is Babe Ruth. The meeting with an intelligent and compassionate psychiatrist Dr. Eudora Fletcher Mia Farrow will begin the slow and long process for Zelig of searching and finding his own personality and possibility for love and happiness. The movie provides laughs and smiles but it also makes the viewer think of more serious subjects. Are we all have a Zelig inside? Don't we all want to be liked and try to adapt to our surroundings to feel comfortable? The movie can also be viewed as the meditation on the nature of the acting ability. While watching Zelig I kept thinking of a book I read recently. One of the characters was a great actor who had the similar to Zelig's disorder  he had no personality at all until he was given a part to act on stage. That Actor made the best and most convincing and complex Shakespeare's heroes  he was a brilliant reflective Hamlet but his greatest success was tragic Othello. The actor's transformation to Othello was so real that he acted it at home with his wife whom he suspected in cheating  he played his role perfectly with the same as in the play results. He ended up in the asylum where he could not act but he was allowed to read...Dostoevsky's novel The Possessed from which he chose to adapt the personality of Nikolai Stavrogin with rather unpredictable results. When his doctor finally realized what happened he took all books with the exception of The Idiot. Finally the actor became a gentle and kind Prinz Myshkin and that was the end of book.Both the book and the movie Zelig made me think of the price the artists pay to achieve perfection in their art. Are they vampires sucking the life out of their victims only to use them as characters for their acting roles? Is that the ultimate price the artist is paying for being a great artist? Does he need lives and souls of others to be able to create? This is one of many subjects Zelig makes you think about.Allen seamlessly weds Black and white newsreel footage with his humorous but deep and fascinating tale allowing Zelig to be exactly where and when History was made. Using special lenses to give the movie the old style mixing his own footage with the real documentaries including his favorite music dances feeling perfectly forever gone era Woody recreates The Roaring 20Th with breathtaking authenticity. MIWIHSIIT  according to my new grading system a Masterpiece I wish I had seen in the theater".

	schema:reviewBody "Zelig is I think my favorite Woody Allen movie. It's strange to prefer it over Annie Hall or Manhattan or Hannah and Her Sisters and perhaps it's just my trivia loving personality that points me toward Zelig rather than one of Allen's more traditional movies.Regardless it is an incredible film. Years before computer animation Allen was able to insert himself convincingly into old movies. His ability to replicate both the look and sound of old newsreels in addition to the scratches and discolorations is remarkable but this is just window dressing for something that exists on several different levels.At one level Zelig is a simple satire a fake documentary about a madeup human chameleon celebrity of the 1920's. It's rich with typical Allen touches and lines. But at another it is a serious examination of how we adulate then try to destroy celebrities in America. At yet another it is an examination of the Jewish compulsion to assimilate into whatever society we happen to be in.But there are even more layers to this film. Allen manages to be laugh out loud farcical through most of this movie but in the way of all great screen comedians injects pathos into the film when Zelig about to be sentenced for multiple crimes committed when he was in his chameleon states disappears leaving his heartbroken fiancepsychiatrist behind.And at an even deeper level it's a rejection of the modern tendency to have to understand what things mean rather than just appreciating them. This latter bit is shown by an actor discussing his book Interpreting Zelig immediately followed by the late Susan Sonntag playing herself disputing this while the subtitle identifying her shows her as the author of Against Interpretation. Indeed any film that manages to have Dr. Bruno Bettleheim Irving Howe Saul Bellow and Sonntag playing in it commenting on the fictional Zelig is something that can appeal to many people in many ways.Undoubtedly this reflects the complex character of Zelig himself who could be so many different things to so many different people. This complexity is like it is for Zelig both a curse and its redemption. Rather than just a silly little fake documentary or a complex dissertation on art and philosophy it's both and neither.All this creates a remarkably rich cinematic experience which is genuinely unique even among Allen's several mockumentaries like The Harvey Wallanger Story Take the Money and Run and Sweet and Lowdown. See it once or a hundred times there are always details either on the screen or in the ideas presented that seem new and wonderful.If it isn't Allen's great masterpiece which in my mind it could be it's a minor masterpiece worth seeing.".

Appropriately narrated in that selfimportant newsreel voiceover that is the template of most documentaries we are taken into the life of this 'human chameleon' called Leonard Zelig. Zelig has the ability to show up and blend into whomever he is around with at any given moment and pops up in the most interesting of places.Soon he catches the interest of psychiatrist Dr. Eudora Fletcher who decides to undertake the task of 'curing' Zelig. She subjects him to a series of sessions to find out the meaning of his condition and thus further her own breakthroughs in psychology. At the same time we see comments from reallife celebrities as diverse as the day is long which pretend to explain his effect on events in general his marriages the man and the myth. Their presence lends an air of veracity and at times it's hard to believe one is watching an extremely clever mockumentary due to the footage utilized. Allen in making ZELIG well before CGI was able to painstakingly age film and process photos as to make it seem that Zelig in effect was there when things happened. Viewers at the same time will feel tempted to look for the dividing line between montage and real footage one memorable scene is a rally led by Hitler an actor playing Hitler not the real man which Zelig witnesses as a German Nazi. Dr. Eudora Fletcher follows him there and hilarity ensues as she points him out in the middle of Hitler's rousing dissertation. However there is a greater irony as this event becomes a grossly fictionalized film version. Allen is clearly toying with the viewer in saying that even when he is presenting the facts about this personage events will be glamorized and the line between fact and fiction will be blurred. Clever indeed.ZELIG falls short of being one of Woody Allen's great films for the reason it's a mockumentary it barely has his presence and that of Mia Farrow as familiar faces and is a visual attack of archive footage and old jazz tunes. At the same time one of his much shorter tales of selfexistentialism in the threat of blending in it does serve as something of an allegory that bears his indelible mark.".

With the limitations of the style that Allen has chosen for the film taken into account he does a pretty good job.";

Woody Allen is brilliant as Leonard Zelig a human chameleon who can transform to other races religions and ethnicities. Anyway Woody Allen does it subtly and brilliantly without going over the top. Woody Allen is a genius with his neurosis. In this film it's a love story before doctors getting intimate with patients had become a frowned upon today. Zelig came alive in the 1920s and 1930s. His character always seems to be looking for a place to fit in society. Woody Allen's brilliance is really about examining his life in film especially his relationships. The psychiatrist is played by Mia Farrow who was involved with Woody Allen at the time. The cast is usually New York actors like Deborah Rush. But I enjoyed seeing Susan Sontag in this documentary spoof. Zelig is perhaps one of the best spoof documentaries of all time. When it's over you just want more.".

The funny premise is polished to some astonishing level of trickery with editing and matte effects seamlessly blending real 20s with recreated 20s adding Allen and Farrow and dialog and interviews that will have you recalling and roaring with laughter for days. I had not seen it since 1983 and now in 2008 to be reminded how stunning and hilarious this creation is well I am just delighted to be back on the wavelength of this genuinely brilliant hoax documentary. Now I can see how FORREST GUMP came about given that it is a similar 'historic' premise using real footage of events and eras mixed with the lead character. But ZELIG is another perfection altogether if you know your 20s silent films the imagery the early sound newsreels and all those silly songs then ZELIG is a superlative treat. It even features Mae Questrel singing a new Betty Boop song and for that alone I cheer this almost perfect film. What a delight.

Right from the start one gets that this is a mockumentary done mostly with archival footage and interviews so it would be hard for Allen working in this form the first time to keep a straight face as a filmmaker. He has to make jokes as a character and as a writer and it would be hard not to when having a 'chameleon' like the one Leonard Zelig is in the film going from scene to scene place to place historical event to celebrity to circus act to scandalceleb and finally antiNazi hero.But there's more to the piece than I remembered first seeing the film when I was younger. It's a very smart and precise account of what a person in society becomes when he tries and succeeds to become like those around him. What happens when conforming or just getting people to 'like' you or respond well to you goes too far in a direction? We see how Zelig who first got this giftcurse to be a human chameleon after being beat up as a child there's a funny story to that by the way if you can believe it does this trick with some people not quite noticing at first then it spreads like wildfire that this guy can go along with any group he's in. He can be a fat guy a black musician a politician a man with a mustache anything. We're not shown him being a woman at any point but that option could be open as well.Zelig is also an epic in a sense and as perceptive maybe a lot more focused in its approach as Forrest Gump. Where that posited a man drifted through the highs and lows of the 50's through the 60's with Zelig we're treated to what a man goes through in the world of the press and high fashion and glitz and glamour and living high in the 1920's and 1930's. Allen loves this time period and the footage he puts together what he filmed exactly and what wasn't is hard to spot making it all the more masterful and exquisite aside from the laugh factor is infectious in its spirit. And it looks and feels so much like a documentary that it immerses the viewer into its subject matter without a moment's thought of thinking oh that looks fake. Often I was laughing at the specific photos the way people are put together and Allen's wit as Zelig that I wouldn't bother to notice its fake elements.But beneath its satire on society and what it means to fit in or not and the trappings of fame and the fun with psychology Freud and I disagreed on Penis Envy says Zelig as a Psychologist he said it only worked for women is a heart. We do feel for Zelig as well as his state of being and finding of himself with the doctor played by Mia Farrow. So when these crazy things do happen to him or around him or little visual puns are made San Simeon clips are some of the best he isn't just some running onenote gag. Allen makes him a character and even delivers one of his finest performances. He'd have to  he's everyone and no one at once. A".

Although offering many chuckles and even big laughs the idea of caging someone who is different treating him like an E.T. or Elephant Man can make viewers uncomfortable.

	schema:reviewBody "Zelig is another terrific film from Woody Allen about a chameleon who lived earlier in the century and was treated by a psychiatrist to become one whole person. Done in documentary style all the way through and narrated by Patrick Horgan it's difficult to tell sometimes who is real and who is acting. Leonard Zelig is a young man who simply by standing with someone becomes just like them  if he's with a black person he becomes black if he's near a fat person he becomes rotund and so on. He is the subject of articles as well as songs Leonard the Lizard You Have Such Reptile Eyes and You May Be Six People But I Love You to name a few and inspires a popular '20s dance The Chameleon. Dick Hyman composed the songs perfectly in the style of the '20s and one in fact is sung by the voice of Betty Boop Helen Kane.

It's the story of a man who has no identity of his own and through the dedication of one doctor develops one. It's also very funny in parts particularly one of Leonard's sessions under hypnosis when he talks about the meaning of life.A wonderful film with jawdropping editing done meticulously. Highly recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "Zelig is another terrific film from Woody Allen about a chameleon who lived earlier in the century and was treated by a psychiatrist to become one whole person. Done in documentary style all the way through and narrated by Patrick Horgan it's difficult to tell sometimes who is real and who is acting. Leonard Zelig is a young man who simply by standing with someone becomes just like them  if he's with a black person he becomes black if he's near a fat person he becomes rotund and so on. He is the subject of articles as well as songs Leonard the Lizard You Have Such Reptile Eyes and You May Be Six People But I Love You to name a few and inspires a popular '20s dance The Chameleon. Dick Hyman composed the songs perfectly in the style of the '20s and one in fact is sung by the voice of Betty Boop Helen Kane.

	schema:reviewBody "Zelig 1983Amazing concept diminishing laughsWhen this starts it's astonishing and funny and inventive. And very very well done. Starting with Susan Sontag the real Sontag is a leap of reality that seems like it'll carry the whole 79 minutes. And there are truly moments that show up throughout that are good for a gasp or a laugh the Hitler scene for one. But the concept is the key and to some extent it's been done before at least in stills. And once you get it which might take three minutes or might take ten you've got it and it depends more on acting or cleverness from then on. And for me it falters too often to really make it worthwhile Mia Farrow is really a bore throughout and even Allen is sometimes straining. I have to say the first time I saw it I didn't get as tired of it so if it's the first time you might be thrilled. And if you've seen the 1994 Forrest Gump and liked it you owe it to yourself to see Zelig for being first and in my small view better technically.Because technically this is a complete marvel. The original footage is as authentically 1920s and 30s as anything authentic an odd post modern truth and the newly composed music and dance numbers are really fabulous and funny. The team Allen has during all his films this period many of them my favorites is none other than Gordon Willis behind the camera Susan Morse editing Juliet Taylor casting and Santo Loquasto costumes. The music by Allen veteran Dick Hyman who is now more famous for his ragtime renditions is key of course and really convincing sometimes convincingly bad very period.So whatever my reservations this is in many ways a fresh unique brilliant film a small one with big brief moments.".

	schema:reviewBody "First I need to point out that I generally don't like Woody Allen movies. This is not just due to his weird offscreen antics but the fact that over the years his movies just stopped being funny. Instead introspection and artsyfartsiness have replaced genuine humor. Take the Money and Run Bananas Sleeper and Play It Again Sam were good though not great films. However starting in the late 1970s he tried too hard to say something and forgot humor. Despite this in the midst of his unfunny phase he created a gem. In my opinion this is his best film and no others come even close. However I will freely admit that this movie is not for everyone. To understand and appreciate Zelig you really need to understand and care about our history. Since I am a history teacher and LOVE history it was not hard to follow the historical references. I knew who nearly all the people were who were shown in the documentary films that were spliced into the film. But for the average viewer this could be a real sticking point. They may know who Hitler was but haven't the foggiest notion who William Randolph Hearst Marion Davies Charlie Chaplin Al Smith or any of the other people were who show up in the movie. To make matters even worse the first time I saw this movie someone I know said geeI never even knew this Leonard Zelig guy existed. In other words despite the movie's preposterous elements this dunderhead believed it was ALL true! This is an extreme case but feel that in general this movie is too smart for the average viewer and as the years pass this problem will become greater. This is a real shame because they also will not in many cases understand the context in which this movie was made. The amazing computer enhancements we come to expect today were not available in the early 80s when this film was made. Instead painstaking blue screen shots were made and superimposed flawlessly into archival film and some scenes had to be created using modern actors who doubled for the real historical figures. The amazing detail and time needed make this a great film and an important one as well.".

	schema:headline " Madonna takes herself very seriously";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie for the first time in 2009 almost twenty years after its release and this proves I am not a big Madonna fan. In fact I never particularly liked or disliked her. I thought she was cool in Desperately seeking Susan but that was the Into the Groove time when she had just started her rise.The Blonde Ambition tour was probably the top of Madonna's career and this wouldbe documentary shows her at her most unbearable. Somebody mentioned that it shines a light on her human side as if she was some sort of alien but in truth she comes across as a controlling pretentious bitch who goes out of her way to humiliate and annoy people. Hardly the best human side one can show. Even the visit to her mother's grave is disgustingly theatrical. Instead of making you feel sorry for the child of five who lost her mum it makes you feel sorry for the spoiled brat she became.Of course we all know that Madonna built her career on sex and the Catholic religion and by now I doubt anybody would be shocked by her swinging crucifix or her masturbation. However tasteful it was not... and still isn't. The part filmed on stage is disappointing because some of songs performed are just not good no matter how much sex is thrown in to spice them. The documentary part is embarrassing to watch. It was interesting for me to see that Madonna had a crush on Antonio Banderas but at the time he was married with a pretty Spanish lady who looked a lot better both of Madonna and Melanie Griffith. Warren Beatty makes the only decent comment about the whole filming but he is also brushed off and humiliated not to mention the poor Costner.I am not a Costner fan either but his comment sounded rather sarcastic to me Neat applied to the overbearing and vulgar show sounds like a sarcastic way to say It sucked but looks like Madonna did not get the joke. She definitely takes herself very seriously when she describes herself as an artist who will not change anything in her show even if she risks to get arrested for indecent exposure or any such like  very unlikely  charge.Finally when she talks to her father she is so arrogant and dismissive that I felt sorry for the poor guy. She even uses the word chatartic with the intent of confuse her father but looks like she herself had no clue as to what that word means.Madonna was an icon of the 80's and early 90's and possibly a decent singer but for sure she was never a great actress and definitely not somebody with any sense of humor.".

I thought she was cool in Desperately seeking Susan but that was the Into the Groove time when she had just started her rise.The Blonde Ambition tour was probably the top of Madonna's career and this wouldbe documentary shows her at her most unbearable. Somebody mentioned that it shines a light on her human side as if she was some sort of alien but in truth she comes across as a controlling pretentious bitch who goes out of her way to humiliate and annoy people. Hardly the best human side one can show. Even the visit to her mother's grave is disgustingly theatrical. Instead of making you feel sorry for the child of five who lost her mum it makes you feel sorry for the spoiled brat she became.Of course we all know that Madonna built her career on sex and the Catholic religion and by now I doubt anybody would be shocked by her swinging crucifix or her masturbation. However tasteful it was not... and still isn't. The part filmed on stage is disappointing because some of songs performed are just not good no matter how much sex is thrown in to spice them. The documentary part is embarrassing to watch. It was interesting for me to see that Madonna had a crush on Antonio Banderas but at the time he was married with a pretty Spanish lady who looked a lot better both of Madonna and Melanie Griffith. Warren Beatty makes the only decent comment about the whole filming but he is also brushed off and humiliated not to mention the poor Costner.I am not a Costner fan either but his comment sounded rather sarcastic to me Neat applied to the overbearing and vulgar show sounds like a sarcastic way to say It sucked but looks like Madonna did not get the joke. She definitely takes herself very seriously when she describes herself as an artist who will not change anything in her show even if she risks to get arrested for indecent exposure or any such like  very unlikely  charge.Finally when she talks to her father she is so arrogant and dismissive that I felt sorry for the poor guy. She even uses the word chatartic with the intent of confuse her father but looks like she herself had no clue as to what that word means.Madonna was an icon of the 80's and early 90's and possibly a decent singer but for sure she was never a great actress and definitely not somebody with any sense of humor.";

She also talks about her huge crush on Antonio Banderas and when he snubs her she jokingly admits that she will never work with him obviously she was kidding because she worked with him in Evita.  When she's playful and in good spirits she's fun to watch.  But in the end this is really a vanity project instead of the completely naked documentary it was supposed to be.

You see Madonna playing Mother Hen to her backup performers but you get the sense that she isn't very close to any of them. Thus even though this is supposed to be an expose of Madonna's true private life there is so little of this on screen that the audience is denied a genuine insider's view. And when Madonna deals with the business aspects of her tour the boardroom door closes on the camera and the audience. This aspect of the life of a performer so well known for her productimage management might potentially be the most fascinating part of the tour but the audience is kept outside. And compared to some of what Madonna has done on the screen this is so far below her usual standards of shock as to hardly qualify as 'daring'. It is worth a watch but beware of a stretching of the 'truth' when it comes to packaging.".

It turned out to be arguably the best concert ever certainly Madonna's best concert to date. At the same time the tour was considered blasphemous for involving the use of religious images and symbols and it was called racy because of simulated sexual acts that were performed on stage.What's noteworthy about this documentary is that it shows a behindthescenes look at not just the tour but also Madonna's life during the tour's run. On stage and backstage she's a hard and demanding diva. Yet this film enables viewers to see another side of Madonna who according to Warren Beatty doesn't want to live offcamera. You get to see Madonna surrounded by different people her entourage her family and other celebrities...but you also get to see her all by herself in some scenes. In one scene you hear someone compare Madonna to a little girl lost in a storm. One can only wonder if Madonna who although is the biggest star in the world could be the loneliest person in the world. I saw this documentary when it played in theaters back in 1991 and it was great to see it on the big screen. I especially enjoyed seeing the scenes of the actual concert. I now own this film on DVD. This documentary was definitely the perfect medium with which to immortalize the thencontroversial premotherhood Madonna at the height of her career.".

Watching this documentary I understand why none of her relationships in life last very long. And I mean more than just romantic relationships she's had a lot of broken friendships. Anyway after 7 minutes of watching it I decided to skip around to the Warren Beatty parts I was really curious about him. After his scenes I skipped towards the end. Yea I skipped around a lot in this documentary because I didn't think it was worth watching the entire hour and 59 minutes. Sure I like some of her music but her act of using her sexuality is nothing new. Also spoiled divas are nothing new in this world. In the end she's an entertainer and nothing more. I'm not impressed with her quests for spirituality either.I skipped a lot with this documentary I was really interested in her relationship with Warren Beatty. She's very disrespectful she calls him up and he's supposed to meet her but there's some misunderstanding and instead of working it out like a woman she decides to hang up on him. To Madonna people are just expendable its all just a game to her. I don't think people should take themselves seriously but its like she mistreats people and I don't like that. I get why none of her relationships last and why her marriage probably didn't last.Warren Beatty also tries to talk to Madonna and bring her to reality he's not mean either he actually seems like a very nice man he speaks in a normal voice and tries to reason with her. I can see why it took a long time for Warren Beatty to commit to a woman because with a circus trainwreck like Madonna even the nicest guy in the world would run.Warren grew up and married Annette Bening and Madonna didn't grow up at all. Not even with kids in her life. She's going to be one of those lonely old people in the end with no one by her side when she really hits her senior years.".

What..what point is there existing?. a that being said....madonna is a terrific performer. her costumes routines songs sets and raw sexual energy just blow me away.she's one of the privilegedfew in society but i can see why she got there.";

Wow how original.One scene in the documentary has all the people on her music crew climbing into her bed and they talk about all sorts of taboo stuff and she gets two of the guys to kiss each other.It's not even interesting in a carcrash kind of way where it's so shocking you can't take your eyes off it.

	schema:headline " Great Documentary Highlighting Madonna's Tour";
	schema:reviewBody "Madonna Truth or Dare 1991  out of 4Madonna's Blonde Ambition tour is followed in this documentary which gives fans a behindthescenes look at the star and the tour.Even if you're not a fan of Madonna it's pretty hard not to really enjoy this documentary on a number of levels but the biggest thing is that it really is extremely wellmade. Director Alek Keshishian has really created a rather unique and original look at an artist doing their thing while trying to hold everything together.Many people have accused this film as being fake or saying that Madonna was acting up in front of the camera. This has been happening since Bob Dylan's DON'T LOOK BACK and it has happened countless times since this film was originally released. I think what makes DON'T LOOK BACK and MADONNA TRUTH OR DARE so terrific is the fact that the two artists know how to play the camera and they both did it perfectly.There's a lot of stuff going on here and the film really did a terrific job at showing you how chaotic life on the road can be. We see the tour through Japan the United States Canada and Europe and we see as Madonna struggles at times with relationships her strength and having to face other demons. The documentary does a terrific job at showing what type of physical demand Madonna had on her night after night and the backstage access was just really fun and interesting.Madonna's relationship with Warren Beatty is on display here and we see other celebrities including Kevin Costner Al Pacino and Antonio Bandera. The film and Madonna have a lot to say about the celebrity worship and everything that comes along with it. Other great moments include a concert in Toronto where the police show up threatening to arrest the singer as well as another moment where she meets with her father after a hometown gig.MADONNA TRUTH OR DARE is also beautifully shot and I loved the director's decision to show the backstage stuff in BW and keeping the concert footage in color.".

	onyx:emotionText "Madonna Truth or Dare 1991  out of 4Madonna's Blonde Ambition tour is followed in this documentary which gives fans a behindthescenes look at the star and the tour.Even if you're not a fan of Madonna it's pretty hard not to really enjoy this documentary on a number of levels but the biggest thing is that it really is extremely wellmade. Director Alek Keshishian has really created a rather unique and original look at an artist doing their thing while trying to hold everything together.Many people have accused this film as being fake or saying that Madonna was acting up in front of the camera. This has been happening since Bob Dylan's DON'T LOOK BACK and it has happened countless times since this film was originally released. I think what makes DON'T LOOK BACK and MADONNA TRUTH OR DARE so terrific is the fact that the two artists know how to play the camera and they both did it perfectly.There's a lot of stuff going on here and the film really did a terrific job at showing you how chaotic life on the road can be. We see the tour through Japan the United States Canada and Europe and we see as Madonna struggles at times with relationships her strength and having to face other demons. The documentary does a terrific job at showing what type of physical demand Madonna had on her night after night and the backstage access was just really fun and interesting.Madonna's relationship with Warren Beatty is on display here and we see other celebrities including Kevin Costner Al Pacino and Antonio Bandera. The film and Madonna have a lot to say about the celebrity worship and everything that comes along with it. Other great moments include a concert in Toronto where the police show up threatening to arrest the singer as well as another moment where she meets with her father after a hometown gig.MADONNA TRUTH OR DARE is also beautifully shot and I loved the director's decision to show the backstage stuff in BW and keeping the concert footage in color.";

Outside North America the documentary title was changed by Miramax Films to In Bed with Madonna due to the game being relatively unknown in other countries. Documentary shows the singer at her prime. She appears to be incredibly intelligent fun a bit obnoxious and moody hard working cold bitch vulnerable and funny. Everything what it takes to make this a great documentary. The movie is filmed in black and white technique and live performances are in color I guess BW style really gives it some classy touch. The film begins the day after the final show of the Blond Ambition Tour in Nice. Madonna cleans up her hotel room she explains that she is not as emotional as the rest of her group over the end of the tour.She has already grieved and she hopes she is in the safe place when it happens. In a flashback the tour is about to kick off in Japan. Everything is a mess there are sound problems and Madonna did not realize that the tour is during the rainy season in Japan. Everything about this documentary is amazing the moments she visits mothers grave the moments with the dancers the gay kiss that was so shocking at the time the gay pride in NY that you couldn't see on TV and non the less in the documentary of at the time the most popular singer in the world. How popular this documentary is and it's cult status that surrounds him made it to another documentary Strike a pose released in 2016. Strike a Pose is a BelgianDutch documentary film which premiered in Berlinale. the film profiles the dancers who performed with Madonna on her Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990.The aftermath of the tour and what are they doing today. So I would truly recommend Truth Or Dare and then switch to Strike a Pose".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the absolute worst  greatest movie I have ever seen. If you have nothing to do or just want to laugh at the most inappropriate and random things ever rent this film. This movie makes no sense has no script completely defies all forms of logic and made my stomach hurt from laughter. If real animal T.V. shows were like the show in this movie I would only watch the Discovery Channel. Attacks by salmon on bears are much more rare  No matter how many sea lions are killed each year by sharks it never seems like enough and Does your name ever get hard in the morning? might be three of the funniest things I have ever heard. The actors basically just tried to see who could make the other actors and crew laugh more during filming. There was no script just say whatever you want. It must be nice to be Adam Sandler's buddy. You can goof around make crappy movies for your friends to laugh at and still get paid. What a life! This movie should get an Academy Award for being so horrible it becomes awesome. 10 out of 10!!!!!".

This movie makes no sense has no script completely defies all forms of logic and made my stomach hurt from laughter. If real animal T.V. shows were like the show in this movie I would only watch the Discovery Channel. Attacks by salmon on bears are much more rare  No matter how many sea lions are killed each year by sharks it never seems like enough and Does your name ever get hard in the morning? might be three of the funniest things I have ever heard.

	schema:headline " Strange Wilderness is inexplicable it is an absolutely awful film but yet it is still somewhat funny and made me smile. Don't ask me why.";
	schema:reviewBody "There is only one plot line I can extract from my experience watching Strange Wilderness. It is mildly about a wilderness animal TV show hosted by a guy named Peter Gaulke Steve Zahn. He and his demented crew Allen Covert Jonah Hill Ashley Scott Justin Long e.t.c. find out that the ratings for their 3 A.M. show have dropped drastically. They have two weeks before their show gets the boot and they have to find a way to keep it on the air. Peter's friend Milas Ernest Borgnine...Making a quick chaching suggests he knows where Bigfoot lives within the Andes wild so the team decides to track the mysterious creature as a last hope to save the show. While on the road they run into one ludicrous obstacle after another but keep going anyway. That really just about wraps it up in the plot department.Strange Wilderness is an awful film in reality. The plot is thinner than a microscopic germ the acting is either druginduced or just absolutely atrocious with no real effort I'm leaning towards druginduced. The film itself is tastelessly shot in any possible way. They were in the wilderness for 90 of the film they could have thrown in at least a few nice artsy shots of trees or something but I guess that was a nono. And don't even get me started on the continuity because there is virtually no continuity to critique. What other negative things can I say about Strange Wilderness. Oh that's right how in the world could I forget this big detail the filmmakers sure did. Strange Wilderness does not seem to have a script. Instead the actors seem to sit around after being told a basic outline of what to talk about. Then they just adlib away until the scene is over and most of that screen time they don't follow that basic outline in any way imaginable. If there was any sort of script to this movie I'm guessing Jack Daniels or Captain Morgan wrote it. Who knows maybe somebody dropped a lit joint on the screenplay and it went up in flames and everyone around was too high to do a rewrite.But Strange Wilderness was funny at times there I said it. Despite all the horrendous effort that went into making this flimsy farbelowlowbrow comedy it was the actors having high and mighty fun that made the film watchable. Justin Long for instance is at his worst here as a one dimensional stoner but he still manages to give us a few chuckles just because of how random and stupid he is acting on screen. There is one funny scene in which he has tattooed eyes on his eyelids and the team wakes him up from sleeping and he scares all of them. Although the tattoos were magically gone in the next scene I guess Justin Long must have found them in a box of cracker jacks and suggested it as a gag. Steve Zahn is a very talented actor with movies like Joy Ride Rescue Dawn and even You've Got Mail. But in Strange Wilderness he too is at his seemingly deliberate worst. As the host of a wilderness TV show his character Peter is bad as is the show where you can actually hear Steve Zahn stutter and pause as he thinks of what to say next. The halfassed adlibbing is hilarious. I've never seen a movie with as little effort as Strange Wilderness and because everyone involved doesn't try to hide that fact we can actually laugh at the film.Steve Zahn Justin Long Jonah Hill and even Ernest Borgnine were most likely all stoned in the making of this movie. This movie was probably shot for their own amusement and then somehow made its way into movie theaters. I don't know how they got that accomplished but I guess the Happy Madison crew have their ways. The movie is very bad but I would prefer it any day of the week before I ever watched dreck like Epic Movie or Meet the Spartans again. At least this movie had a few fine actors having a stoned good time. In the end I give Strange Wilderness a 1.5 out of 4 because it is an awful film. But for a one time viewing it was a little amusing in a halfassed way.".

As a cinema student for four years I love and see thousands of movies yet I'm not a snob. I liked Grandma's Boy a lot even Dude Where's my Car had its Moments. In fact as a 19 year old male I almost perfectly fit the target audience for this movie. But this movie unlike others in its genre was so awful I can't even begin to construct a thorough complaint. A day after seeing it I am still in awe of how bad it was. I was disappointed that Jonah Hill wasn't funnier because SuperBad was amazing but it wasn't his fault. I'm not sure that there were any writers for this movie my best guess is that the actors got together and smoked a lot of pot before each set and then improvised their lines poorly around a general plot line. The actors seem desperate for laughs and sometimes the jokes were just gruesome. Unless you have smoked at least a bowl of marijuana do yourself a favor and don't see this movie.

I did enjoy Justin Long as he is coming into his own as an actor. Kevin Heffernan didn't get nearly enough funny lines or the proper camera time he deserved I mean he's Farva for the love of god the man is funny. With all this being said wait for the DVD. Poor plot great actors but wrongly used their talents! Severely disappointed in this film.....I even went opening night I was so excited.....stupid film.....not even a stoner flick at best and trust me I love stoner flicks!".

There is the weakest plot ever stoner jokes that are bland and wasted due to timing and shameless comments about many different ethic groups. I liked grandma's boy superbad was awesome etc... but damn this was a waste of two hours of my life. Its been a long time since I could find nothing good to say about movie I found good in 27 dresses from seeing the week before but this was just a pathetic attempt to get the stoner youth of America to come out to the movies. And I can say that as one of these stoners I should have stayed home and watched reruns on TV. Don't WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY!";

	schema:reviewBody "I created this account on IMDb solely for the purpose of reviewing this movie as well as Dan in Real Life which were both horrible movies with outlandishly high scores. I first saw this movie after seeing a trailer online showing the scene with the shark that had Steve Zahn laughing like an idiot. I thought that was funny and I saw that it had good reviews and that it was made by Happy Madison which has never failed me before. Until now.From the trailer I concluded it was a parody about a poorly made nature show and the humor was in how badly it was made even though the announcer sounded intelligent. To my disappointment the movie was actually about a group of stoners looking for Bigfoot and that 90 of the scenes that actually involved the nature show were shown in the trailer. I figured this could still be funny regardless but I was very wrong. I soon found out that the only funny scenes were the ones in the trailer and that the jokes that were funny before were ruined by the fact that you're now used to these stoners saying stupid things and that the announcer is really not supposed to be intelligent.The rest of the jokes were just painfully juvenile. Who over the age of six honestly still finds jokes involving the word 'Dick' in this case being someone's name funny? And who could stand listening to the same joke about someone's name being Dick being told for five straight minutes? This is basically the kind of humor this movie has. I also noticed some jokes from the movie being recycled throughout it later on. Why would anyone in the right mind do that? It kills the joke and whatever humor it originally had. Not only this but some scenes were just pointless in the way that they didn't even try to put humor in it at all. The humor was just awful and the movie was a disaster.".

Please please please do not see this movie. The fact that people could laugh at such poorly planned and executed jokes is beyond me. I mean there were one or two moments when it seemed like maybe this COULD be funny see the nitrous scene in the bus but as soon as you thought Hey maybe this movie could work.. The next scene came along and stunk up the place. Boo to everyone involved in this movie. I guess they were just looking for a paycheck. But why do we have to suffer? Boo indeed...";

	schema:reviewBody "One of the reasons why I decided to watch this is because I needed a comedy to laugh at if it's not possible to laugh together with it. The DVD is already available at the shops but I don't think I'm ready to fork out a Code 1 DVD price for what's essentially a short comedic film which is based from a Saturday Night Life comedy skit. Written by the same creative team of Peter Gaulke and Fred Wolf with the latter taking on directorial duties as well Strange Wilderness delivered some genuine laughs but only if you're tolerant of being insensitive to the kind of subject the film makes fun of.Strange Wilderness is a long running wildlife programme which is now succeeded by Peter Steve Zahn the host of the show whose father had made the programme into one of the best loved prime time shows. Under Peter's leadership ratings have plummeted and needless to say even their 3am timeslot is in danger of being canceled. In a last minute desperation for survival he and his crew have to look for a new way to ensure their programme continues and dropped at their laps is the opportunity to follow up on a solid lead to the whereabouts of Bigfoot.Eseentially this movie is one big road trip that tells of the crew's journey to documentary history with the likes of soundman and cocollaborator Fred Allen Covert Cooker Jonah Hill the only female in the team Cheryl Ashley Scott and cameraman Junior Justin Long amongst others. And throughout the movie we see each and everyone of them getting into enough funny scenarios that made this film look like many pieces of skits being glued together with laughs coming courtesy of sexual innuendos you just got to hand it to the turkey sight gags slapstick and just plain buffoony. In fact I even suspect that everyone in the cast were on a high as they shot this as dialogues were laced quite incoherently with plenty of adlibbing especially Justin Long though of course if he's really acting then kudos to him for being stoned all the time.While giving no respect to wildlife the funniest moments were reserved for their voice overs of Nature and it's really quite incredible should anything like it be actually aired for television. They are intentionally full of factual errors lapse into unnecessary judgmental and slanted viewpoints but always just plain ridiculously funny. Perhaps I was in crap mode but the humor here doesn't apologize for any offence made since after all the subject matter can't fight back anyway. I know I'm shallow if I say I really couldn't get enough of the film poking fun at the physical featuresdefects repeatedly. There is no plot in the movie besides everyone being perpetually broke as they try and scrimp or come out with more harebrained ideas to fund their movie and fuel the laughs.So the bottomline is don't expect any genius from Strange Wilderness but if you're in for some lowbrow humor then this movie might just be the perfect laughing medicine for anyone wanting to chase the blues away without any medicinal assistance.".

	schema:headline " Striking '40's Prison Drama.";
	schema:reviewBody "Universal International's BRUTE FORCE is without doubt one of the finest prison pictures ever made. Outstandingly directed by Jules Dassin this brutal brooding and dark drama has never been or is ever likely to be equaled. Produced for the studio in 1947 by Mark Hellinger the stunning black  white cinematography by William Daniels together with his amazing use of light and shade perfectly highlighted the bleak grimness of being shut away on the inside where injury and death lurks from every crevice of the thick walls. Based on a story by Robert Patterson it was turned into a brilliant screenplay by Richard Brooks and composer Miklos Rozsa once again supplied one of his high octane tension filled scores.Hardened convict Joe Collins Burt Lancaster is a lifer in the maximum security prison of Westgate Penitentiary. Together with his old boss Gallagher Charles Bickford  who is also doing time as the prison's newspaper editor  he plans an elaborate escape. But tyrannical head guard Captain Munsey a brilliant Hume Cronyn suspects a breakout is afoot and will go to any lengths to prevent it. In one intensely harrowing sequence in his office he interrogates inmate Louie Miller Sam Levene about the impending escape and savagely beats him with a hosepipe as Wagner's Tannhauser plays full volume on the phonograph. But Louie endures and tells him nothing. However through another informant Munsey learns the date and time of the escape and prepares his guards accordingly to thwart the breakout. With Collins getting even with the stoolie the picture ends in a bloody and vicious battle between the guards and convicts with many deaths on each side including Collins and Munsey who have it out in a climactic and spectacular fight atop the gate tower.The acting is nothing short of superb! In only his second movie after Hellinger's The Killers the previous year Lancaster is especially good as the recalcitrant and difficult Collins You're not fit for civil life and you won't accept prison life Munsey chides him. Good too is Charles Bickford Roman Bohnen as the weak and ineffectual Warden and really excellent is Art Smith as the kindly but perpetually hammered prison doctor Yes Capt. Munsey  I'm just a very ordinary man. I get drunk on whiskey but you sir  you get drunk on power. But there's little doubt the picture belongs to Cronyn. In a powerful portrayal of the highest degree he simply chews up every bit of scenery there is as the sadistic and dictatorial Captain Munsey. Also of note is the score by the great Miklos Rozsa. Almost eclipsing his music for The Killers his brooding score here pinpoints the seediness and the ever present potential for danger and death within the prison. His sombre main theme heard in its broadest rendition under the titles is a slow dirgelike piece reflecting the despair and hopelessness of those incarcerated in a high security establishment. BRUTE FORCE is one of the composer's best noir scores.The picture only has one drawback  the various and needless flashbacks depicting the women in some of the prisoner's lives. These scenes are merely padding and quiet unnecessary. They do nothing really for the movie except break the atmospheric continuity that already had been so well achieved and established. But thankfully they don't last very long and they make up what is only a minor quibble and does not prevent BRUTE FORCE remaining one of the finest gems from Hollywood's golden past.".

	schema:headline " Brute Force is a knockout!";
	schema:reviewBody "I've read recent reviews of this film that condemn it for being outdated or not relevant. Um hello? This movie is is fiftyseven years old! As such we are treated to typical 1940s Hollywood stereotypes and acting methods not to mention references to the recently completed war. Yet even within the pitfalls of the studio system this film shines as a great example of film noir. Director Jules Dassin is brilliant with light and sets the example for the French new wave of cinema. Lighting Burt Lancaster from the side or from underneath makes him and the other actors look almost surreal.Most of the dialogue is clipped and preposterous but films from this era often suffer from this same problem. Yet Brute Force retains its original power simply by virtue of the dynamite performances the stirring score and the gritty techniques of Dassin. I had to smile during the scene where Hume Cronyn's character turns up the Wagner on his hifi so the guards outside his door won't hear the inmate he's about to beat scream. This was mimicked during David Lynch's groundbreaking TV series Twin Peaks when a character turned up his radio before he beat his wife. Of course beating people isn't funny but seeing obvious references in cinema is always a kick. I highly recommend Brute Force to anyone who appreciates the art of film great directing and fine performances.".

	onyx:emotionText "I've read recent reviews of this film that condemn it for being outdated or not relevant. Um hello? This movie is is fiftyseven years old! As such we are treated to typical 1940s Hollywood stereotypes and acting methods not to mention references to the recently completed war. Yet even within the pitfalls of the studio system this film shines as a great example of film noir. Director Jules Dassin is brilliant with light and sets the example for the French new wave of cinema. Lighting Burt Lancaster from the side or from underneath makes him and the other actors look almost surreal.Most of the dialogue is clipped and preposterous but films from this era often suffer from this same problem. Yet Brute Force retains its original power simply by virtue of the dynamite performances the stirring score and the gritty techniques of Dassin. I had to smile during the scene where Hume Cronyn's character turns up the Wagner on his hifi so the guards outside his door won't hear the inmate he's about to beat scream.

Cronyn is masterful  cast wonderfully out of character his slick soft delivery takes on a skincrawling menace. Lancaster is appropriately hard and driven but the fact that he's breaking out to be by his dying girlfriend's side seems facile. The weakest elements of this film are the flashbacks to how his cellmates got locked up. It seems obvious these scenes are contrived to introduce women into an otherwise allmale cast. It turns out none of them are really bad guys except Lancaster who appears to be some kind of gangster. We aren't given much insight into his character we know he's smart and a leader but he's clearly got a tendency toward violence. Ultimately however it's not about how they got there but who they are when they get there. It's about what pushes a man past his breaking point and what happens after that. Weaknesses aside this is a worthwhile thoughtprovoking film with excellent performances all around.".

	schema:reviewBody "Burt Lancaster in his career made two classic prison story films Brute Force and Birdman of Alcatraz. Both have their share of fans. Birdman though is much longer and it is solely about Lancaster and his long incarceration. In Brute Force Lancaster heads a good ensemble cast and it is as much about the incarcerators as well as the incarcerated.One of the things that can't be overlooked about prison films and in this case Brute Force does is that all kinds of antisocial folk go into prison. Just why are they there? Notice there seem to be no sex crime perpetrators in the population not a realistic picture by any means. Or any narcotics offenders among them either and that was changing right around the time Brute Force was made.Still director Jules Dassin gets some great performances out of his cast. From the jailer's point of view the politics of the penal system never got as good a portrayal until Robert Redford's Brubaker came along over 30 years later. I like the performances of weak and burned out warden Roman Bohnen the alcoholic doctor Art Smith and of course Hume Cronyn who got his career role out of this film.Once seen you will not forget Hume Cronyn as Captain Munsey. He is a type who unfortunately is attracted to corrections work a brutal sadist who probably tortures animals in his spare time. Now that is not an indictment of all prison guards not by any means. Still people like that do make their way into that line of work.Which raises an interesting question. Being a corrections officer is one of the toughest jobs going. You are in fact going outnumbered among a group of very antisocial people and going among them unarmed. For your own survival you have to establish a reputation for toughness and fast. Bearing the necessity for that in mind is there a point where that job will turn you into a Captain Munsey? Brute Force coming out as it did post World War II with the holocaust discovery fresh in everyone's mind is disturbing and terrifying. How easy is it to slide in brutality when you have that kind of authority over people? I think that's the question director Jules Dassin is asking of his audience.The coordinated prison break at the climax of the film still almost sixty years later still has a powerful jolt to it. With the odds very much stacked against them the men still do it even after they know they've been informed on. You won't forget it or Brute Force.".

	schema:reviewBody "This powerful drama is totally uncompromising and provides a convincing account of what life is like in a prison which is being run in a particularly brutal and autocratic manner. The consequence for the inmates is that they live in an oppressive and overcrowded environment where hard labour poor quality food and harsh treatment are the norm. Furthermore they are also subjected to a cruel system which leads to many of them being abused tortured or even killed as a result of actions taken by the officials in charge.As well as the extreme brutality that they experience the prisoners also suffer the deep level of despair which comes from the knowledge that there's absolutely nothing they can do to improve their circumstances as even the prospects for rehabilitation and parole are taken away from them. The sheer desperation of these men who can't get away from either their pasts or their current tribulations inevitably creates a need for an escape plan to be developed and Joe Collins Burt Lancaster the leader of the convicts in cell R17 is a man who has more reasons than most for wanting to get out.Joe is released from a spell in solitary at the same time as the body of one of his cellmates who was a victim of the regime's evil practices is being taken away from the prison. Joe's wheelchair bound wife is also suffering from a life threatening illness and is not prepared to go ahead with the urgent surgery she needs unless Joe is with her. He wants Gallagher Charles Bickford who is the editor of the prison newspaper to help with the organisation of a breakout but Gallagher refuses because he believes that he has a chance of being given parole in the near future.The prison Warden's methods are criticised by his superiors and he's swiftly replaced by Captain Munsey Hume Cronyn who is the sadistic Chief Guard whose lust for power has finally won him the top job. The practices that Munsey puts into operation to achieve greater discipline include the indefinite suspension of parole hearings and this leads to Gallagher changing his mind and getting on board with the attempt to escape.Dr Walters Art Smith is the ageing prison physician who drinks too much and despairs about the amount of brutality that he sees. When he openly accuses Munsey of torturing the prisoners he gets struck to the floor by his disdainful colleague in an act which highlights both Munsey's intolerance and his pleasure in inflicting pain.The escape plan is eventually put into action but because Munsey had already been tipped off by one of the inmates the element of surprise is lost and what follows turns out to be an incredibly violent full scale riot with the men on both sides suffering a huge number of injuries and fatalities and the whole endeavour proving to be an absolute failure.The characters in this story are very memorable. Joe is tough full of controlled anger and completely focused on what he wants to achieve. Munsey is vicious merciless and manipulative as he fosters and uses a network of informers and even uses psychological methods which in one case leads to an inmate's suicide. Gallagher's discretion integrity and diplomacy gain him the respect of both the guards and the convicts and Dr Walters is a humanitarian whose disenchantment with the system is profound. Lancaster and Cronyn are outstanding in their roles and the performances of the rest of the cast are also consistently good.The allegorical nature of the story is strong as it shows Munsey as a dictatorial monster who plays Wagner recordings as he tortures a helpless prisoner and some of the Nazi imagery is also quite striking. Bearing in mind the timing of the movie's release and the political leanings of its director none of this is particularly shocking. What is more surprising is how this kind of depiction of the prison's officials was sanctioned under the strict censorship constraints which were in force at the time.Brute Force isn't a story of good guys and bad guys as not all the guards are bad and clearly not all the convicts are good. Both groups are perpetrators of appalling brutality as the prisoners' punishment of stool pigeons provides a couple of the most sickeningly cruel scenes in the film. What it really illustrates most strongly is how much hopelessness the people in the institution feel how futile the self perpetuating brutality is and how inevitable it is that to quote the philosophical Dr Walters nobody escapes nobody ever really escapes.".

	schema:headline " Hume Cronym's Best Remembered Role Before Old Age";
	schema:reviewBody "Tonight Turner Classic Films were showing five films in honor of actor writer Hume Cronym whose birthday is July 18. Cronym has only been dead now for five years but he was an impressive character actor in comedy and in drama. I was lucky twenty years ago to see the Broadway production of THE PETITION a two person play Cronym played with his wife and partner Jessica Tandy and I can vouch he was a crisp and fine a performer on stage as he was in his films.Captain Muncey is one of the most detestable villains in motion pictures turning his prison into a private torture chamber with the apparent acquiescence of his guards note Ray Teal his personal guard and assistant. He has his way in the prison due to the weakness of the burned out warden Roman Bohman and the bullying of a political hack from the Governor's office Richard Gaines who is impressed by Muncey's claims of the need for discipline. But as the wise but alcoholic doctor Art Smith points out while discipline has a place the Warden has never given an order to Muncey telling him to crucify the prisoners.It's a rather pitiful prison system we see here and sad to say it remains a problem. The warden keeps bemoaning his failure to come to grips with rehabilitation and punishment but he has no real suggestions in him and he is really more upset about what he will do when he is forced out for the rest of his life. The doctor tries to give a degree of humanity to the prisoners lives interestingly enough like the alcoholic doctor played by Dudley Digges in MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY but he is aware that he has no place to work outside the prison he is in either. Muncey in fact taunts him as a surgical butcher suggesting something he did went terribly wrong. Muncey and his guards seem to fall into dominating and assaulting the prisoners at the drop of a hat. When Whit Bissell is walked into accidentally by Cronym in the lunchroom Teal starts clubbing him until even Cronym points out it was his own fault not Bissell's. Only at one late point in the film when Cronym is beating up Sam Levene in his locked office do we see some of the guards react  but none intervene.The film well directed by noir specialist Jules Dassin follows the last week of Cronym's system before it collapses. There have been increasing numbers of prisoners dying because Cronym has purposely put them into unsanitary and deadly work especially in the main drains of the prison.

However one can safely say that no prisoner deserves a set of guards controlled by an egomaniacal sadist like Cronym's Muncey.The film was shot shortly after World War II so it is notable that Muncey likes to play Wagnerian music so long established as music for Nazis in his office. In fact when he beats Sam Levene in his office he has the Wagner music playing loudly to drown Levene's screams oddly enough the music is not from the RING Cycle but from TANNHAUSER and it is the Venusburg music which was supposed to be sensual!. Still the film shows the cruel powermad Captain as an unforgettable villain. He is as aware at the end of Lancaster's plans as he can be  but he is also aware of the warning Art Smith gives him  that power mad people end up being destroyed by their power. In his last few moments as one sees in the film Captain Muncey does find out how true this comment is.".

	onyx:emotionText "Tonight Turner Classic Films were showing five films in honor of actor writer Hume Cronym whose birthday is July 18. Cronym has only been dead now for five years but he was an impressive character actor in comedy and in drama. I was lucky twenty years ago to see the Broadway production of THE PETITION a two person play Cronym played with his wife and partner Jessica Tandy and I can vouch he was a crisp and fine a performer on stage as he was in his films.Captain Muncey is one of the most detestable villains in motion pictures turning his prison into a private torture chamber with the apparent acquiescence of his guards note Ray Teal his personal guard and assistant. He has his way in the prison due to the weakness of the burned out warden Roman Bohman and the bullying of a political hack from the Governor's office Richard Gaines who is impressed by Muncey's claims of the need for discipline. But as the wise but alcoholic doctor Art Smith points out while discipline has a place the Warden has never given an order to Muncey telling him to crucify the prisoners.It's a rather pitiful prison system we see here and sad to say it remains a problem. The warden keeps bemoaning his failure to come to grips with rehabilitation and punishment but he has no real suggestions in him and he is really more upset about what he will do when he is forced out for the rest of his life. The doctor tries to give a degree of humanity to the prisoners lives interestingly enough like the alcoholic doctor played by Dudley Digges in MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY but he is aware that he has no place to work outside the prison he is in either. Muncey in fact taunts him as a surgical butcher suggesting something he did went terribly wrong. Muncey and his guards seem to fall into dominating and assaulting the prisoners at the drop of a hat. When Whit Bissell is walked into accidentally by Cronym in the lunchroom Teal starts clubbing him until even Cronym points out it was his own fault not Bissell's. Only at one late point in the film when Cronym is beating up Sam Levene in his locked office do we see some of the guards react  but none intervene.The film well directed by noir specialist Jules Dassin follows the last week of Cronym's system before it collapses. There have been increasing numbers of prisoners dying because Cronym has purposely put them into unsanitary and deadly work especially in the main drains of the prison. One prisoner Burt Lancaster has refused to crack so far he has been put in solitary due to a shiv being planted on him with the connivance of Cronym and Teal. He returns to his cell and the prisoner who was the collaborator on this is killed later on in a stunningly good scene in the prison workshop.

Did anyone else find it peculiar that each of the plotters had weird relationships with women? One is hoodwinked by a moll another goes to jail for trying to buy his wife's love with a stolen mink coat yet another takes the rap for a fatherkiller and Burt lusts after a lady in a wheelchair.I did admire the performance of Art Smith as an alcoholic prison doctor who may simultaneously have been an inmate it wasn't really clear.

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't find this to be a bad film at all but based on my previous viewings of Jules Dassin's movies I found the style of this one to be surprisingly sentimental and melodramatic. I think the extent of our identification with the character played by Burt Lanchaster was too great he's far too much of a hero for the film to be really interesting.Nonetheless there are a lot of interesting elements here. Hume Cronyn's performance is definitely a brave one and a very effective one. There's a kind of pettiness that hangs about him that makes his sadistic guard captain very chilling and at the same time convincing. For example he fancies himself an expert at torture but doesn't manage to get good information from the one suspect we see questioning nor does his treatment of the Lancaster character result in the kind of intimidation he images it will. And the way he's dressed down by Art Smith's character by the way Smith deserved much higher billing relative to his importance in the film makes him seem very vulnerable.The thing I most disliked in the movie though was the flashback sequences which made the whole affair seem corny. All of them deal with women who the men in prison have left on the outside and all of these guys are basically angelic in the flashbacks. There's one with a guy stealing supplies for his Italian girlfriend. And then there's Lancaster's which is saved for the end the most ridiculous of all because he's got a woman in a wheelchair who he's trying to save from some disease. It was like the most horrid kind of 1800s melodrama stuck into a supposedly hard edged prison movie.Jules Dassin did a good job of making the movie and all the actors played their parts very well but the thing was undone from the beginning by that script which called for undue sentiment. I didn't think it made it a truly bad film but it's a very mixed bag to me and I'm surprised it's been hailed by so many as a hard boiled film.".

Maltz suggested maybe not Lawson insisted yes the dispute was eventually closed by a declaration from V.J. Jerome that Lawson was right and Maltz was obliged to engage in selfcriticism for his Browderite errors. So here's Burt Lancaster as prisoner Joe Collins and if the assonance of that name is an accident then I am the Grand Duchess Anastasia. In a back story we learn that he's serving time for organizing bank robberies students of Stalin's biography or legend please note now he's masterminding a mass escape. The prison warden Hume Cronyn made up to look uncannily like Goebbels struts around his office in jodhpurs and a black Sam Browne belt when he gets ready to torture a prisoner for information though he strips to the waistno I'm not making this upand puts on a recording of Wagner.Then we have Charles Bickford editor of the prison newspaper and clearly cast as the voice of misguided reformism he opposes the prison break arguing that publicizing the warden's brutality will eventually win better conditions but is cruelly betrayed and comes to see the wisdom of Collinsism. Jeff Corey plays one of Lancaster's subordinates but shows his true colors in a key scene when Lancaster asks the others what position they want to take up in the actual breakout Corey answers I'll go last to cover our back which sounds plausible until you realize that the others all give the only right answer which is Wherever you want me Joe. Of course Lancaster immediately grasps that Corey is the traitor presumably because he displays the capacity for independent thought and so indeed it proves.Wait there's more. There is only one Black prisoner whose job in the joint is to sweep the floors known as Calypso I swear I'm not making it up he sings all his dialog in rhymed couplets. And there's the prison doctor the spineless petitbourgeois intellectual who sympathizes with the prisoners but is bullied into inaction by the warden he drinks and utters despairing commentary.Pervading this tale is a misogyny so deep and unquestioned that the filmmakers would probably have been astonished to have it pointed out to them. Yet all the prisoners whose stories we learn are there essentially because of the perfidy greed lust or other vices of women in their livesall except for Joe who in a scene calculated to induce whiplash smoothly exits a long black getaway car to a house with a white picket fence where dwells his sweethearta crippled girl in a wheelchair her nether parts covered by a thick plaid blanket. He swoops her up in his strong arms and carries her about dolllike while she squeals with delightshe is in other words completely desexualized and infantile the only kind of woman the script seems to be saying that a man can trust.The squareup is the ancient device whereby dubious themes or images are cleansed in the last few minutes by some clumsy explanation it was all a dream or the lurid images had a sober educational purpose or some such. But what's the squareup in a Stalinist parable? It's a noir dead end! The prison break goes off the rails the warden gets his fiery comeuppance but the prisoners don't get out the state cops retake control with great bloodshed and the prison doctor gets the last word They didn't escape. No one ever escapes. In short Hollywood endorses this bleak Sartrean view by way of trumping the rest of the movie's pitch for the wisdom of Comrade Collins.".

Burt Lancaster stars as Joe Collins a hardened con in a cruel penal system who lives for only one hope escape.  Burt's nemesis is Captain Munsey a sadistic guard played by Mr. Jessica Tandy himself Hume Cronyn.  Now the very notion that Hume Cronyn could ever pose a physical challenge to Burt Lancaster is silly so director Dasin wisely keeps them apart for most of the movie until the extremely violent conclusion.Lancaster shares a cramped cell with five other convicts including Charles Bickford and Howard Duff in his film debut.  Their cell is adorned with a calendar featuring a picture of a girl so nondescript that each of the boys can see their own longlost loves in her face and we are treated to flashbacks showing how each of these losers got where he is today. Duff's flashback is the best  while a soldier in Italy he took the rap for a murder committed by his beautiful warbride Yvonne De Carlo.  Howard Duff with an armyissue machine gun is but one example of how this movie goes above and beyond the usual prison fare.The preachy scenes involving the prison's resident conscienceI mean doctorare worth fastforwarding through unfortunately those scenes are also genre requirements and Burt tends to lapse into that sensitive Frankenstein acting that he does so well but man what a climax to this movie.  It's this life's only opportunity to see a clenchteethed Hume Cronyn firing a gattling gun into an unarmed crowd.".

Now the very notion that Hume Cronyn could ever pose a physical challenge to Burt Lancaster is silly so director Dasin wisely keeps them apart for most of the movie until the extremely violent conclusion.Lancaster shares a cramped cell with five other convicts including Charles Bickford and Howard Duff in his film debut.  Their cell is adorned with a calendar featuring a picture of a girl so nondescript that each of the boys can see their own longlost loves in her face and we are treated to flashbacks showing how each of these losers got where he is today. Duff's flashback is the best  while a soldier in Italy he took the rap for a murder committed by his beautiful warbride Yvonne De Carlo.  Howard Duff with an armyissue machine gun is but one example of how this movie goes above and beyond the usual prison fare.The preachy scenes involving the prison's resident conscienceI mean doctorare worth fastforwarding through unfortunately those scenes are also genre requirements and Burt tends to lapse into that sensitive Frankenstein acting that he does so well but man what a climax to this movie.  It's this life's only opportunity to see a clenchteethed Hume Cronyn firing a gattling gun into an unarmed crowd.";

Burt Lancaster is the leader of the attempt to break out. The other cell mates include Jeff Corey Howard Duff and Whit Bissell and John Hoyt  who was the Martian with three arms in a Twilight Zone segment as well as Decius Brutus in MGM's Julius Caesar. Charles Bickford is the prison's newspaper editor and Sam Levene is the prison reporter.On the staff side of the cast list Roman Bohnen is the weakwilled prison warden Jay C. Flippen and Roy Teal are corrections officers and Hume Cronyn is superb as the Captain of the Guards.I kept thinking how easily this could have been a film about Stalags or concentration camps in World War II Germany. Escape is hopeless. The code in 1947 would never have permitted a successful escape from prison. And Cronyn is a kind of Nazi figure. He's smooth and ingratiating when necessary but his real character is revealed during a hairraising scene in which he tries to get Sam Levene to spill the beans about the escape plans. Cronyn interrogates Levene and taunts him while Wagner is playing on the phonograph. When Levene isn't forthcoming Cronyn pulls down the shades dismisses the witnesses and begins beat the handcuffed Levene with a rubber hose.The inmates are all essentially good guys. Flashbacks fill in their back stories. They were either dumb and impulsive or committed a crime to help their marriages or to get money for a girl friend's operation. Either the writer didn't know much about inmate culture or that culture has changed a great deal in the years intervening since its release.At one point the weakling warden has an interesting if brief exchange with the placid Cronyn. Cronyn remarks You set the rules but I have to enforce them. He's right about his awkward position. He belongs to a class that the sociologist Robert Park called marginal people along with top sergeants head nurses and factory foremen  not management and not quite labor. Of course not every person occupying a marginal status needs to caress his rubber hose with such relish.There are a couple of murders a suicide and a riot. There's plenty of action. At the same time prison movies are by their nature depressing. The clothing and surroundings are so bleak and grating that no matter what happens one's spirits sink.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Brute Force 1947' was the first in an impressive run of film noir pictures by Jules Dassin prior to his trouble with the HUAC. It is perhaps the father of the prison drama. Certainly without it there couldn't have been any 'Escape from Alcatraz 1979' or 'The Shawshank Redemption 1994.' Burt Lancaster plays Joe Collins a convict bent on escaping the seeminglyinpenetrable Westgate Penitentiary. Collins quietly recruits fellow inmates while avoiding the watchful gaze of chief guard Captain Munsey Hume Cronyn a sadistic powerhungry authoritarian who is ultimately more dangerous than the prisoners in his charge. Cronyn's performance is brilliant and unusual despite an otherwise unintimidating stature he nonetheless represents a vicious force of reckless authority frightening and loathsome. While ruthlessly beating a prisoner for information Munsey drowns out the noise with a recording of the opera Tannhuser perhaps a reference to Hitler's fondness for Wagner. In comparison the prison's warden A.J. Barnes Roman Bohnen is meek and impotent a tired old man clinging to the familiar.Though undoubtedly a hard tough drama with several intense and confronting moments Dassin punctures the film with tender flashbacks to the convicts' lives before prison. One inmate recalls with fondness the one time he was swindled by a crafty dame. Another laments the lover he left behind in Italy during the War. Collins remembers the innocent wheelchairridden girl whom he loves and who is doomed to die herself while he serves his prison sentence. These occasional flashbacks not only humanise the prisoners especially when compared to the cold spiteful Capt. Munsey but also suggest the reason for their crimes and their enduring lust to break free  in true noir style of course a woman is usually the catalyst. This humanisation of the characters is ultimately heartbreaking as we come to realise that their efforts are meaningless their fates doomed. The Production Code would never have allowed a successful prison break and for once the film is better for it.".

This was only Burt Lancaster's second movie but he is already a tough powerful screen presence and his character is one of the most respected within the prison community. The casting in characterizations which would be much imitated in subsequent prison films is perfection pintsized Hume Cronyn is very effectively cast against type as the quintessential brutal prison captain of the guards Charles Bickford is the bigwig inmate who gets things done Sam Levene is his reporter sidekick. Lancaster's gang includes Howard Duff making his film debut Jeff Corey as a surprising 'rat' suave ladies' man John Hoyt and Whit Bissell as the most vulnerable and least likely inmate who falls victim to Cronyn's brute force. There's also Jay C. Flippen as an easygoing prison guard Sir Lancelot as a happygolucky jackofalltrades whose songs often sarcastically comment on the action Vince Barnett as an oldtimer who brings food and messages to the most dangerous inmates currently serving in the drainpipes and an uncredited Charles McGraw as an arms dealer. Actually one of the best roles in the film  the alcoholic philosophizing prison doctor who is the only one genuinely interested in the fate of his patients  is splendidly portrayed by an actor who was unknown to me Art Smith and his confrontations with Cronyn offer some of the film's quiet highlights.While the film itself offers relatively little new in terms of plot  a few of the prisoners are planning a breakout the sadistic and powerhungry captain is more evil than the inmates themselves an informer is punished during a staged scuffle a traitor is present within Lancaster's gang the climactic escape is a botched massacre etc  and some of the plot points rather contrived  Sam Levene being sent to the drainpipes which results in his being tortured by Cronyn  but Dassin's assured handling still makes all of these situations work superbly well. Ironically after a period directing mostly light fare this was the start of a peerless run of five noir classics  culminating in his celebrated caper film RIFIFI 1955 made while exiled in France. Curiously enough another Hollywood exile would later on basically make the British equivalent of BRUTE FORCE  i.e. Joseph Losey's exceptional THE CRIMINAL 1960  while the failed prison break in similar circumstances also brings to mind Jacques Becker's masterful swan song LE TROU 1960.Like THE KILLERS 1946 before it this was a Mark Hellinger production it features no less than four actors from that film and so would be Dassin's followup  THE NAKED CITY 1948. Miklos Rozsa's music is very good and subtly underscores the action. Unfortunately the four flashback sequences added to the film to show that the hardened criminals here are goodnatured people at heart are mostly redundant and basically only serve to provide some female interest to the story still they are brief enough not be detrimental to the film's overall uncompromising bleakness. Incidentally while screenwriter Richard Brooks was involved in this capacity with several noirs  the others being THE KILLERS itself CROSSFIRE 1947 KEY LARGO 1948 and MYSTERY STREET 1950 which I recently acquired via Warners' fourth Film Noir Collection but have yet to watch  he never revisited the genre once he graduated to the director's chair though some sources do list his Mexican Revolutionset CRISIS 1950 and the crusading newspaper story DEADLINE  U.S.A. 1952 under this flexible banner.".

It features an impressive cast of familiar faces led by Lancaster in just his second film but his is essentially a onenote performance. Cronyn makes an appropriately slimy villain. Women are featured in brief flashbacks which add little to the film. The corniest flashback features an encounter between Lancaster and a crippled Blyth. The lovely De Carlo is wasted in a cameo role. The script by future director Brooks is not very interesting and Dassin tends towards the melodramatic. On the plus side the cinematography is crisp and the score by Rozsa is pretty good.".

	schema:reviewBody "For me the power of this movie rests in its faithfulness to Margaret Rosenthal's book the Honest Courtesan which is a wellresearched look at Veronica Franco's life and the plight of Venetian women in the 16th century. Dangerous Beauty while making certain assumptions and taking some literary license was a talented translation of Rosenthal's careful research into a captivating film. Many of the witty remarks and social commentary come directly from 16th century documents. Surprisingly the most unbelievable aspect of the movie her escape from the Inquisition and support from prominent Venetian nobles is historical fact. While the details are unknown and the movie is certainly more romatically dramatic than I would imagine the actual historical event it was very true to the spirit and feel supported by the evidence we have.Venetian women and indeed most medieval women were in an unenviable position as second class citizens. Veronica Franco's struggle to find an acceptable position in society as a woman of good family but poor is representative of the moral and societal conflicts of her time. Courtesans were not respected but they were accepted as a necessary evil. Their income was even taxable! In a society where female chastity was considered sacrosanct if she were to marry and a marriage bed was no less for sale than a courtesan's women's choices were limited indeed. Franco's impassioned cry in the movie I did what was necessary to survive! is no less true were it not a verbatim report of her defense. As a penniless girl her options were limited to scullery work the nunnery or prostitution. Her distinction was that while she chose to sell her body she never chose to be dominated by her profession or those who sought her out. In publishing her book of poetry and personal letters she redefined herself as a woman first and a courtesan second. Using her wit to defend herself in the public arena she skillfully manipulated accepted literary mores of the day to show her mastery of the literary as well as political implications of her position.Her greatest detractors were courtiers such as Maffio Venier who competed with courtesans for the money bestowed by wealthy patrons. As she says in the movie they must both sing for their suppers. The problem is that while she is willing to accept they are equal in their need of patronage he is unwilling to be outdone by a woman. His misogynistic works of poetry were directed toward Franco and other courtesans with the intent of parading his own virtue by damning theirs. The greatest irony is that Maffio was ultimately killed by a sexual disease while Franco died of causes unrelated to her sexual practices.While there are those who might see this movie as an acceptance of prostitution I believe they are missing the true story behind the sexual facade which they are focusing on. Franco's life was one of courage and honesty. She made choices that we may not understand but we do not live in her world. And she accepted both the privilege and the degradation that her position brought her. This movie is a powerful tribute to one who sought more in life than mere existence and who faced her trials with the courage of her convictions whether or not we or others share those convictions is immaterial.".

Franco's life was one of courage and honesty. She made choices that we may not understand but we do not live in her world. And she accepted both the privilege and the degradation that her position brought her. This movie is a powerful tribute to one who sought more in life than mere existence and who faced her trials with the courage of her convictions whether or not we or others share those convictions is immaterial.";

And it is at such moments that we discover that life like politics can be a sordid unpleasant affair or at the other end of the spectrum the greatest gift of all.It's 16th Century Venice Marco Venier Rufus Sewell is of a wealthy and powerful family and is a Senator in good standing in the community.  He is also in love with Veronica Franco Catherine McCormack who though intelligent and beautiful is beneath Marco's station in society and they are therefore forbidden to marry.  Instead Marco's father Pietro Jeroen Krabbe has arranged a marriage for his son an alliance that will be to the substantial benefit of both families.  Veronica's family meanwhile due to prevailing circumstances must look to Veronica for support so her mother Paola Jacqueline Bisset not only arranges for Veronica to become a courtesan but instructs her herself in the fine art of seduction and the kind of pleasures that will put the most coins in the coffers as well as how to survive by being in love with love.'  For Veronica it soon becomes a lucrative if not fulfilling enterprise but there are clouds forming on the horizon the least of which involves an impending war with the Turks a war they cannot win without the help of King Henry Jake Weber of France.  Very quickly life in Venice changes Marco is off to war and the formerly open acceptance of the courtesans undergoes a swift and drastic reversal of perspective among a seeming majority of those within the city.  And once again Veronica's life is in flux and she is about to find out that it will never be the same again.Nicely presented and beautifully filmed the cinematography by Bojan Bazelli is exquisite Herskovitz's film which is based on a true story and adapted from Margaret Rosenthal's novel by screenwriter Jeannine Dominy succinctly points up the moral hypocrisy that has always existed within any given culture or society and which will continue to exist so long as there are social institutions and structures to support them.  And the possible consequences of such diverse perspectives and attitudes when zealously pursued are effectively personified in the character of Maffio Venier Oliver Platt in whom we find the ultimate manifestation of moral decay masked by platitudes of selfserving righteousness.  Herskovitz also effectively uses the relationship between Veronica and Maffio initially a mutually agreeable rivalry a contest of words which later turns aggressively ugly as a reflection of how readily one facet of society will turn on another if but afforded the appropriate circumstances.  It's a film that works well on a number of levels as on one hand it's a love story while on the other it's an insightful dissertation on the inherent imperfections of society and the fragile moral fiber that holds it together.In the title role McCormack gives a solid performance that Veronica is beautiful is obvious but most importantly McCormack conveys her intelligence as well and it makes her character threedimensional and quite convincing.  Interestingly enough Veronica is a sympathetic character for whom nevertheless you do not necessarily feel sorry and perhaps it's because she carries herself so well and has such a strong sense of victory' about her hiding any vulnerability that would make her susceptible to pity. This is a woman who takes the detritus life throws at her and makes something of it and she does it with dignity.  If her life is morally compromised it is not due to any acquiescence on her part but rather the need and the will to survive.  This is a complex character who has to tread a number of fine lines and McCormack plays it beautifully and believably.As Marco Sewell hits his stride and turns in an excellent performance as well.  Marco is something of a pivotal character in that Veronica's response to him and their relationship becomes the most telling expression of the effects of the courtesan life on her.  And as the story unfolds Sewell does a nice job of developing his character finally achieving a depth of emotion that significantly heightens the impact of the climax. In supporting roles both Platt and Bisset give notable performances too. Platt once again demonstrates that he is one of the best character actors in the business and not only is Bisset exemplary in the role of Paola but the casting of her and McCormack as motherdaughter was inspired.The supporting cast includes Moira Kelly Beatrice Naomi Watts Guila Fred Ward Domenico Joanna Cassidy Laura Peter Eyre The Doge Justine Miceli Elena Carla Cassola Caterina Michael Culkin The Bishop and Charlotte Randle Francesca.  As Michael Corleone said at one point We're all a part of the same hypocrisy' and if there's a lesson to be learned from Dangerous Beauty' it's that one should not deign to pass judgment on another without first walking in that person's shoes.  It also reminds us of the necessity of maintaining a proper perspective and keeping in mind that what's acceptable today may not be acceptable tomorrow.  810.".

	schema:headline " Overrated as a historical drama underrated as a guilty pleasure";
	schema:reviewBody "To call Dangerous Beauty an adaptation of Margaret Rosenthal's The Honest Courtesan is beyond insulting to Ms. Rosenthal  it's bewildering quite frankly. The Veronica Franco depicted in Rosenthal's rather scholarly and unsentimental biography was a feminist heroine and a rather unusual figure for her or any time. Veronica Franco in Herskowitz's pretty romance novel is anything but a feminist heroine for all the Lifetime channel rhetoric.First a few historical corrections. According to Ms. Rosenthal's scholarship Franco's meeting with Henri III then King of Poland not yet of France and not there at request of the Doge was more important to her poetry than Venetian politics or her sex life her trial before the inquisition was quite different her relationship with the Veniers was far more professional and her life in general was far less dependent on men let alone a man. Henri III was traveling through Venice when Franco entertained him at her home and may well have slept with her. However the relationship seemed more courtly than sexual  Franco even gave him gifts on his departure two sonnets and a miniature. What Rosenthal remarks on are the sonnets she wrote in tribute to Henri in true masculine court style and the likelihood that Franco was trying to collaborate with other poets on a book in the future King of France's honor. Franco's poems on the event were courtier's poems and not love poems in fact she pulled of the rather difficult task of using the story of Jupiter and Danae as a model for her poems and undermining the eroticism her contemporaries men highlighted when using that myth. Franco often reclaimed overly sexualized female figures and made them into civic public figures  a pity that Herskowitz and script writer Dominy do the reverse to Franco.Franco's trial before the inquisition wasn't the maudlin thing it was in the movie either. It wasn't even public and her accuser was a disgruntled and unpaid tutor claiming she participated in rituals and other rites in her house. Veronica got out of it basically by admitting to allowing her servants to have these rituals and participating in them at times but she never believed in it and it wasn't a sin or demonic if one didn't believe in it. She was hardly the only person to be pulled before the inquisition at the time  Domenico Venier her patron was also brought before the inquisition because of a servant. Rather than having to defend her sexual behavior she was in the position many men found themselves in. Their financial or employment practices irked a servant and the servant accused them of heresy. Unsexy as it is Veronica's trial could be more easily compared to Martha Stewart's trial than to the sentimental theatrics in Herskowitz's film.Historically speaking there is no reason to believe that Marco and Veronica were as close as the film shows. They were friends and fellow poets with great respect for the each other's work certainly and quite possibly lovers. Veronica had many lovers though and she did not ride off to some 'happily ever after' with Marco at all. There were other lovers she seemed to be more passionate about including those who fathered some of her children also left out of the film.So as a historical drama it fails because it ignores historical fact and I think it fails even more as a feminist revision. I don't think Franco's story needs any revisionism to be feminist and certainly not of this kind. When the heroine is more than happy to commit herself entirely to a man who has no qualms about publicly humiliating a wife who never injured him and sees nothing wrong with demanding Veronica's fidelity without offering his own I can't consider her a feminist role model. When a film cheerfully sets up a dichotomy between the sexually adventurous but ultimately submissive mistress and the frigid demanding wife I can't call the film exactly a paragon of feminist values especially when the mistress wins out. Why was there no sympathy for Guilia who seemed quite unhappy with her lot and had no way out? Why no pretty speech about perpetual inconsequence for her especially when she's the one is consigned to that more than any of the others. Apparently if a woman isn't ready to be cheerfully sexually accessible to a man who can afford her she doesn't deserve decent and respectful treatment from her husband. How this is a liberating message escapes me.The only level this film does work is as a guilty pleasure and on that level it's fantastic. The cast is pretty the set is pretty the costumes are pretty the music is pretty if a bit sentimental and overpowering and if you don't think about it too hard it's a nice fairy tale. Had they not tried to base this on real people and had they deleted the ridiculous Maximfriendly justdomefeminism it would have been a satisfying romance novel of a film. However in trying to give this substance they made it at best vaguely offensive.".

A story of some historical sweep wit and romance we are first drenched in the sunlight and beauty of Venice. As the film builds I was impressed by the talent charm and strength of the hero Veronica Franco poet and courtesan.Through two amazing events she saves Venice twice first by getting help to defend itself from invasion and later by standing up for its spirit of independence. Intertwined with this is a touching romance made bitter sweet by the pressures of arranged marriages the terrible limitations upon women and the twisted power of envy. This film works on many levels the photography and music are top notch as are the settings and costumes. The acting is fine including the main roles played by Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell. Just don't expect Blanchette and Joseph Fienes. If you like historical dramas with romance intrigue and lovely scenery then I strongly recommend Dangerous Beauty.".

It's lead character is based on Veronica Franco citizen and writer from sixteenth century Venice. Margaret F Rosenthal wrote about her in The Honest Courtesan.The acting is superb...the period costuming is fantastic. As is the scenery. This is a must see on many levels.The courtesans in this era were intelligent witty and refined. Married woman of the time the wealthy ones were confined to a very dull life while their husbands entertained themselves with well educated courtesans. The courtesans were the only women allowed in the libraries of the day. As much as I love books...there is no doubt in my mind as to what role I would have chose! lol The movie revolves around those of wealth. The poor women of the day are in terrible straits...I'm glad this era is over.Seriously this is a wonderful movie visually. And it is spiced with some interesting bits of history.It is not one to take your kids to which usually causes me to deduct points. But the scenes that make it unsuitable for children are absolutely essential for this story. And what a wonderful story! Oh and another delight is the music. Buy the CD!".

I love both of them as actors and I was psyched when I heard they were in a movie together.Then I looked at the plot and was intrigued. I'd seen a movie similar to this Moulin Rouge. Hmm would it be as good as that? Would it be a let down? Looking at the title and the cover I wasn't expecting too much. Soft porn maybe? Eh probably. But I rented it anyways simply because I was in the mood for a period piece and Rufus Sewell is easy on the eyes. The movie ended up becoming one of my absolute favorites. It is sumptuously filmed gorgeous like staring at a beautiful painting for hours. Every piece of colors and cinematography is top notch. The acting between Sewell and McCormack is amazing astounding. I fell in love with their romance. The film hasn't left me long after I saw it. The score is brilliant. George Fenton is an emotional genius. If you want to hear more of his stuff just check out Ever After starring Dougray Scott and Drew Barrymore. I really want to buy this movie. It works so well and it is just really really good. It's a movie to be felt not explained. If you love intriguing plot lines romance and period pieces then I highly recommend you check this out. ".

I shall warn you that the film is neither as sexy as it may seem nor is it nearly as well told as some may lead you to believe. The story here is definitely an interesting one and even a fairly important one However the execution leaves a lot to be desired.The film claims to be a true story which much of it likely is but it is not told in an authentic way whatsoever and that is my biggest dislike of the film. Few of the scenes seem like they are something that would have gone down quite the way the film tells us they did. It's just too far from reality. I'm not totally against films being unreal or fantastical But to me it just doesn't work well when you claim that you are telling a true story but then most of the film is filled with scenes that don't really feel like they are portraying real characters and situations. This film feels more like a cartoon version of Venice circa the late 1500's early 1600's. Nothing really fits quite right in this film despite the good story and even at times despite some good dialogue. There are better versions of Fanny Hill out there that are comparable to this and certainly more believable.I'm sure this is one of those rare case of where a film about a prostitute is actually more appealing to women then to men. Like another well known film of this sort Pretty Woman the film mixes prostitution with romance which to me is not a problem at all if it's pulled off well. Unfortunately it just isn't pulled off that well in this case. Pretty Woman is easily a better film in my view at least it has some good laughs and some fun and engaging characters which this film for the most part does not.My rating 4.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Dangerous Beauty pretends to be the story of reallife 16thcentury Venetian courtesan Veronica Franco.  In reality it is an attempt to rewrite history to suit the wishful thinking of pseudofeminist ideology.I have no objection to making a professional prostitute the heroine of the story.  The contempt that society then and now showers on such women while excusing the men who pay them for their services is rank hypocrisy.  And it is true just as the movie claims that many Venetian courtesans became wealthy welleducated and independent women.  The nightmare of drug addiction violence and de facto slavery to a pimp that is prostitution in modern America was not true of prostitution in all places and times.The movie still glamorizes the profession far beyond what the historical record will support.  The historical Veronica Franco suffered frequently from the occupational diseases of prostitutes but this Veronica is always hale and hearty.  Hilariously we also discover that 16thcentury Venice has already invented a safe effective morningafter pill enabling Catherine McCormack to avoid the real Veronica Franco's numerous pregnancies. Still if Dangerous Beauty had done no worse than this it could still have been enjoyable if silly for these historical absurdities do not amount to gratuitous slanders against Veronica's noncourtesan contemporaries.Much worse is the pretense that prostitution was women's only path to education and influence in Renaissance Italy.  Excuse me but Isabella d'Este and Beatrice Sforza might have a word or two to say about that. Read Castiglione's Il Cortigiano' and you will see that educated women were a staple of Renaissance Italy's upper crust poorer women remained uneducated of course but so did poorer men.  Indeed Castiglione was careful to include education as one of the attributes of the ideal female courtier.The movie further kicks marriage in the teeth a married woman expresses envy for Veronica's position and bemoans that being a wife is a state of perpetual inconsequence.'  Merely because women not just wives were unconscionably mistreated in that age we are expected to swallow the idea that the woman who ran the household and raised moulded and educated the children and who could not be divorced without an expensive and hardtoget dispensation from the Pope was less consequential' than a prostitute men used and forgot the next week.Still more disgusting is the movie's attempt to disparage love itself.  I have no personal moral objections to prostitution when one willing person sells her body to another willing person it may be considered an offense against God depending on your religious beliefs but it is not an offense against people.  No person is hurt by the exchange.  But to mislabel this morally neutral commercial transaction as love' is to do both love and prostitution a horrible injustice it turns prostitution into a fraud while turning love into a trifle.  Veronica is presented as giving the priceless gift of love' for only 100 ducats a pop! to men who are assumed to be incapable of loving the women they live with and raise children with. Well loveless marriages have always existed but there have always been loving ones too even in the days when bride and groom never met before their wedding.  There was never a loving trick turned.It is not only the movie's attitude toward women that is unhealthy its view of men is warped too.  We are presented with that clich that turned up in the '70s the sexually frustrated man Oliver Platt here as inherently evil and malicious.  On the other hand we are shown that sadistic rapistmurderers present no danger at all if you know what they really want which is to be dominated.  Why didn't the thousands of women killed by such creeps think of that?Having said all this I must reluctantly admit that the acting by all parties is good and the sets and costumes beautiful.  If you think that excuses this movie's lying in an evil cause you're wrong.  Leading man Rufus Sewell had the honesty to admit that this movie was unadulterated horse manure.  Better that the rest of us admit it too.Rating  out of .Recommendation Unless you're writing a thesis on pseudofeminist distortions of history give this movie a wide berth.".

If you just let the overbearing background music tell you how to feel then you'll survive this movie and may even enjoy it.  If you don't think then you'll find something for everyone.  From sword fights war and gratuitous breasts for the guys to romance medieval dresses and Venice for the ladies.

It's not that the movie is confusing there has to be at least an attempt at complexity for that. It's that the characters act in such a senseless way that there's no way to imagine any real person doing what they do in spite of the scenesetting opening paragraph that tells us that this REALLY DID HAPPEN.The baseline is that Dangerous Beauty tries really hard to be a good drama about defying society convention and women's gender roles.  Problem is that it turns out being a bad melodrama about following society's rules and staying behind a man.  Dangerous Beauty got a 2.  That includes an extra point because they tried so hard.".

Ms. McCormack seems to be molded from the same line of icy blond beauties that produced Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett. I think Ms. McCormack has the edge in looks acting ability and on screen passion. It doesn't seem fair that the former are mega stars and no one seems to know Catherine McCormack. Se was also excellent in A Sound of Thunder  another of my favorite movies.The movie itself features a number of my favorite actors and it is beautifully filmed. The Italian Renaissance costumes are exquisite particularly the apricotpeach dress she wears on her first night as a courtesan. I want that dress and I want that life! The relationship with Marco is okay nothing that hasn't been done a thousand times. It's the scenes of her mother teaching her to be a courtesan the scenes of her learning her way among men the poetry battles her charming nervous fumbling on her first night with a man her exquisite verbal fluency and ability to hold her own in a maledominated world that really captured my attention.This is a beautiful historical romancedrama with quality in every aspect  the music the costuming the sets the cinematography. The acting is first rate across the board. Everyone turns in an outstanding performance. The fact that the movie is based on historical fact is simply a bonus. I think every woman longs to be Veronica Franco at some point.".

No danger of that for Veronica whose mane flows free even when she might dress down a little to hide from the hoi polloi who are blaming her sinful ways for the plague that visits 16th Century Venice.Rufus Sewell plays nobleman Marco Venier who loves her but must marry someone else for the good of the family fortune. He plays the role like a caddy to McCormack which is the way men appear in romance novels. McCormack herself gives only a workmanlike performance that cannot lift this historical romance above the usual paperback issue. We really needed Kate Winslet but perhaps she read the script. The rather routine indictment of the Inquisition and soft revelations of the hypocrisy of the Venetian nobility can't disguise the fact that this is a women's fantasyfulfillment indulgence all the way and nothing more. The movie is also political correct in the tiresome manner of the 1990's when women must be shown as triumphing over men through the sheer power of their cleverness and superior moxie or put another way through having bigger balls.Once again Hollywood celebrates the high class whore as being ahead of her time. We see her gain admiration and riches as she develops a worldly sophistication second perhaps only to that of the Pope. Yet there is some truth to this stale notion. To make it work though we needed to see Veronica's seamy side to experience the crudity of her lascivious and exploitive nature. Instead we have a fairy tale princess whore Snow White turning tricks in gorgeous gowns sans syphilis sans beatings sans pimp. Jacqueline Bisset is competent as the mother who teaches her daughter how to exploit men. As a pep talk she tells Veronica that courtesans are the best educated women and you are following in the footsteps of Cleopatra. I think the historical fact if fact it is that the only women who were allowed to read in 16th century Venice were courtesans confused the designers of this tale into thinking that courtesans were the superior ladies of Venetian society. They were the only women allowed in the library because they were considered already corrupted. The whole movie suffers from this sort of gee whiz this is so eyeopening for our times treatment. The climactic scene before the Inquisition in particular is embarrassing in the melodramatic naivet of its phony development. Hollywood is again attempting to rewrite history in light of the current PC agenda. Alas however wasn't it always thus?".

I ordered the DVD years ago and watch Dangerous Beauty at least once per month... it is by far the best romance with humor witt  action to also keep a man engaged... it is NOT your typical chick flick... and can be enjoyed by many... I have just allowed my 14 yr.old daughters to watch it since there are some sexual scenes that may not be appropriate for young viewers but there are a lot worse movies out there done in less tasteful ways... this movie has touched my heart and will always remain my favorite. I suggest anyone who has an ounce of romance in them to watch it...  I have read other reviews and I will only say that those who are looking into this through the eyes of 'today' will only miss the true meaning of the movie... Courtesan's had to do what they did to survive those without family bloodlines were denied most... Catherine McCormack shows us through the life of Veronica Franco that this movie is NOT a 'soft porn' but the reality of women during the 16th Century! Only the closed minded would view this movie as a 'soft porn'.".

An indepth exploration on the themes of racism and prejudice cause and effect chance and coincidence and tragedy crash is a metaphor for the collisions between strangers in the course of daytoday existence. Set over a 24hour period in contemporary L.A. it is a social commentary on the interconnectedness of life in the big city.Crash features a topnotch ensemble cast which includes Sandra Bullock Don Cheadle Matt Dillon Jennifer Esposito Brendan Fraser Chris Ludacris Bridges Loretta Devine Thandie Newton Ryan Phillipe and Larenz Tate. All put in superb performances in a tight script which is at once gritty heartwarming shocking tragic and witty and which will ring true with viewers of all demographics.Centering around two disturbing car accidents a carjacking vicious workplace vandalism and the suspicious shooting death of one police officer by another the drama is set against the backdrop of a racist LAPD and Los Angeles justice system. Action shifts between the various characters whose lives collide with each other in unpredictable ways as each faces their own moral dilemma and tries to cope with the consequences of their resulting decision made or action taken. Each of the dozen or so main characters undergoes some type of a personal metamorphosis as the various story lines head toward a striking common conclusion which succeeds at being both cathartic and unsettling.Crash is backed by a solid and varied original soundtrack and excellent cinematography. Sweeping wider shots alternate with disjointed camera angles which convey the chaos and confusion of the characters and the unpredictability of life. Occasional lingering closeups  on occasion without sound  capture the actors' facial expressions which suitably detail key moments of the characters' aching pain fear anger bitter anguish remorse or grief far better than any dialogue could.This breathtaking film is destined to be a critical smash and boxoffice hit.

	schema:headline " Volatile Redemption";
	schema:reviewBody "Crash is a complex movie with a simple premise set in Los Angeles it follows 8 main characters and many many more supporting from all walks of life and races whose lives intersect at some point during one 24 hour period. These people are all different yet all alienated to the point of breaking so much so that when they come together things explode.The complexity of the film comes from the encounters between characters and their tangled lives and worlds. Haggis' screenplay is so intricate and delicately written I couldn't begin to try to summarize the actual plot line which destines this article to be kind of vague but everyone meets everyone else at some point in the film and there are a whole lot of characters. Sufficed to say these meetings are variably intense casual fleeting dangerous but they all effect the participants in profound and provocative ways causing lives to find enlightenment or swerve violently and watching it all unfold is mesmerizing because Paul Haggis Oscar Nominated writer of Million Dollar Baby made the film meaty with messy characters and topics and stories to chew and hurtle along with.The allencompassing theme of the film is racism and it is dealt with bluntly honestly and without reservation. Every single character participates in the perpetuation of the ugly cycle but also suffers because of it. Where racism makes for an interesting enough subject for an already provoking and fairly experimental film I was surprised to see this get wide release it's only the catalyst for a deeper resounding story of redemption and the universality of our lonely situation which the movie becomes during its second hour what you could call Act II. It switches from a somewhat depressing contemplative amalgamation of moments about racism in everyday life and how destructive it is to a throbbing intense web of choices and consequences  life and death vivifying or soul killing  and the chance at redemption.Following their actions in Act I everyone meets a fork in the road or is given a second chance of some sort. Some take it some don't but regardless by the end of the movie everyone has changed. This is what gives the movie wings during its second hour makes it interesting keeps you guessing and on knife'sedge. It also gives the characters depth and souls and shows that despite perceived and upheld differences when it comes down to it we aren't different which we see in a shattering scene between Ryan Philippe and Larenz Tate after Tate notices that he and Philippe have the same St. Christopher statue in fact we desperately need each other. It's one of the few films I've seen where everyone is at fault somehow and yet there are no villains. It makes it hopeful particularly with something as ugly as racism everyone's fallible but everyone has the capacity for good and nobility. That said each of these character's inner struggles makes for all the conflict and resolution you need.A talented ensemble drives the film sharing almost equal amounts of screen time but the folks who really stood out and had my full attention each time were Terrence Howard plays a TV director Matt Dillon as a patrol cop Sandra Bullock a rich housewife  Don Cheadle a detective and Michael Pea a locksmith. These five gave deeply deeply felt performances portraying a wide range of emotions and personal situations giving souls  alone yearning and searching in a world that doesn't seem to care  to shells of imperfect people. But the actors triumph in little moments of human contact a glance an embrace a pause a smile a wince things that breath the film to life and with simple visuals give it profundity. This is beautifully illustrated in a small scene between the downward spiraling Jean Sandra Bullock and her maid after she's begun to realize all her problems may not be about the two black guys who car jacked her but her own life.Some closing notes it's obvious it's a debut. At times the dialogue and acting can be stilted and unnatural some of the initial racial situations seem forced certain scenes could have used some editing or fine tuning but by the end I didn't care. It also may be helpful to know that the first hour spends its time setting everything up for Act II although it will seem more like a photo essay on racism than a setup. But by the time Act I ends you're ready for something substantial to happen and at the perfect moment stuff happens. I was entirely satisfied with this movie I couldn't have asked for anything more. Still it's impressive with his debut Haggis made a film that magically maintains a storytelling balancing act about people's lives that almost seamlessly flows takes an honest look at racism with an understanding of mankind a belief in redemption and even hope. As I walked out of the theater into the rainy night it resonated with me and colored my thoughts as I made my way through the crowds of unknown fellow people filling the cinema. That's about all I can ask for in a film.".

	schema:headline " Great acting ensemble but the movie left a bad taste in my mouth";
	schema:reviewBody "THE GOOD The acting were great especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor instead of Matt Dillon.THE BAD I'm a visible minority nonwhite and I have experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT despite my life experiences and the movie's subject matter I would definitely NOT say that this movie is the best of the year in fact it's FAR from it. I have problems with this movie both from a moviegoer's perspective and from a visible minority's perspective. Some of my problems with this movie are1 Poor character development or none at all. Just because we saw extremes in a character for example Matt Dillon being a racist cop and being a good caregiver to his ailing father that does not mean in any way that the character is welldeveloped. Yes I admit that in a big cast ensemble like in this movie it is quite difficult for every character to be welldeveloped BUT that does not mean that at none of the characters should be like that.2 The dialogue seems really contrived to the point that I'm really surprised this movie won for Best Original Screenplay. They should show this movie in a screenplay writing class NOT because it's good but to show students and future screenplay writers what NOT to do. I just felt like I've been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is. I get it.3 The plot seems so coincidental it is laughable. What are the chances of a black car robber running over an Asian guy who also happens to be a human trafficker while entering his van and that same black car robber ended up carjacking that Asian guy's van several hours later after he brought him the hospital only to find out that the several Asians being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car robber has a good side after all? Or what about that scene where a prejudiced upperclass white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred vanished into thin air? If it was THAT simple why don't we throw every racist in America down the stairs so they will have a change of heart?4 I think my biggest misgivings about this movie is the unrealistic view of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face. I've been refused to enter a supermarket because I'm not white. Did the store owner said because I was not white? No he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside. Did he yell racial slurs? No. Racism in America is more hidden. Some cab drivers probably won't stop to pick you up because you're nonwhite but that does not mean that they will try to run you over or get out and say racial slurs. If a Chinese woman rearended me I won't be saying blake! blake! Learn some English bitch!. On the other hand if I was a Chinese woman and I accidentally rearended a Mexican woman I won't say Mexicans are bad drivers in front of her face. That's not how things work. Instead I would give out my insurance info say sorry and go home and tell my fellow Chinese friends and family that Mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. That is the real racism. It's hidden and not in your face.Anyway Crash is not original unlike what some people may say. The interlocking and interweaving story lines plots and characters have been done before. Magnolia is a movie that does this much better than Crash did and yet it was never nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. It had a stellar cast  Julianne Moore William H. Macy Phillip Seymour Hoffman who won best Actor recently Tom Cruise etc. It really boggles my mind how Crash was even nominated for Best Picture.".

	schema:headline " Rollercoaster of emotions";
	schema:reviewBody "Like Altman's classic Short Cuts and Anderson's Magnolia Crash by writerdirector Paul Haggis weaves a tale of multiple characters through the web of streets we have come to know as Los Angeles. Unlike those other two films this one has a very specific theme to explore. From the opening line uttered by Don Cheadle we know this is to be a film about how people relate and from the interchange that follows between Jennifer Esposito and Alexis Rhee pretty sure she plays the Korean female driver who rearended her how people relate tends to be ruled by first impressions or prejudice.Race is paramount in this film and all our preconceptions of who people are get twisted and turned through the intricate plot. With each new additional character we find another assumption another stereotype and then watch as that preconception is obliterated as the character develops. It is a credit to the deftly written script tight direction and exceptional acting talent that every one of these many characters is fully realized on screen without ever feeling onedimensional.I would love to discuss some of the details of what happens to explain how well it is done but part of the magic of this film is allowing yourself to be taken on this ride. Mind you this isn't a ride of pleasure. The first half of this film is unrelentingly in its ferociousness. I could literally feel my rage at some of the characters forming to a fever pitch. The fear and hatred I was confronting wasn't just on the screen but in the pit of my stomach. And in one absolutely brilliant moment I was literally sobbing at the expectation of horror unfolding only to be cathartically released in a most unexpected way.Mr. Haggis was in attendance at the screening I saw and explained that the idea for this film came to him one night sometime after 911 at about 2a.m. when his own memories of a car jacking experience from 10 years before wouldn't leave him alone. Clearly this film was his way of relieving those demons of memory using the catharsis of his art to unleash them and in doing so has given to all viewers of cinema an opportunity to examine our own preconceptions about race relations and how we treat each other and think of ourselves. He mentioned in the discussion afterwards that he likes to make films that force people to confront difficult issues. Films that ask people to think after the film has ended and not just leave saying that was a nice film.This isn't a nice film and I would expect that it will provoke many a discussion in the ensuing weeks when it opens nationwide. It's a discussion long overdue for this country and it took a Canadian to bring the issue to the fore in this brilliant thought provoking film.".

The only reason that I can think of for the number of good reviews is that it's being reviewed by people who aren't used to thinking or who've seen their first thoughtprovoking movie and somehow think that Haggis invented the concept. In fact he basically made this film which should be called Racism For Dummies as emotionally wrenching as possible seemingly to give people who don't spend a lot of time thinking the impression that they've discovered some fundamental truth that's never been covered in a film before. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintanence it's not... An afterschool special for the unthinking masses cut into bitesized overwrought hamfisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection.It's as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme simply to make us happy that we're such good people because we don't identify with the characters. Let's face it people. NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes. It's well acted even if the dialog is atrocious and cleverly executed so much that you don't think to ask where's the beef? until you can tell the film is winding down. The flaming car scene was well executed like much of the movie but went nowhere in the end. The messages are very heavyhanded and from the behind the scenes blurb the producers were clearly watching a different movie because there is very little to laugh about in this movie even during the intended funny parts. I have to stress that this is NOT entertainment more like a high school diversity lesson...call it the Blood on the Highway of racism. They could even show this in high schools if it weren't for the sidenude shot of Jennifer Esposito.In this film everyone's a jerk and everyone learns a lesson except for Michael Pena who gets the best role but the most predictable storyline.This is a bad film with bad writing and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.Crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.".

In watching the film it looks like some nonCalifornian's nonLA person's perspective on race relations in LA. The characters are exaggerations the overwhelming focus on blackwhite relations obscures the multiracial fabric of the LA landscape and the Asian characters eg. one is smuggling Chinese illegal aliens and another is screaming racial epithets are the worst kind of stereotyping. The only portrayal in the film that is accurate is of the corrupt cops which as anyone who lived through the Rodney King years 1992 will tell you are all too real. But then the film turned around and offered redemption for that bastard cop by allowing him to rescue the same woman he molestedraped? What kind of crap is this! That's not even counting the stylistic choices made in the film to try to make LA look like Chicago and New York with people wearing scarves and such and having it snow in the city as if that would ever happen!. People in LA rarely ever wear scarves because it is rarely that cold and the way they made the characters do this shows that this film is made about other cities in the US and only used LA as the background because of the controversial nature of the 1992 riots.I would have to say that based on my experiences in LA I have seldom seen people engage in outright racial slurs because they know they will get beat down pretty quickly. Additionally for Angelenos who have grown up in local multiracial high schools the mere fact that people grow up living next to and learning with people of many different types encourages greater understanding of difference. If there are racial issues at certain local high schools they are more often caused by gang conflict over turf issues than by internal prejudice. Maybe the racial dynamics mentioned in the film hold for people in other cities but they're not walking the same streets riding the same buses and talking to the same people in the community as I have. In fact I would argue that the biggest problems are caused by all the starry eyed hillbillies that move to LA from places outside of California and bring their prejudices with them. This movie is terrible and the fact that people have made a big fuss about it is evidence of how out of touch people are with LA.".

It's not really that I found the film offensive or anything  just that the script was unbelievably amateurish for a film that had obviously had a bit of money thrown at it. I really respected Paul Haggis' work on the Million Dollar Baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was. It was clear to me that it was desperate to be the 'racism' version of Traffic but I don't think Traffic was really a film worth ripping off in the first place. The worst feature of thisfilm is the way it shamelessly spoonfeeds its audience. Does Haggisreally think we are so dumb as to require a shot of the blanks? Do wereally need to see the phone book sitting on Farhad's dashboard withthe address circled in black texta? Can we not be left to make someleaps in logic for ourselves? I also had a major problem with the dialogue which was so 'on the nose'. I have heard one critic say that the quality of dialogue is deceptively high because even though people may not speak this way they certainly do think this way. That is irrelevant. It is the job of a script like this to utilise dialogue in a way that helps add to the characterisations and believability of the in this case highly implausible situations that are set up. These characters all speak using the same voice and all they ever talk about is racism. Surely the purpose of a film like this should be to promote the fact that race should not really be an issue in these situations but by making it the sole focus of every scene doesn't it become innately racist itself? Characters walk around spouting their philosophies and conveniently memorised statistics on race relations as though they're regurgitating extracts from the research essay they've just written. It's utterly unconvincing and obvious. A film should reveal its meaning gradually not slap us in the face with it in the opening scenes and then never let up. I can see that Haggis' intentions with this film were honorable but dare I suggest that by directing his own script he has not been able to identify and therefore overcome its flaws. I really hope that writerdirectors will be really careful in future when approaching this 'mosaic' style of narrative. It has been done well a number of times but getting the balance between the personal and the political right is very difficult. And Robert Altman will not be outdone in that department.".

	schema:headline " ...And Burn";
	schema:reviewBody "I wrote this as a two part review. Part two has spoilers.Part 1 No this isn't that one about the sex with car accidents. This is the one about racism in L.A. You know the one where everybody is a racist and race is the topic on everybody's mind at all times. Race.Its like the movie has a form of turrets syndrome where race is the constant theme. Race. Racist. Racism. Race Relations. Relay race.Paul Haggis made a movie which took the structure of Magnolia which was used to show the disconnect of people who are tangentially connected and then screwed it into a 1'53 mental vomit about racism in America. RACE. In the 24 hour period we have 7 stories running parallel all connected and about race. The first hour people say ridiculous stuff and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in America.For example the story with Ludicrous and Larenz Tate provides the comic relief. Too bad the first half of their story is lifted straight from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction. RACISM. Their section is the Quentin Tarantino section where instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion the characters talk about race and racism. CONSTANTLY. The other good thing about it is the Mexican story when the Mexican guy is talking to his daughter. He gives her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her from bullets. Decent writing but that's only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would say in his place.The rest of the stories are extremely ludicrous. The Hindi does not act in any semblance of realism. The scene where he's trying to get the lock fixed and the Mexican tells him he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid. Why would anybody act like that? Is it realistic? NOOO. It reminds me more of the convenience store clerk from The Doom Generation. Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents girly. If i ever watch the second half of the movie I hope his head is shot off and his bodiless head starts coughing up relish.I haven't mentioned race in over a paragraph. RACE. RACISM. RACE FOR THE SUN. Better. Then there is the black guy who wants to be white Matt Dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks Ryan Phillippe who looks beautiful and does nothing and various other bad actors acting badly with bad dialog. When Matt Dillon molests the black producers wife could I help it if I was cracking up? When Philippe is second guessing his writing up of his partner for racism can I help but crack up? The movie is so funny when it is being racist. Racist. RACIST I tell you.Now mind you this movie was nominated for Best Picture Best Director Best Screenplay and Best Editing besides a nod to Matt Dillon who actually did attempt to do a decent job. Who was paid off for that one I have no clue.Don't see it unless you feel like being preached at about the racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script from 2 white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with real society in any way shape or form.D Part 2The second half of Crash takes any and all story lines in the first half...and spews them back out in a sort of redemptive conclusionary the world is a big coincidence kind of way. And it is in fact one of the worst ways to do it.Take 1999's Magnolia. People weren't conveniently tied together over and over again. They were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know somebody who knows somebody who did something that you knew somebody else was also involved in. Crash takes this wrapping into a serious extreme.The stories are lined up so everybody meets again. Are there only 5 on the LAPD force? Aren't these people working weird shifts? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift then an early one the next day? And why did Tate have to be the murdered hitchhiker? Wouldn't it have had more emotional tension as well as realism if it had been somebody we had not been following all day long? Like Phillippe just picks up a random hitchhiker and then freaks out. Everybody'd be freaking out.Eventually in the second half the touching invisible cloak scene is used to get the Hindi to shoot the daughter. It ticked me off and made me feel dirty. Not that the Hindi shot the daughter but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then had it be the direct cause of people tearing up. It really ticked me off. At the writers not the scene.The whole movie is fake and totally uncalled for. The coincidences are far too many and they require an extreme suspension of disbelief. Unlike Magnolia which was connected mildly this had connections upon connections upon connections which were just so overthetop. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock falls down the stairs. She doesn't die though. She should have. I cheered when she fell.The worst part about the movie is it pulls a Magnolia. Not just in structure but it has a montage over the song In the Deep where you see everybody being depressed. Magnolia took this and had postmodern commentary on it by having all of the characters singing along to Aimee Mann's Wise Up. Unfortunately Magnolia came out in 1999 while Crash came out in 2005. Its hard to make commentary on a movie which won't be made for another 6 years but it happened. Somehow.Utter waste of my time.First half D Second half lowest grade ever Overall F".

	onyx:emotionText "I wrote this as a two part review. Part two has spoilers.Part 1 No this isn't that one about the sex with car accidents. This is the one about racism in L.A. You know the one where everybody is a racist and race is the topic on everybody's mind at all times. Race.Its like the movie has a form of turrets syndrome where race is the constant theme. Race. Racist. Racism. Race Relations. Relay race.Paul Haggis made a movie which took the structure of Magnolia which was used to show the disconnect of people who are tangentially connected and then screwed it into a 1'53 mental vomit about racism in America. RACE. In the 24 hour period we have 7 stories running parallel all connected and about race. The first hour people say ridiculous stuff and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in America.For example the story with Ludicrous and Larenz Tate provides the comic relief. Too bad the first half of their story is lifted straight from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction. RACISM. Their section is the Quentin Tarantino section where instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion the characters talk about race and racism. CONSTANTLY. The other good thing about it is the Mexican story when the Mexican guy is talking to his daughter. He gives her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her from bullets. Decent writing but that's only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would say in his place.The rest of the stories are extremely ludicrous. The Hindi does not act in any semblance of realism. The scene where he's trying to get the lock fixed and the Mexican tells him he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid. Why would anybody act like that? Is it realistic? NOOO. It reminds me more of the convenience store clerk from The Doom Generation. Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents girly. If i ever watch the second half of the movie I hope his head is shot off and his bodiless head starts coughing up relish.I haven't mentioned race in over a paragraph. RACE. RACISM. RACE FOR THE SUN. Better. Then there is the black guy who wants to be white Matt Dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks Ryan Phillippe who looks beautiful and does nothing and various other bad actors acting badly with bad dialog. When Matt Dillon molests the black producers wife could I help it if I was cracking up? When Philippe is second guessing his writing up of his partner for racism can I help but crack up? The movie is so funny when it is being racist. Racist. RACIST I tell you.Now mind you this movie was nominated for Best Picture Best Director Best Screenplay and Best Editing besides a nod to Matt Dillon who actually did attempt to do a decent job. Who was paid off for that one I have no clue.Don't see it unless you feel like being preached at about the racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script from 2 white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with real society in any way shape or form.D Part 2The second half of Crash takes any and all story lines in the first half...and spews them back out in a sort of redemptive conclusionary the world is a big coincidence kind of way. And it is in fact one of the worst ways to do it.Take 1999's Magnolia. People weren't conveniently tied together over and over again. They were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know somebody who knows somebody who did something that you knew somebody else was also involved in. Crash takes this wrapping into a serious extreme.The stories are lined up so everybody meets again. Are there only 5 on the LAPD force? Aren't these people working weird shifts? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift then an early one the next day? And why did Tate have to be the murdered hitchhiker? Wouldn't it have had more emotional tension as well as realism if it had been somebody we had not been following all day long? Like Phillippe just picks up a random hitchhiker and then freaks out. Everybody'd be freaking out.Eventually in the second half the touching invisible cloak scene is used to get the Hindi to shoot the daughter. It ticked me off and made me feel dirty. Not that the Hindi shot the daughter but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then had it be the direct cause of people tearing up. It really ticked me off. At the writers not the scene.The whole movie is fake and totally uncalled for. The coincidences are far too many and they require an extreme suspension of disbelief. Unlike Magnolia which was connected mildly this had connections upon connections upon connections which were just so overthetop. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock falls down the stairs. She doesn't die though. She should have.

It is baffling to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by its pretentiousness. I want to comment on the Matt Dillon character as an example of what's most infuriating about this movie. Here we have a man who  contrasted with the film's underlying message that we're all a LITTLE racist  effectively rapes a woman in public cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately goading him to make a move that as he well knows will lead to his arrest or even death. He does all this after pulling the couple over without any legal cause but because as we come to understand they are black and wealthy and he is a hurt little boy who is now the police and can therefore do as he pleases. This behavior is not a LITTLE racist. This behavior is evil. It is disturbing to me that this extreme of racism is held up next to another character's behavior  spouting her paranoid stereotypes about gang violence  to illustrate that everybody's a LITTLE racist. Later we're spoonfed some tripe about Dillon's poor old dad and how black folks drove him into the poor house. Is this supposed to explain or worse excuse this behavior? And is Dillon's character meant to redeem himself by committing the utterly unmotivated and unbelievable laughably coincidental act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted the very night before? Please. The fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of selfcongratulatory admiration for this film makes me feel sad about the shallowness of our understanding of racism and our apparent lack of commitment to condemning and ending it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away Sigourney Weaver in Aliens 1986? Or have I crossed over into some alternative Twilight Zone universe where ugly is beautiful and bad is good? On March 5 2006 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did something so inexplicable that my head is still spinning. The Academy voted one of the worst films ever made Best Picture. You heard me right Crash is one of the worst films ever made. No Crash isn't bad in the way of Plan Nine from Outer Space. Crash is bad because it thinks it is so good and that its message is so important that it bears repeating over and over and over again until everyone gets it. But what is the message of Crash? There seems to be some confusion about this aspect of the film which I will clear up for you. In its simplest form the message of Crash is people can be categorized into racial stereotypes and it is understandable that we are prejudiced towards them. For example the film shows us that all young black men are carjackers and criminals and it is perfectly justified for white women to fear them. All Asians but especially Asian women are bad drivers and talk funny. Another example is that all white cops are prejudiced against blacks. Even white cops that appear to be good on the outside are all racists. When the least bit frustrated white cops will molest black women instead of kicking the dog and white cops will shoot young black men in the blink of an eye for simply reaching in their pocket. Rich white women all hate Hispanics and treat their Hispanic maids like dirt. Black women are all drug addicts on welfare or have funny names. Okay maybe that's only one of the messages of the film. I guess another message of Crash is that everyone is prejudiced towards some race and that includes the writer director and producer. Well to be fair the writers Haggis and Moresco director Haggis and the many producers are just prejudiced toward blacks Asians and Persians they have no problem with Hispanics. Hispanics are the only good people in the film and have no prejudices. Oh I forgot! Hispanics are prejudiced against bad driving funny talking Asian women. Another Crash message is that if you're having a bad day if you're father is having health problems of course you're going to be a racist. After all isn't everyone? I know you're confused now because you and so many others were tricked by the film into believing that it was against racism. Don't feel bad because the writers and director of Crash use every trick in the book to manipulate you into thinking that because they had some noble cause for making the film it is appropriate to use racial stereotypes. After all the Academy had no problem with it so why should you.Okay so the message of Crash is that racial stereotypes exist and everyone is prejudiced is kind of disgusting but does that in itself make it one of the worst films? No there are countless other flaws with the screenplay that make this film one of the worst. The only positive thing I can say about the script is that it is going to be a great teaching tool to show students what not to do when writing a screenplay. For example in the very first scene of the film Don Cheadle and his partner Jennifer Esposito get into a minor car accident. Cheadle then says the following It's the sense of touch. In any real city you walk you know? You brush past people people bump into you. In L.A. nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other just so we can feel something. Can anyone explain to me why the Academy awarded this Best Original Screenplay? It's like it was written by some pretentious high school student trying to show off to the teacher.Besides the clunky pretentious dialog the screenwriters overuse irony to a degree I can't remember seeing in any other film. It's like they are going to hit us over the head with irony until we just know what great writers they are. After this film Congress should pass a law limiting impossible ironic coincidences and ironic twists to no more than two per film. Hefty fines should be levied for each one over the limit. By my count there are a minimum of 15 ironic coincidences or twists in Crash. How many can you come up with? Maybe this could be a fun party game like Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.I want to give one more specific example of the many problems with screenplay but I'm hard pressed to talk about just one. Maybe it should be the carjackers or maybe the invisible cloak or the second car crash. I just can't decide. Well I'll just end with snow. On at least a few occasions different characters in the film mention that the weather calls for possibility of snow in Los Angeles the last time it snowed in LA was 1962. At the end of the film white flakes fall from the sky but they are the ashes from a burning car which was the site of a racially motivated murder. I'm not sure what the screenwriters had in mind with this scene but I'm sure it was another heavyhanded allusion to something very deep. Maybe it was the ashes of racial hatred raining down on the city? And again the Academy voted this Best Picture.".

I was engladdened at first because it seemed like it might be another Magnolia type movie but in the end the only comparison to Magnolia was the neat hippie music and the lack of resolution in many try every one of the story lines. Racism was a central theme but as it pertained to this story it was a seemingly desultory random element that was artificially injected at random points. The racism was extremely unnatural and forced and out of place in many instances. The result was that the movie came across not as being edgy and truthful like people are pretending this movie is but rather ignorant and contrived at best. For example the crack by Cheadle about all those cultures getting together and deciding to park their cars on their lawns was from left field and artificially inflammatory coming from a character who previously and thereafter gave us no racist indicators at all. There were no clues up to that point or after that he was racist or capable of such a statement it was out of place in the conversation too and the line had no place in his character or in the movie. And no saying everyone is racist and that's why he said it is not true and not acceptable. The line was out of character out of place and therefore without taste. Some of the stories were good but only up until race was artificially inseminated all over the screen. Additionally the whole movie was highly predictable. The scenes with the shopkeeper the gun the dead kid at the beginning of the movie etc.  all predicted easily by me and if I can predict events in a movie that is not a good thing at all. The clincher though that was the bizarre late night country music I feel like picking up a random black youth in an apparent act of kindness and then ignorantly and confrontationally stereotyping him to his face even though it is out of my character and it was in fact my partner who was the racist one not me scene with Ryan Pillippie's character who also presented no pre or post incident racist tendencies. What the heck was that? That should have been a deleted scene. On top of all this the movie needed another 30 minutes at least to at least bring one or two more stories to conclusion. The Phillippe thing and the Cheadle Latino crack really bothered me the most though. I mean I could buy the Sandra Bullock snooty rich white lady thing but the rest was way too much. I think the fact that someone wrote a movie that says all people are racist says quite a lot about the writers and all the people involved but says nothing about society as the movie had no realism whatsoever. The movie was almost complete in it's failure but for Hollywood to admit that would mean so much more than just pretending it makes some kind of aweinspiring statement about race. I hate to tell them and all of Hollywood that hailed this movie but this has already been done and with more success although still flawed in the movie Grand Canyon. It is a far superior movie with race as the central theme. It was challenging and in your face and honest in the way Crash wishes it was but with an inferior cast and far far less hype. If Hollywood really wanted to embrace racism being pushed to the forefront and being examined then Bamboozled would have won best picture the year it came out or at least been nominated.".

It is a far superior movie with race as the central theme. It was challenging and in your face and honest in the way Crash wishes it was but with an inferior cast and far far less hype. If Hollywood really wanted to embrace racism being pushed to the forefront and being examined then Bamboozled would have won best picture the year it came out or at least been nominated.";

I felt compelled to come to IMDb and give it a one star rating because there is no way that this movie should be in rated in the top 250.Let me just say this RACISM IS NOT A NEW IDEA. People are lauding Crash as if it is some sort of godsent piece of artwork that is going to suddenly open the world's eyes to racial tensions. All this movie does is compile a ton of characters that are lame racial stereotypes whom we've seen millions of times over. Even worse there are so many characters masquerading as racial stereotypes that the movie completely fails to perform an indepth examination of ANY OF THEM. Each of the characters gets maybe 10 minutes of screen time and that is it. For example You get the bigot white cop you watch him be racist you see that he has a soft side he ends up saving a black woman END OF STORY. I have no idea how this movie won an Academy Award for Best Picture for it is a poorly executed hodgepodge of stereotypes that goes absolutely nowhere.".

Obnoxiously slapping the audience in the face with its selfrighteousness in every scene Crash manages to be become the only film to which I have 'awarded' the lowest score to on IMDb 210. I can't even believe how terrible this film is. I don't even know what the 2 is for because no redeeming aspects come to mind as I write this.The content is racism if that wasn't clear enough. The events in the film are all shadowed by racial prejudice. The characters are all of different races. All people ever talk about in the film is racism. They do not talk about it casually as a means to make the dialog believable or accessible but whatever is said are readilymade perfectlycrafted speeches on racist issues that sound like they've been taken from an opinion column in a political magazine. So Crash drills these things into your head at all times thereby cheapening its message  which is essentially that racism is bad and that we stereotype based on race 010 for originality!. Ironically what is most disturbing about the film is not the racial stereotypes that are present but that American audiences NEED to be told these things and need such obvious morals to be spelled out for them and need a guy like Haggis shaking their finger at them telling you that is bad behaviour. This fills me with concern for the intelligence of the average moviegoer. After all how can you applaud a film that states the obvious?The icing of the cake of a dreadful film for me was the scene in which the little cutesy Latina girl is 'shot' trying to protect her father Hispanic guy whose name I cannot recall as the only thing that is put forward in Crash is a person's race. As she jumps in front of her father to take the bullet for him there is THE cheesiest most sorrowful score imaginable playing loudly and the American flag blowing in the wind in the background of the shot. This scene is one of the worst cheapest in film history. Who can honestly sit and watch that with a straight face?I can only assume that the big budget of Crash was spent on late night tacoruns as nothing of substance is presented to us. Offensively poor writing contrived performances endless clichs make this simply an unwatchable film. To call it manipulative is giving it too much credit as that implies the clever disguise of intentions and messages and Crash does not even try to disguise anything  it just preaches. 210".

Wow! What a cast! Bullock has never been in a good movie so this fact alone spells trouble.Alone that scene with Dillon molesting the black director's wife guaranteed this silly movie an Oscar for Best Picture. By the way that black couple DID engage in reckless driving because the woman gave him a blowjob while he was driving so the LEAST Dillon could have done is annoy the slut a with a bit of copafeel no pun intended. Regardless of race this should be done to ANY slut who gives a guy fellatio while driving. The fact that Dillon happens to be a racist  as ALL cops seem to be in Hollywood movies  changes nothing.Talk about a coincidence plotdevice of the DECADE when Dillon saves the same black woman THE NEXT DAY no not a month later THE NEXT DAY. And as if one such plotdevice wasn't enough we get ANOTHER coincidence not much later when the black director  yes the woman's husband  has an encounter with the OTHER cop from the night before Phillipe. Phillipe is the good white cop. And it is in this scene that we have the dumbest moment in the movie the director goes berserk when the two carthief blacks attack him  and then PREACHES to the taller one about being an embarrassment to him i.e. the black race and LETS HIM GO but not before HANDING HIM HIS GUN BACK!!!!!!! Those two carthieves. What ridiculous characterization! The way they suddenly assault FraserBullock is something out of a ZAZ comedy. It's as if this scene got accidentally edited into the wrong movie. The two lack credibility. They philosophize like Travolta and Jackson in Pulp Fiction  except that this is supposed to be a deep drama so it comes off all wrong. First the taller one is paranoid about racism the shorter one making fun of that and then  inexplicably  they SWITCH PERSONALITIES the shorter one defends rap music and makes fun of country being racist while the taller one criticizes hiphop for being primitive. Ludicrous? Yes ludicrous. Aside from that how many young black criminals who look like hiphop actually CRITICIZE hiphop?? This is silly and unrealistic. I halfenjoyed what was said about the rap culture but it came out of the WRONG CHARACTER's mouth. Or is it supposed to be funny and ironic that Ludicrous is saying it? Haha. Hilarious...We have plenty of other nonsensecoincidences that just keep piling up. The way the Persian storekeeper shootsmisses the locksmith's daughter was straight out of the Cheap And Overused PlotDevices Throughout The Ages handbook. And then we had the U.S. flag waving in the background as the Persian guy looks helplessly into the distance. It's obvious that the director completed the Cheap MovieCriticPleasing Symbolism 101 movie course. Oh and Fraser playing a D.A. not as absurd as Denise Richards playing a scientist but thereabouts.Hollywood simply cannot let it go. They HAVE to keep trying and trying to solve racism in America. But how can a bunch of uneducated uninformed hypocrites tell us anything intelligent on this subject? You want a lesson in racism? Watch an episode of South Park. Or if you want some hard sobering facts check out Richard Lynn's controversial studies on the subject. The fact that he is despised both by bleedingheart liberals and the extreme Right should be a recommendation in itself.The positive sides are that the film isn't boring and I enjoyed the rap is crap dialog. Also there is at least a hint that blacks can be just as bigoted as anyone else which shows that even Hollywood can occasionally wake up and smell the roses. The soundtrack is good  it was just placed in the wrong movie. It evokes scenes from The Lord Of The Rings trilogy i.e. doesn't fit with L.A. or racism or any of that.If you enjoyed other crappy Oscar movies there is no reason you shouldn't enjoy yet more Oscarwinning nonsense.

	schema:reviewBody "Take the popcultured infused sociopolitical discourse of a Spike Lee movie the glossy grit of a Michael Mann LA crime story and the compelling mosaic storytelling technique of a Paul Thomas Anderson film and you'll get the feel for Paul Haggis' stunning directorial debut. To boil a film like Crash down to such terms however would do it severe injustice. Powerful and thought provoking this is the most accomplished and compelling film since 21 Grams premiered back at the end of 2003.Crash brilliantly shows through intertwining vignettes that are often blazingly funny in their brutal honesty and fascinatingly gutwrenching in their melodrama how subtle racism often guised in nervous humor and overt prejudice often exasperated by sudden irrational violence and an overabundance of readily available firearms completely permeate our culture and everyday interactions within society. A hyper intelligent script showcases not characters but brilliant representations of real people people we know and pass in the street every day people not unlike us. People who at first seem to be lost causes in the war against racism witnessed in Matt Dillon's harried beat cop and Sandra Bulluck's spoiled District Attorney's wife can often become the most unlikely solutions to the problem while people who ride in on their high horse witnessed in Ryan Phillipe's noble young police officer can turn against the tide in the blink of an eye. No one is immune to it no matter how hard they try to rise above it witnessed in Don Cheadle's quietly tragic detective.In the end everyone is flawed the racism is inescapable and the audience feels a twinge of sympathy for just about everyone. Perhaps that is what Haggis is hinting at to be our answer. Showing empathy and being able to relate even on the most remote level to every human being out there is the first step to that true brotherhood of man. Because the film offers no real solution the discussion and discourse it creates in the minds of the viewers is the first step in solving society's ills. We can't tackle everything at once but we can open a dialogue and hopefully one person conversing with another will be the first step to our salvation. It takes a bold film to raise such questions and an even greater one to compel an audience to talk about the potential answers and that is exactly what Crash accomplishes.".

	schema:headline " Wacky Comedy about La La Land";
	schema:reviewBody "And I mean to say it's about a fantasy world. I've never been to LA but I can't believe a major metropolis like the one in this movie exists in this universe or even in an evil parallel universe. The reason I describe it as a comedy is that it became that for me. Because very early in the film there are several moments that are so nonsensical that it kept taking me out of the movie. And once you begin to look at this movie sideways the whole thing becomes funny.The first instance that I'm speaking about involves Brendan Fraser's character. By the way there is no way I'm going to use the character names because you don't get to know them enough to ever remember them. At best this movie is a '100 most racially motivated moments' countdown. So Brendan is some kind of politician and he's speaking to his handlers about how to spin something that has happened to him. He makes a suggestion and within the same minute finds that it is a bad suggestion and tells his underling to 'give himself a raise for that one' as if he wasn't the one who made the suggestion in the first place. No one does that. Bosses blame their workers for all kinds of mistakes that they make but not something that he just said within the same minute. I must have missed the next 3 lines of dialogue because I was thinking about how silly that was.Later there is a scene with Matt Dillon and Loretta Divine. I've seen bits and pieces of it on TV shows as a promotional clip. In context it's awful. Matt is being very friendly with her as he's hoping to find a solution with her to his father's medicalinsurance problems. And then he suddenly turns on a dime and starts spouting his issues with Affirmative Action. I'm not even sure if he took a breath. Nobody does that. Ever.Ludicrous and Larenz Tate. First off Larenz Tate is one of the better journeyman actors in this movie and the fact that he had to take a role where he basically plays sounding board meant solely to respond to Ludicrous who up until now has been a rap artist and to eventually be a bull'seye makes me sad. After being in the business for as long as he has he should have the Ludicrous role. But he didn't have the instant fanbase that Ludicrous has I guess. So anyway the Chinaman under the car. What was that? Chinaman sounds like a superhero who saves expensive dishware. That scene played as though it was meant to be comedic. Scary.It all ended for me with the scene involving Don Cheadle and William Fichtner. Fichtner begins and ends a conversation with Don Cheadle with the question expletive black people huh? Yes that expletive. And from there on in I couldn't stop laughing. No one talks like that. Ever. I don't know how he got it out. He knows he'd never say that to a black person. And he knows he's never met anyone who would do that. And between the bookend questions he used the word black about 89 times. Ridiculous. One day in the future Don Cheadle is going to sit down and watch this movie and see how racist it really is. Not that it's showing us racist people that it is racist. So then wackiness ensues as Terrence Howard winds up in a car chase and does probably the stupidest thing any character in any movie has ever done when he gets out of the car packing a gun and screaming insanities at a cop who is trying to stop him from getting shot. None of that makes any sense either but the moment when I fell out of my chair involves a Persian guy who hates buying doors and a little girl with a magic cloak. Remember in Pulp Fiction when God changed Coke to Pepsi? Well He's up to His Old Tricks again. Which I guess was an attempt to make the most predictable shooting in movie history unpredictable at the last minute. Awful.The piece de resistance. When that women started running into the hospital screaming Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui! I thought to myself oh please let 'Chinaman' be her husband Larenz Tate being Don Cheadle's baby brother wasn't poetic enough Wouldn't you know it? The gods of cinema fulfilled my request. tear And the best part? Her name was Kim Lee. KIM LEE. Amazing.This movie was bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. I did my best to give it a fair shake but it wouldn't let me. It was unrealistic the dialogue was atrocious and a lot of the acting was sub par. And the final scenes were blatantly mooning the makers of Magnolia. Saying Look we made a really bad version of your movie and we're going to prove how unoriginal we are by doing our own sad version of the Wise Up scene but to play off that we're not our actors won't sing. P And the best part is we attached racism to it so it'll get all kinds of praise it doesn't deserve. As I said before at the very best it's a wacky comedy at the very worst it's Best Picture as deemed by AMPAS. I don't know what they were thinking if they were thinking. All I can do is laugh about the whole thing. But I do recommend that everyone see it just to have their own opinion of it. I would never expect anyone to believe a review this onesided so please see it for yourself. But I promise you these were my honest thoughts while watching this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "And I mean to say it's about a fantasy world. I've never been to LA but I can't believe a major metropolis like the one in this movie exists in this universe or even in an evil parallel universe. The reason I describe it as a comedy is that it became that for me. Because very early in the film there are several moments that are so nonsensical that it kept taking me out of the movie. And once you begin to look at this movie sideways the whole thing becomes funny.The first instance that I'm speaking about involves Brendan Fraser's character. By the way there is no way I'm going to use the character names because you don't get to know them enough to ever remember them. At best this movie is a '100 most racially motivated moments' countdown. So Brendan is some kind of politician and he's speaking to his handlers about how to spin something that has happened to him. He makes a suggestion and within the same minute finds that it is a bad suggestion and tells his underling to 'give himself a raise for that one' as if he wasn't the one who made the suggestion in the first place. No one does that. Bosses blame their workers for all kinds of mistakes that they make but not something that he just said within the same minute. I must have missed the next 3 lines of dialogue because I was thinking about how silly that was.Later there is a scene with Matt Dillon and Loretta Divine. I've seen bits and pieces of it on TV shows as a promotional clip. In context it's awful. Matt is being very friendly with her as he's hoping to find a solution with her to his father's medicalinsurance problems. And then he suddenly turns on a dime and starts spouting his issues with Affirmative Action. I'm not even sure if he took a breath. Nobody does that. Ever.Ludicrous and Larenz Tate.

Matt Dillon's character has been played a million times a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie. The predictability hardly ended with those characters. A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. The morals of the story were PC to the max. There were a few clever twists but not nearly enough.

I reject both the suggested idea that I have no idea who I am and the inferred suggestion that this film tells me who people truly are. If people in real life are really like this then man we're screwed.A bilious film that I walked into late and left prematurely. A film which is so wrapped up in its goal of becoming The Race Film of All Time that it loses sight of the very tools a film must use.The rules of Hollywood are such if you show something in the first half it must be used in the second half. Thus the gun that the daughter worries about her father buying will somehow find its way into the story in the second half. The rules of Hollywood are to make dialog 'real'  a concept which changes with every decade. Is this 'real dialog' somehow less ludicrous than the 'real dialog' of Kevin Smith ten years ago? The rules of Hollywood state that we set the scene and as action rises the camera moves in closer to the faces  in this film primarily so we can see the supposed shame humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters. The strings increase the framerate slows down and our heart is meant to break.This film is as crassly manipulative as it is vapid. I have my own prejudices against L.A. which I freely admit so to combat this prejudice I will not say that this is a natural situation stemming from the location but rather probably from the author and director. The writer Paul Haggis already showed a taste for polemics over humanity in his Million Dollar Baby which at least had a director who understood how to make the vision of the film bring out the best of a script's ideas. Now that Paul Haggis has his own hands on the camera it becomes obvious that not only does he not know how to write true natural human drama he does not know how to photograph or direct it as well. Paul Haggis comes from the land of TV let us not forget the land of diminished expectations.Everything is as obvious as a TVmovie simply presented for simple minds  Haggis drills into us over and over again that while on the surface people may seem to be awful they have secret pains hidden. This is a nice idea but so hamfistedly presented that the whole juxtaposition of badgood has an amateurish feel. Structurally the film is broken up in the tradition of Magnolia and other earlier films. The editing is as typical and conventionally cinematic as could be  if there is a dramatic movement such as a door opening or a car driving past between the subject and camera the editors use that extreme movement to give the cut that occurs there a more kinetic quality. The problem is that other than the drive to keep things moving there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts  everything is kept by the books. Not only are the puppets of this hideous racial punch and judy show ineptly handled but even the curtains are lowered and raised with incompetence.The film tries desperately to present reality but there's just no talent whatsoever. Some of the actors are good some of the actors are bad and all of the performance get muddied together brought down by the low low aesthetics of the film. We have cinematography which is technically clear we can see the scene we have a clear understanding of what is happening. However not only is the cinematography unremarkable but it is thoughtless camerawork and framing which believes that it actually is inspired. The result is little stylistic flourishes which one recognizes but do not actually add anything to the drama or pathos. For example  and this is a spoiler  as a father holds his dying child the father might be shot too I didn't stick around to find out the camera sees his face and gives us the famous Vertigo trackzoom. The Vertigo shot!!! It was at this point that the film became hysterical and I just had to leave. I had to leave because it was so bad. I left because I was in the middle of a crowded theater and I wanted to express to the audience that I was sick of emptyheaded Hollywood 'art' which is full of sound and fury yet signifying nothing in the Bard's own words. I hate to waste such good Shakespearian references on something this remarkably bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't the least bit impressed by Crash. It's a film that tackles an important subject racism but it's a film that tackles it with twodimensional characters contrivances and sentimentality. In the end all it says is that we're all prejudiced in our own way and that prejudice is bad. Well to anyone with half a brain that's hardly a revelation but although the message is a little obvious and pap I would be happy to embrace the film if it were well written and well directed but it's not.What disappointed me most about the film was the way the characters weren't characters but mouthpieces instead. It's like Paul Haggis has culled every different opinion and view on race and shoehorned it into his film. At no point does it feel organic. At no point do the people seem like people expressing themselves freely. They always sound like they're reading a magazine article that someone is putting words in their mouth. Of course this is the case but good film writing is when you completely forget there's a script.The worst culprits are the two black carjackers. All they do is discuss the prejudices they face. Sure this may be a subject close to their hearts but I find it hard to accept that they wouldn't talk about anything else. And yes you may scream that that is what the film is about prejudice but I've always thought it much more effective to tackle subjects through themes rather than have the characters rant about the issue at hand for a couple of hours like they were on Question Time. But then again subtlety isn't a thing this film is endowed with.Having said that though I do admire the film for at least having a go at tackling racism in an evenhanded way. It's a film that acknowledges that racism isn't the sole preserve of whites that dogooders do as much harm as bigots and that we're all partly to blame for the current mess. But although these things are touched upon none of them is investigated in any depth. The film takes a scattershot approach to its subject rendering it unsatisfactory.The most interesting segment is the one to do with Don Cheadle's investigation into a shooting involving two policemen. It touches on political spin the way that shortsighted idiots want to promote people not for their individual merits but for their political value and the way that pussyfooting around on the issue of race has a negative effect on everyone. But while I think this would make a very interesting film all on it's own and one that would make more profound comments on race it's just a brief portion of the film.Conversely you have a pretty poor segment focusing on an Iranian shopkeeper. The man is like Basil Fawlty without the laughs. He's a complete knob who spends his time ranting and raving and behaving obnoxiously. And he even gets so irate that he tries to kill a Hispanic man who he thinks cheated him the Hispanic man is the complete opposite of the shopkeeper  he's so saintly it defies belief. But this leads to a syrupy scene where the Hispanic man's daughter intervenes bathed in ethereal light and accompanied by twinkly music and inadvertently allows the shopkeeper to rethink his worldview.And that's another thing that's wrong with the film. All the prejudiced characters in the film have their beliefs adjusted through tumultuous events. I know the film's called Crash and Cheadle at the start says that people are disconnected and only change their views when they collide with other people but it's not really true. Yeah a traumatic event can change your outlook on life but people's prejudices are more often eroded through time and experience. So while I can accept people changing their views when they crash into other people it just seems silly when it occurs multiple times like it does in this film. And the way it happens too doesn't help.I've already mentioned the scene with the shopkeeper but the scene where Bullock embraces her Mexican housekeeper and says that she's her best friend is about as subtle as Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier linking fingers in The Defiant Ones and Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder singing 'Ebony and Ivory'. And then there's the final scene itself. The sassy black car thief frees some Thai people. Wonderful you may think. He's discovered his humanity. But aside from the fact that the scene is saccharine in the extreme it also makes no sense logically. He frees a bunch of people who can't speak English and who have no money oh he gives them 40. They're going to have a good time aren't they? They can look forward to living on the streets being spit upon by people in SUVs and if they're lucky they might get a job washing dishes. It's the American dream baby. But then to make the ending even worse right at the final moment there's another crash and more racial anger. You see what's the director is saying? The cycle continues. Wow it's a revelation! But the thing that infuriated me the most was the idiotic scene where Phillippee shoots Cheadle's brother in his car. It was ridiculous. Philippee picks the bloke up they behave like children and wind each other up and then in a tragic mixup Cheadle's brother gets killed. The scene is one big contrivance. The director needs a sting in the tail to again prove that the cycle continues so you have a big coincidence an unbelievable argument and a shooting. Yes the races are still uneasy together yes they're still suspicious and yes the consequences can sometimes be tragic but by trying to cover all the bases and all the arguments Haggis spreads himself far too thin. Better to do one thing well than lots of things poorly.".

Well if CRASH were indeed accurate with respect to its depiction of race relations in Los Angeles with which the Academy voters seem to agree then I sure am glad I live in New York City.Extremely didactic and bombastic CRASH has reduced racial politics into diluted mind numbing stereotypes and extremely broadly written characters that are nothing more than caricatures. CRASH takes the easy way out does not and indeed cannot with its large number of players on its canvas delve into character complexities or at least try to mimic if not actually depict the way real people deal with racism. Among its embarrassment of extremely unrealistic scenes and the film is replete with them a rich wellmannered white woman of the noblesse oblige variety hurled insults at a Latino locksmith who is changing the lock of her front door and within his earshot accused him of planning to sell the key as soon as he gets the opportunity to do so. What instead would have been realistic was for this character to express her concerns to her white husband a couple of rooms away in their large luxury home with no one else in the room.Such white woman is somehow redeemable from this faux pas with the Latino locksmith because cheap redemptions abound in this movie this rich white woman later slips down the stairs and lo and behold the only one who tended to her injuries was her Latina maid. And just like that the rich white woman declared that her Latina maid whose services were paid for by her and her husband was her best friend. Presto! Her earlier treatment of the locksmith is forgiven.The film also places up front and center a white racist cop who also happens to be his father's caretaker. He treats black people like 3rd class citizens but Paul Haggis would almost make it seem that this character's racist attitudes were balanced out by his having to care for his father. I would further argue that Haggis posits that racism is excusable when one has other personal concerns in his or her life and that is simply indefensible. Racism cannot be excused by one's family duties no matter how overwhelming they may be. And as with the white woman mentioned above a cheap redemption also awaits this white racist cop. A black woman he earlier molests in front of her black husband is caught in a car about to explode. And who comes to this woman's rescue well it's none other than this racistmolesting cop! And at the end of this sequence we are supposed to feel sympathy for this cop when arguably it is a combination of his duty as a cop as well as his instinct of selfpreservation after all he was in the car that was about to explode with the black woman he earlier molested that truly motivated his heroic efforts.Racism is not reducible to mere black and white. Racist cops are nothing novel just recall the Rodney King case the Abner Louima scandal and the Amadou Diallo news stories. Racism in the real world or at least the world that is outside the bubble that is Los Angeles however festers beneath the surface is much more subtle and covert. It's when I used to walk around the malls as a teenager and was constantly followed by the security guards and sales staff asking me if I needed assistance while white kids roamed about the store free from the prying eyes and intrusive conduct of store management. They are comments passed seemingly innocuously by people who tell me that they could never tell between Japanese Chinese Filipinos and other Southeast Asians because they all look the same. It's when people assume that no black person who works as a secretary or receptionist could ever speak nonbroken English.And subtleties like these are what CRASH is glaringly missing. In this day and age if there is one thing we do with respect to this most sensitive of topics we DO NOT vocalize our misconceptionsbeliefs toward certain races and minorities absent heated confrontations or inebriatedaltered states and more importantly shout out these beliefs within the presence or earshot of members of the aforementioned groups.CRASH would have us believe that everyone walks around so wound up and ready to lash out a racial epithet to anyone and everyone whose skin color andor cultural background happen to be different from yours be it your girlfriend someone you got into a car accident with your hired help and policemen in the guise of performing their civic and professional duties. And if Haggis really wanted to portray duality in that everyone has good and bad within them then why did he carve out exceptions for Asians as exemplified by the film's Asian male character and his wife who the film deemed as the ONLY irredeemable characters in the its throughline? CRASH has dumbed down racism to the point that if someone tells me they feel like they learned something about themselves from viewing the film I feel nothing but pity for them because they obviously have not experienced racism and they either live in an extremely homogeneous society or not in the real world at all. There is nothing novel about CRASH and there are no lessons to be learned from it that are not selfevident when one just steps outside one's home.CRASH fails in every way possible to show accurately racism and the true evil it is. Racism is complicated and for a project this ambitious CRASH should not have been rewarded with the Best Picture Oscar especially when it failed in all respectsartistically technically and otherwisefrom achieving its admittedly lofty goals.".
