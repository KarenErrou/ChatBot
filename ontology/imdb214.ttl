I have to say another thing about this movie Actors well... the people that are supposed to be Actors are not the only ones who failed.

But leaving Jack alive was a grave mistake because after getting better his saddles up and goes for bloody revenge.I usually prefer Italian westerns to those from the US because most of the latter are too tame for my tastes. There is a nastiness about BLACK JACK that is quite powerful and disturbing. Even on the used VHS the cinematography was great and the same has to be said about the effective score. The acting is good for this kind of film though Jack's grief and madness sometimes border on the comical  especially when he bursts out laughing like a loon during one fight. Still this is powerful and effective cinema and should be of interest to anyone who likes the genre or revenge films in general. It's a pity that the film is near impossible to find at the time of this writing. I hope it will get a DVD release soon. This 35 year old gem is overdue for rediscovery.".

The premise is quite good as the theme of vengeance has often been exploited in these films making it look something much safer and more positive than it actually is. Margheriti's film Vengeance is interesting but never manages to express anything worthwhile about revenge and its possible results. Hossein's Cemetery Without Crosses has a great potential and characters but ends up in rather typical and unsatisfying ending albeit the film being very interesting visually scripted by Dario Argento.Black Jack has several intense and disturbing moments and the storytelling is very effective making the 90 minutes pass incredibly fast. There are some segments of fantastic photography in the desert some poetic images of irreversible violence mostly the thickening flame on front of the picture which all make the film little closer to the masterpiece of spaghetti western Il grande silenzio by Sergio Corbucci and from the same year. Black Jack certainly doesn't show violence in a good or positive light unlike Fulci's Four of the Apocalypse for example and it must be said it hasn't lost much of its power during these years. Some infamous and shocking westerns like Cutthroarts Nine Joaquim Luis Romero Marchent seem rather pathetic in front of these much more visual also mentally violent and effective works of the genre.".

There isn't a single boring moment in this movie.The acting from all the cast members is above average for a Eurowestern. I especially like Robert Woods's maniacal laughing as he torments the victims of his vengeance. It's a nice touch definitely the kind of thing that makes these Eurowesterns so fun to watch.Lallo Gori's music score is fantastic. It has a style all its own and manages to sound great without trying to imitate Morricone. The organ music parts are especially cool.There is even a little touch of Poe at the end as the buildings begin to crumble around the tragic characters.I really can't say enough about this movie without giving too much away so see it for yourself if you can find it!".

	schema:reviewBody "BLACK JACK is a dark dark example of the spaghetti western replacing the usual light comedy found in these films with an almost vicious streak of violence which while not explicit still hits the mark. No doubt it was made as a result of DJANGO and the writer's efforts to go one step further in delivering a nihilistic storyline.Robert Woods plays an effective character as the leader of a group of thieves pulling off a big robbery. All goes according to plan until the inevitable 'thieves fall out' aftermath in which he's betrayed and left for dead by the bad guys who also rape murder and scalp ! his sister for good measure. Woods survives albeit in a crippled form and goes on a mission of vengeance against his former allies tackling them one at a time.It's a simplistic plot but one that supports a film with a good visual style including touches of Poe no less here and there especially at the Roger CormanPoe cycle inspired climax. The violent scenes are well directed and Woods plays a memorable character dressed all in black and limping difficultly across the screen. BLACK JACK isn't what I'd call a classic but spaghetti western fans are well advised to seek it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have found that spaghetti westerns that chose to film in Israel instead of the usual stomping grounds of Spain tend to have some very interesting touches to them even if they don't work overall. But Black Jack is one example that works very well for the most part. It is an incredibly dark and bleak spaghetti western in many aspects not just with the amoral bad guys but also with a hero who doesn't seem to be any better than the men he hunts down in a quest for revenge. The scenes of revenge are very memorable having violence and brutality that will make viewers wince at least a little. Even when the movie is not showcasing violence or revenge the atmosphere is dripping with dread in part due to the dusty and haunting Israeli desert backdrop. Robert Woods acts appropriately meanspirited for the most part though he does overact a few times when his character gets into a bout of insane laughter. Another quibble is that the movie takes a long time almost half of the running time as a matter of fact to set everything up before Woods starts on his path of vengeance. And the pacing does remain kind of slow at times in the second half of the movie. Also it's not made clear how Woods' character manages to track down his former criminal partners. But those minor shortcomings should not prevent spaghetti western fans from enjoying this western. Though considering the REALLY harsh tone of the movie maybe I should pick a better word than enjoying.Note Watch the movie on YouTube instead of DVD because as one other IMDb user pointed out earlier the ending on the DVD has been edited in a way to be pretty incomprehensible.".

	schema:headline " An entertaining and touching seriocomic tale";
	schema:reviewBody "My main reason for checking this movie out was because of Robin Williams. After seeing him in so many great films like Insomnia and One Hour Photo and watching his numerous hilarious talk show appearances I've become even more curious about checking out the movies on his filmography that I have yet to see.  Well this is more than just a Robin Williams vehicle.  Paul Mazursky cleverly combines comedy and drama and expresses some good morals. He accurately portrays an immigrant's journey to America and how heshe expects that America is a beautiful place where everyone can run free without any set limitations.  It starts out as a fishoutofwater comedy in which Russian immigrant Williams who decides he wants to become an American citizen explores the oddities of New York City and revels in its ambience no matter how rough the neighborhoods are no matter how many wackos are running around.  Then he slowly learns that freedom has a price.  America may be a free country but that doesn't stop him from getting mugged and having his upstairs neighbors constantly complain about him playing his saxophone.  One thing that impressed me was rather than have a bunch of American actors don Russian accents Mazursky actually has the actors speaking Russian to each other.  Now there are certain movies like Schindler's List and K19  The Widowmaker in which we do see American actors speaking English and putting on foreign accents and still prove to be good movies but it's always more engaging to see characters from a certain country speaking their native language.  I mean what if Russia were to make a movie set in America where all the American characters were speaking Russian in American accents?  How goofy would that look?  I'm guessing that Williams was the only American actor in the cast and the rest are actual Russians.  I don't speak Russian so I can't tell whether or not Williams was actually speaking Russian but it looked convincing to me.  But since mainstream American audiences have grown to hate reading subtitles you probably won't see a movie like this released nationwide.  Robin Williams gives a terrific performance totally disappearing into character.  I was actually convinced he was a foreigner as he speaks just like a Russian immigrant in broken English not articulating his words one bit.  There was no sign of Robin Williams the Comedian in his character. Whenever he gets a laugh he gets a laugh as Vladimir and not as Robin. Besides this is one of his more serious roles and he never really plays it for laughs.  Maria Conchita Alonso still sounds Cuban as her Italian character but she still gives a fine performance.  Since I haven't seen her in any recent movies it's nice to see her pretty face again.  She was like the Salma Hayek of the 80's.  Williams and Alonso have a good onscreen chemistry.  The friendship between Williams and his AfricanAmerican friend who goes as far as letting him move in with his family is very touching.  Working as a security guard at Bloomingdale's and seeing Williams wreaking havoc around the store he starts out hating his guts.  Before you know it they're best buddies.  The most touching scene is the one in which Williams leaves a jazz club depressed after being told by a wellknown jazz musician that he needs practice.  He decides to throw his saxophone away and forget about being a musician altogether.  His friend relates to his problem and gives him plenty of encouragement in pursuing his dream of playing the saxophone as they get drunk and laugh their heads off.  The movie stresses the outburst of immigrants in New York City which is a melting pot society.  Almost every character Williams comes in contact with is either a foreigner or a minority.  Strange but undoubtedly true if you were to examine the streets of New York.  It's not unlikely to walk across a whole city block where not one person speaks English.  The movie has no real plot structure as it is mainly characterdriven.  The comedy is subtle and arises naturally.  My favorite quote from the film is when Williams says I bought my first pair of American shoes.  They were made in Italy.  That is a sample of the kind of humor in this film.  I definitely suggest people check out this oldiebutagoodie. My score  7 out of 10".

Now there are certain movies like Schindler's List and K19  The Widowmaker in which we do see American actors speaking English and putting on foreign accents and still prove to be good movies but it's always more engaging to see characters from a certain country speaking their native language.  I mean what if Russia were to make a movie set in America where all the American characters were speaking Russian in American accents?  How goofy would that look?  I'm guessing that Williams was the only American actor in the cast and the rest are actual Russians.  I don't speak Russian so I can't tell whether or not Williams was actually speaking Russian but it looked convincing to me.  But since mainstream American audiences have grown to hate reading subtitles you probably won't see a movie like this released nationwide.  Robin Williams gives a terrific performance totally disappearing into character.  I was actually convinced he was a foreigner as he speaks just like a Russian immigrant in broken English not articulating his words one bit.  There was no sign of Robin Williams the Comedian in his character. Whenever he gets a laugh he gets a laugh as Vladimir and not as Robin. Besides this is one of his more serious roles and he never really plays it for laughs.  Maria Conchita Alonso still sounds Cuban as her Italian character but she still gives a fine performance.  Since I haven't seen her in any recent movies it's nice to see her pretty face again.  She was like the Salma Hayek of the 80's.  Williams and Alonso have a good onscreen chemistry.  The friendship between Williams and his AfricanAmerican friend who goes as far as letting him move in with his family is very touching.  Working as a security guard at Bloomingdale's and seeing Williams wreaking havoc around the store he starts out hating his guts.  Before you know it they're best buddies.  The most touching scene is the one in which Williams leaves a jazz club depressed after being told by a wellknown jazz musician that he needs practice.  He decides to throw his saxophone away and forget about being a musician altogether.  His friend relates to his problem and gives him plenty of encouragement in pursuing his dream of playing the saxophone as they get drunk and laugh their heads off.  The movie stresses the outburst of immigrants in New York City which is a melting pot society.  Almost every character Williams comes in contact with is either a foreigner or a minority.  Strange but undoubtedly true if you were to examine the streets of New York.  It's not unlikely to walk across a whole city block where not one person speaks English.  The movie has no real plot structure as it is mainly characterdriven.  The comedy is subtle and arises naturally.  My favorite quote from the film is when Williams says I bought my first pair of American shoes.  They were made in Italy.  That is a sample of the kind of humor in this film.  I definitely suggest people check out this oldiebutagoodie. My score  7 out of 10";

Noteworthy performances by Maria Conchita Alonso as his eventual girlfriend and Cleavant Derricks as the Bloomingdales security guard who takes an immediate liking to Vladimir. Mazursky walks the line of schmaltz at times but doesn't cross over. Especially evident in a well done scene when Vladimir finds out about the death of his beloved grandfather.

The rest of the film deals with his attempts to settle in the US.Obviously given the great political changes in the USSR and Eastern Europe since the film was released it has aged noticeably. However it is not entirely without merit. The big plus is obviously Robin Williams. He was and is a great actor and seems to have put in great effort on his Russian and spoken English accents. Notice the way he says Mister. The hot hot hot Maria Conchita Gonzalez Miss Venezuela 1971 plays an Italian immigrant and the love interest. The overall bent of the film is liberal  AfricanAmerican families are especially realistically and positively portrayed. The central lesson of the film is that the transition from a Communist to a Capitalist mentality is not easy and the adjustment can bring great joy and sorrow. That is a very valid lesson in the largest context of the later collapse of the USSR and the painful transition exSoviet states are still going through.".

	schema:reviewBody "Moscow on the Hudson is a fabulous example of a prettygood movie chock full of 1980s artifacts like Jordache jeans feathered hairdos and Afro Sheen that is often surprisingly interesting sensitive and even occasionally profound  especially on the level of the victory of the individual soul over totalitarianism and the defense of American capitalism against Marxism.This film brings back a flood of cultural memories of the Eighties the decade immediately preceding the collapse of the Soviet Union a time in the United States when our political and cultural selfesteem matched our economic prosperity. It doesn't hurt that this movie stars a young bearded Robin Williams with heart and Russian soul! and a really cute and occasionally nude young Maria Conchita Alonso a reallife Venezuelan immigrant full of Italian passion and an ambitious independent spirit.Only in the early 1980s could blue jeans from Bloomies velvety white toilet paper supermarket coffee studio apartments hotdog stands cabdriving jobs and U.S. citizenship ceremonies be portrayed as symbols  indeed even weapons  of democratic capitalism in a world still governed from Stettin on the Baltic to Varna on the Black Sea by the totalitarian evil against which President Ronald Reagan called a crusade two years earlier in his famous 1982 Evil Empire speech to the House of Commons.The political content of the movie is startlingly blackandwhite by today's standards of multiculturalism and moral relativism when many academics defend dictatorships' sovereign right to exist and so the offhand manner with which at every turn the film's writers Paul Mazursky and Leon Capetanos deliver praise to political liberty capitalism and America's unique cultural acceptance of immigrants dedicated to the pursuit of happiness is remarkable. While the way in which their praises are conveyed may from timetotime seem a little cheesy sentimental or dated their profound significance is not diminished.Exactly because capitalism is an economic system as well as a social system Robin William's character is portrayed as a Russian seeking a remedy for his literal physical hunger and basic financial requirements of life that socialism fails to satisfy. His Russian friend played wonderfully by Elya Baskin suffers from socialism's other often dramatized evil  its humiliating and paralyzing effect on an individual's creative mind and psychology. Perhaps it is precisely because the film's focus is on Williams' character that Moscow on the Hudson at times comes off as exhibiting the overthetop 1980s commercialism that made it popular then and a little startling in today's Greener age.Russophiles can get a kick out of some of the Russia scenes. Highlights include the drab Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoi Boulevard including fullfigured women in polyester sour old babushkas enforcing their place in line and shoe vendors pushing the wrong sizes. They might also find some treatment of Soviet atrocities like sending war protesters to mental institutions or neighbors reporting dissidents to the KGB a bit trite but not inaccurate. Such horrors are no less relevant in Putin's Russia of today October 2006 where the most recent contract killing of independent politicians businessmen and intellectuals is journalist Anna Politkovskaya.While I've focused on the political content this movie is not primarily a political piece but a love story and not primarily a love story but a romance of personal initiative  of immigrants who choose to reject the oppressive circumstances they left behind and to seize the chance to pursue their material survival and eventually individual happiness. The aims of the film are high maybe even too high at times for this light film to be able to achieve fully but it is definitely touching and fairly deals with the array of issues every immigrant faces on a variety of levels. I personally found the love relationship between Williams and Alonso to be touchingly realistic at times and the individualistic focus of this film to be refreshing as well as a shocking reminder of how inappropriately selfconscious the American media has become in publicly asserting the universal truth and appeal of its core principles freedom and capitalism.".

If you are an American watching it there is no place like home.Vladimir Ivanoff Robin Williams is a saxophonist with a Russian circus in the days of the bad old Soviet Union. Tired of waiting in line for toilet paper and bribing a snooping KGB agent Saveli Kramarov with shoes that won't fit him anyway Vlad has a catharsis somewhere between Estee Lauder and Pierre Cardin in a Manhattan Bloomie's and decides to defect. America means freedom but will it mean happiness too?Have you ever felt like just not talking? asks Vlad's new girlfriend Lucia Maria Conchita Alonso.In Russia that's permanent way of life answers Vlad.Moscow On The Hudson is another of those superlative Paul Mazursky films that was a hit in its day and has been ignored since. Mazursky's films play off the contrast between the fantastic and everyday reality. The early scenes of Vlad in Moscow feature a chilly brittle environment of little humor with Williams scoring points not for being a cutup but for being so muted and beatendown. It's so gray it feels at times like a Bergman film with welcome clownish notes struck not by Williams but Elya Baskin as his friend whose dream becomes Vlad's reality.Then we get the trip to New York a wondrous place where you can do anything in this country if you want but everybody I meet is from somewhere else. A suddenly vibrant color scheme is married to a sometimes goofy sense of humor yet a sense of menace and despair hangs over all. There are goofy scenes moments of humor that don't quite work yet Williams' performance remains balanced and straightforwardly characterdriven throughout. No shtick here.Most of the time the film is too busy celebrating the idea of America as the land of immigrants. Mazursky isn't making Yankee Doodle Dandy here. He may be celebrating the United States but not blindly. Our first shot of New York is of Abraham Lincoln on a billboard wearing oversized earphones with the legend Not all stereophones are created equal. Not all people either. The black family who adopts Vlad early on makes do with a breakfast of Cocoa Puffs and no work in sight.But Mazursky keeps things merry with an eye toward opportunity and strength through diversity. Even when he leans too far in search of a shot it still brings a chill like when group of immigrants recite their oath of American allegiance or an old Asian guy lifts a sparkler up to the Empire State Building in celebration of the Fourth of July.It was easy to love America in films of the 1940s and 1950s but by 1984 you needed to work a little harder at it. Moscow On The Hudson doesn't softsoap Vladimir's struggle or sell it as a political act I'm not political are the first words out of his mouth after his defection is made clear. But it celebrates the idea of America with a vibrancy and courage few films have shown since and more interestingly does so from what Roger Ebert noted was a liberal point of view. Liberal but with a strong capitalist touch back in the day when the two ideas were still compatible.Maybe they still are. You can still watch this on Amazon.com can't you?".

Even when he leans too far in search of a shot it still brings a chill like when group of immigrants recite their oath of American allegiance or an old Asian guy lifts a sparkler up to the Empire State Building in celebration of the Fourth of July.It was easy to love America in films of the 1940s and 1950s but by 1984 you needed to work a little harder at it. Moscow On The Hudson doesn't softsoap Vladimir's struggle or sell it as a political act I'm not political are the first words out of his mouth after his defection is made clear. But it celebrates the idea of America with a vibrancy and courage few films have shown since and more interestingly does so from what Roger Ebert noted was a liberal point of view. Liberal but with a strong capitalist touch back in the day when the two ideas were still compatible.Maybe they still are. You can still watch this on Amazon.com can't you?";

	schema:headline " Good Concept Falls A Bit Short";
	schema:reviewBody "I found that I had to think a bit about this movie to really begin to appreciate it. The initial response I had was to treat it as a mildly amusing comedy revolving around an eclectic set of characters that didn't really seem to have much of a point in the end. But there's more going on here than meets the eye at first. The whole movie revolves around the concept of freedom and how freedom is defined. Produced at the height of the Cold War I took from this movie a statement that freedom is about much more than a political system.The first part of the movie deals with Vladimir Ivanoff's Robin Williams life in the Soviet Union. Protesters are arrested Ivanoff is threatened by the KGB for no reason other than that he has an eccentric grandfather and people line up for blocks to buy toilet paper or shoes that don't fit. From what I've read that's probably an accurate description of life in the USSR. But it isn't as bleak as it seems. Ivanoff has a family he loves a girlfriend who loves him and wants to get married and he can pursue his passion of saxophone playing with the Circus. Most important  this guy doesn't want to defect and he tries to convince his best friend Anatoly Elya Baskin not to defect either when the Circus visits New York City.The second part of the movie is set in New York. On the spur of the moment Vladimir defects  at Bloomingdale's. He hadn't planned to. It just happened. Asked by an FBI agent why he was defecting he answered simply freedom. And now we begin to learn about freedom. Vladimir tries to make connections. His best friend becomes a black store security guard named Lionel Cleavant Derricks. Lionel's family parallels Vladimir's right down to the eccentric grandfather but it isn't Vladimir's family. Lucia Maria Conchita Alonso becomes Vladimir's love interest but she doesn't want to commit. He can't even play the sax. He waits tables drives a taxi becomes a street hawker  all ultimately unsatisfying. For me the most poignant part of the film comes in a coffee shop in a discussion among the various immigrants. They misquote the Declaration of Independence and say that the inalienable rights of human beings are life liberty and happiness. But Thomas Jefferson didn't say that. He said the pursuit of happiness. Here is where I really began to see the film as a sort of satire about freedom. To be politically free without having one's basic human needs met is ultimately not freedom.It's an interesting statement. Unfortunately the movie itself is not that interesting. That's the basic problem. It has the potential to be powerful but just doesn't rise to that potential. Why? Too much emphasis was put on the immigrant nature of New York City for one thing. That became  to me  something of a running joke and I started wondering what the next accent would be rather than following the story. For a movie that tries to make a powerful statement and a gutsy one given the political climate of the time it just came across as too light  the sort of movie that you feel you could miss twenty minutes of and step right back into without trouble. The nude scene with Maria Conchita Alonso in the bathtub with Robin Williams Williams hands roving all over her body also struck me as in bad taste and exploitative  totally unnecessary to the story.Anyway not bad. Once I took the time to think about it I decided to move it up a couple of notches in my estimation. 610. Unfortunately it could have been so much better.".

The movie is all Robin Williams it is an excellent showplace for his many talents. He is very much like Charlie Chaplin and Red Skelton in that they can be very funny and also very sad often at the same time. The movie is set in New York City but everyone is from somewhere else in the world all trying to make a new life there. Williams' character is very multilevel and rich. He is not merely a clown you really do get under his skin and understand his motives. The movie can strike some as sad in that Robin's character has a deep sense of melancholy about him from his days as an unhappy Russian musician to his days as a free american. We sense his deep sadness behind the laughs. Recommended if you are a fan of Robin Williams or just need a pickup. This would make a good Fourth Of July tradition movie to watch.".

This movie was still in the days when there was the naive and simple belief that America could be a great place. Robin Williams brilliantly portrays the Russian circus musician who ends up defecting. Williams plays Alexander with great sensitivity and humor. Russia is portrayed almost as it was. America is not perfect. The black store security guard he meets has a family that hasn't found work in years. Alexander has to work really hard to make a new life for himself. Still the movie had the Capraesquire belief that a new immigrant can find happiness in America. I am sad to say that those days are gone. The idea that he and his girlfriend can work it out and that Alexander can find success in life has been replaced by political correctness. Movies like Moscow On The Hudson remind us that the naive and simple days weren't really so bad. We definitely need to recapture that spirit again nowadays.".

This is minor though.Nest there are the toilet paper line scenes which are totally lame. We would use napkins or newspaper as toilet paper in SU but we didn't have the long lines do buy toilet paper as the movie claims to project.Then there's a reference to Russian women having a mustache which is totally ridiculous. Another piece of retarded coldwar American propaganda. Anyone who's been to the SU or Russia knows that Russian women are 10 20 no 100 times hotter than their American counterparts over 50 of which are statistically obese to say the least. Not to mention American women's attitude that has resulted in American men being the 1 men by country to marry foreign women. Enough said.In general each country the SU and the US had positives and negatives about living there. But life in the SU was superior after all I left SU only after it broke up in 1991. People in the SU had far more of the one precious resource that Americans could only dream of having and still do TIME. People in the SU had a roof over their head food and other basic necessities of life while at the same time having a ton of free time including time to pursue their dreams and hobbies. That is why the arts ballet literature etc. were so developed in the SU compared to the US people actually had time on their hands to pursue those interests and hobbies. The US was and still is a bunch of debt slaves that live thinking how to make enough money to pay the next set of their bills and have no time for real life.Not to mention that American kids grew up and do even more so now inside seeing nothing but virtual reality playing computer games etc. while we in the SU were free to play out in the street all day long without being worried about drugs psychos kidnappers etc. At age 10 I could take a train to a different city to go to a market to buy parts for building a personal computer for instance. Good luck doing that in the U.S. which doesn't even have a transportation system to this day. And I never heard about drugs until the SU broke up. Ultimately no society is perfect but a good part of this movie is just a bunch of cheap propaganda. Of course some people would defect from the SU but so did people from the States look up Dean Reed for instance.I liked the line I have not had a job for 8 years. Welcome to the USA! Sounds like things have not progressed much in the USA since 1984 when this movie was made....Anyway travel the world people and draw your own conclusions before you buy the bullsh!t that your government feeds you. Goes the same for both Russia and the U.S. as well as any other country... If you think of watching this flick opt for Goodwill Hunting instead even if it would be a rerun for you.".

Vladimir the Russian main character is completely different from any Russian I ever actually met although it can work since all individuals are different. Convinced Marxists will hate its all too truthful criticism of communism. The 2  sex scenes break up the movies otherwise family friendly tone. However in spite of these details which can be both pluses and minuses depending on ones point of view Moscow on the Hudson is a great movie  possibly even the best movie ever made about the immigrant experience.  I should know because I was an immigrant to the U.S. myself. It is perhaps even mislabled as a comedy since its dramatic aspects outweigh its comedic ones. Its essential point seems to be that if you have a positive attitude you can actually connect with the strange people in a strange land. However its other major point is that no matter how well you adapt the home where your roots are is still your home and you will miss it no matter how awful life there was. And if you are like Vladimir you will also have to deal with an unstable mix of odd jobs friends who never stay in one place too long your new countrys street scum arrogant morons from your motherland and a significant other who will not fully commit to you. However Vladimir realizes that this is not too high a price to pay for freedom to speak your mind travel and really shop around at Bloomingdales. He also winds up appreciating Americas wealth of many different cultures and ethnic backgrounds although the makers of this film were good enough to not bang the viewer over the head with this point. Rather they present it as irreverently and matter of factly as Jim Jarmusch does in his best work. This all amounts to a movie that is very human or humane in a gentle way and rather realistic in its depiction of the less extreme varieties of human nature. Its low key approach is much better for expressing its points than the loads of melodrama which these kinds of movies usually have. The jazz music soundtrack is great too. Basically if youre sick of movies which are overblown and commercial then you will especially appreciate this little gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing this when I was in high school with my father. We laughed a couple of times and may have cheered for the Ivan character at liberating choice to defect but the overall movie was pretty shallow and didn't explore it's liberally slanted memes.The purpose of this movie is predicated on a joke that gets repeated over and over again. The joke is  let's have Robin Williams imitate a Russian immigrant and have him walk around a wild city like New York and see what happens. Yes I admit that premise would be more interesting than if he took a trip to rural Texas or Wyoming. New York with all of its outlandish and colorful sights may provoke much wonder in a wide eyed soul who is inexperienced to such stimuli. So the movie supplants itself in this premise and exploits to unrealistic and sometimes silly parodies. I thought Moscow on the Hudson worked better as a parody but when it tried to overreach as a meaningful commentary on American life and morals it lost its momentum and fell flat.Also a movie increases its appeal and intrigue when it inserts a beautiful and sexy love interest. Maria Conchita Alonso fulfills that promise. I thought their meet cute was okay and I was willing to go along for that ride in Ivan's American experience but she is sort of treated as an object of desire who is romantic but also capable of stereotypical tantrums and resistance. There is also an unflattering scene with Williams and Alonso in a bathtub where he is rubbing his hands over her breasts and expressing his prurient desires. Unfortunately he ends up looking like a lecherous pervert. Both of them look tawdry in that scene and it also ruined his likability for his character who is supposed to come off as a sweet soul. The friendship between Ivan and his Black American friend looks forced as well. Mazursky inaccurately portrays the Black American family as being a family of goodwill and munificence. I know there are some political undertones to Moscow on the Hudson and they are really offensive inasmuch as they allow us to make up our own mind. there are a few funny moments that I will not mention. This is not a great movie by any means. I would never consider it a cornerstone masterpiece of Cultural studies. It is simply a comedy that makes a feeble attempt to be serious.".

	schema:reviewBody "An actor as iconic as Robin Williams playing a Russian? Could it work? You wouldn't think so but the splendid little flick Moscow on the Hudson makes it work. Robin Williams stars as a Russian saxophone player named Vladimir Ivanoff. Vladimir and the circus troupe he performs with take a trip to the United States in to perform. While there Vladimir makes the spontaneous decision to defect while in Bloomingdale's. He manages to get away with it and is left in the states. There he makes friends looks for work and learns why America is the greatest country in the world. The film doesn't come without its cheese but there's something so charming and lovable about the film that I thoroughly enjoyed it.First thing's first Robin Williams is as good as ever in this flick. He sports an impressive Russian accent throughout the film and about a quarter of his dialogue is actually in Russian a language you would think he was already fluent in with how well he spoke it. Plus the character of Vladimir Ivanoff is wonderfully lovable and it's a joy to watch his character progress and mature. Moscow on the Hudson at first starts out with the goofy and confused foreigner who doesn't know what he's doing but it slowly moves away from that clich as it makes Vladimir into a real character rather than a gimmick. He is perfectly believable and goes through a progression that I can buy into. The film deals with the overwhelming nature of America for a foreigner and it hits on some great points that go along with these ideas. Watching as Vladimir copes with the bustling New York City life is entertaining as well as touching and charming. We feel all of his excitement anxiety and even pain as he struggles with such a drastic change in lifestyles.Now as interesting as the character development of this film might be it is served with a heaping side of fresh cheese. There are some undeniably silly moments of the film where it begins to take itself a little too seriously and goes too much of a clichd route to get a point across. I understand that one of the central themes of this film is America as the greatest country in the world despite all of the problems but this point is driven a little too exaggerated at points. There is one particularly eyeroll worthy scene on the fourth of July when Vladimir and other immigrants are quoting the Declaration of Independence and other parts of the Constitution inside a caf showing how we can all come together and put aside our differences. I found this to be a little too obvious and melodramatic and wished the film would have toned down some of the clich in spots. However it didn't keep me from really enjoying the majority of this film.I didn't have a clue what to expect going into Moscow on the Hudson but I'm very glad I watched it. I probably wouldn't sit through it again as I got everything I needed out of one viewing. This is a fun film with great characters and fantastic performances. It delivers a sincere albeit clichd message that makes the film a little more than just another silly foreigner in America film. Plus putting this film in context makes it all the more important. This is a Cold War era film that really pushes a message of peace and love and I give it undying respect for that. It shows that we can get along if we just try while also exemplifying that America stands to be the nation of peace and acceptance. Whether that is true today is up in the air but that's a whole different topic. The fact of the matter is Moscow on the Hudson is a pleasant little film that is well worth a one time watch.".
