Unlike American films Iranian films seem to be very open and even brutally honest about thier pain and frustration. Maybe it's because for many thier situations are so dire and we in America are so jaded by therapy and talk show catch phrases to just open op and fully express how we feel.  The pain that Muhammed and his family felt came accross as very real and genuine.  The art direction was beautiful I had no idea that Iran was such a beautiful place.  It was so ironic that the best part of his home was the part that poor Muhammed could not see but he felt it deeply.  I would strongly suggest that you watch this movie.  Even if your not into subtitles.  My boyfriend and I came accross this movie at 2AM one night and had no intention of watching it but after the first ten minutes we were hooked and talked about it for days.  It is magnificent.".

It is a storyjourney into the world in which we live but don't often see. It left me wondering who in this world are actually blind? This child his grandma and two little sisters are consummate. I must remind myself they were only acting. I must picture set sound lighting script direction etc. to decern that this is only a movie.

With only a father and a grandmother left in his family he looks forward to summer with them once school has finished. Mohammad is full of life even though he cannot see and is constantly exploring with his hands and his grandmother loves him for this. His father is a different story and wants Mohammad out of the way so that he can remarry in an arranged ceremony with a woman who doesn't know about his son. However his plan to send Mohammad far away on an apprenticeship brings him directly into conflict with his son's grandmother.A popular choice for the Oscars in 2000 this film has developed this success and has garnered quite an audience as a result. The story is quite an emotionally involving one that is better than the basic description of the narrative suggests because this is driven by our sympathyempathy for the characters involved. As such it works pretty well as it is easy to relate to the emotions of all of the lead three characters  even the bitterness of the father was something that could be understood and felt for at no point was he simply a bad guy for feeling what he did. At times the story gets a bit too steeped in meaningful sentiment but for the majority it is a well observed and patient story that is quite touching at points.The acting is a big factor in this working as well as it did. Ramezani is the most obvious one to praise and indeed he is praiseworthy for making his character real and convincing while never letting it become a cute kid part as so many brats can't help but do  he may have been drawing on things within himself but this is still a very real performance. Mahjoub is as good for the very reason that he keeps us caring about his character even if what he is feeling is not anything we can condone. Feizi's grandmother is an unremarkable character but she delivers it well with a solid if unimaginative portrayal and performance. The support cast are also strong but it was the lead three that made it what it was. The direction is good sharing an eye for detail and little daily realities with a talent for the bigger landscapes.Overall this is an impressive and enjoyable film that is beautiful to look at and has plenty to engage the heart. It may be a bit up itself at a few points but these are few and far between and the majority of the film succeeds thanks to well written characters and actors who deliver with an apparent good understanding of their characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Majid Majidi director and writer of the muchacclaimed The Children of Heaven has again proven to the world that he is able to demonstrate weighty ideas through simple depictions of everyday life in Iran.  He shows audiences that his country is not just a place where reform movements revolutions and embassy seizing take place but also where beautiful films are made.  His new motion picture The Color of Paradise is a real treat. It is about faith and belief unconditional love and compassion hardship and hope and is both powerful and effective.The lead character is a blind 8yearold boy named Mohammad Mohsen Ramezani.  He is filled with compassion and has unlimited abilities to reach out to the world around him.  Mohammad attends a school for the blind in Tehran.  The school is closing for the summer and students are being sent home to their parents most of them eagerly await their kids at the front gate just outside their dormitories. Hashem Hossein Mahjub Mohammad's father is not eager to see him.  In fact he shows up so much later than everyone else that Mohammad had almost lost hope of ever seeing him again.While waiting for his dad the 8yearold boy although filled with anguish did not shut himself down from the outside world.  He successfully rescues a baby bird climbs a tree and returns it to its nest.  All despite his inability to see.Mohammad's dad finally shows up and requests that the school keep his son. Being told that this is not possible he reluctantly takes the boy home.This is where writer director Majid Majidi's cinematic brilliancy comes into play.  His ability to let the audience experience both the visually impaired and visually unimpaired worlds without ever abandoning one for the other is simply remarkable.  We can see and feel both the beauties of the boy's surroundings and his own world where touching and hearing replace seeing.The photography is breathtaking as father and son trek home from the busy streets of Tehran into traders' and jewelry shops then to the green mountains and fertile plains in the heights of northern Iran.  Mohammad's arrival spurs bursts of joy from his Granny Salime Feizi the matriarch and surrogate mother since his mom passed away and his two sisters Elham Sharifi and Farahnaz Safari with genuine angelic smiles.  They are happy to see him as they are ready to share an active farm life with him.Mohammad's admiration for nature is almost addictive whether it's walking through fields of flowers or running his hand over ripening grain or having fresh water running through his fingers or hearing birds' songs a donkey braying or examining the sound of a gathering storm he literally finds the patterns of Braille in everything around him.  Sounds like a loveable kid?  Not so according to his dad's needs.  For him the blind son is a burden which prevents him from moving on with his life and marrying a younger woman.  Hashem is not a malevolent man.  He is an impoverished fastaging widowed spiritually blind hardworking charcoal maker who sees very little hope with the status quo.  So despite the staunch opposition of his mother he is determined to send Mohammad off to a blind carpenter for woodworking apprenticeship.  But is he ready to bear the consequences of acting against Granny and the universal laws that govern the relationship between a parent and his offspring?The Color of Paradise takes viewers on an incredible journey of faith and love and creates a masterpiece of emotion that is so beautiful in its simplicity and elegance it touches one's heart.  It is done without forcing anything on the audience until the very last frame.  This film does not preach.  And it does not need to its richness lies in its ability to portray basic elements of nature in their ordinary state.  In places where Hollywood counterparts would have inserted blasting soundtracks this movie simply lets nature echo in the background.  Its soundtracks mostly consist of nature's own.  In times of great suspense the sound of nature not humanmade music helps its audience through the changing moods.Couple these facts with almost flawless acting it's hard to compare this film with anything else in its league.  It is simply Iranian cinema at its best.  Mohsen Ramezani who plays Mohammad is excellent.  A scene in which he breaks down in tears over his tribulations and questions God for making his dad not wanting him is brutally heart wrenching.  Mohammad eventually shows us that it is possible to feel God's hand even if one can't see the color of paradise.".

I'm sure no one who has not been to Iran has any idea at all that it is this beautiful. There is plenty of symbolism for any particular point of view which makes it fun to talk about after you see it and although it is probably intended to be religious from the Islam point of view you could probably find in this movie your own brand of spirituality or lack of it if you cared to try. I a typically cynical and jaded New Yorker and my completely enthusiastic and nonjaded adolescent daughter both loved it and hope to see it again. So go see it and make it a success so we can get more movies like it over here!!".

In addition to watching this film I watched a prior film by the same marvelous director Children of Heaven and found them both to be absolute joys.PART of the reason I think I enjoyed the film so much could be the subject matter since it hits so close to home. The lead is a very lovable child named Muhammad who has been dumped into a school for blind children and his very selfish father wants to leave him thereeven during the summer break. I have a deaf daughter and know of MANY kids in deaf residential programs with similar families so it REALLY hit close to home.So about the film. What did I like? Pretty much EVERYTHINGthe writing the wonderful acting by REAL people like the Italian NeoRealistic films of DeSica the exquisite cinematography and the sense of growth and change within the characters WITHOUT being unrealistic or overthetop. This film will almost certainly make you cry as there are some incredibly sad and heartrending moments BUT bear with ityou will be amply rewarded if you watch it to the very end.A fantastic marvelous and wonderful film from a reviewer who is usually a bit of a cynic and RARELY rates anything this high!".

	schema:reviewBody "Majidi's films are truly one of a kind. When world media is too preoccupied with portraying Iran as a country where revolutions reform movements and extreme corruption takes place his films remind the world that there's another side to the beautiful country. 'Range Khoda' displays the beauty through the simplicity of everyday life in Iran.The story revolves around a blind little boy named Mohammed who's been admitted to a boarding school for the blind and now that the summer holidays are about to begin he eagerly awaits his father to take him home for the holidays. His father reluctantly arrives later than everyone else. He sees his son as a burden a obstacle that prevents him from moving further in life. However his grandmother and two sisters are thrilled to see Mohammed.The characters are beautifully written. Each and every one of them are recognizable as humans we have met at some point in life. Hashem for example isn't an evil person. After losing his wife and his faith and being affected by poverty and aging he has his own struggles to overcome and he sees his own son's handicap as another struggle while fearing that there will be no one to take care of him at old age. But all of this prevents him from seeing what a gifted spirited kind and lovable child Mohammed is.The cinematography is first rate. None of the shots look staged. Every setting looks raw and authentic. The Persian landscape is breathtaking. Music is used to a minimum. Actually it's the sounds of nature that 'function' as background score by affecting the mood. Majidi also leaves some elements open to the viewer's interpretation such as the frightening sound of the 'djin' and the very ending itself.The performances are spellbinding. I wonder how the director got child actors to deliver such sincere performances. Mohsen Ramezani Farahnaz Safari and Elham Sharifi act so naturally. Hossein Mahjoub is excellent as the tormented Hashem and Salameh Feyzi wins the audience's heart right from her first scene.Needless to say Majidi's films are gems. As a lover of cinemaI find the experience of a Majidi film to be quite precious as they remind me of appreciating the beauty of daily life and nature.".

	schema:headline " Simple yet captivating movie which speaks a larger message";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is quite possibly the most unpretentious and heartfelt film I have ever seen. There are no dirty scenes which seem to pop up in so many movies nowadays and retains a certain pure quality to it. The pace may seem a bit slow sometimes yet director Majidi draws a plotline so tightly focused that my attention practically never strayed. In my opinion the pace is necessary to absorb the feeling for the characters  to allow them to grow on you. The main character truly is blind in real life. The acting comes across as more genuine. The characters surrounding him both magnify or serve as a great contrast to developing his own personality to the viewer. Therefore some characters may appear quite simple in their presentation and their characters left a bit undeveloped but that draws us even closer to the emotional depth and plight of the main character the blind boy. We are given an intimate look into his character's earnest search for love and acceptance and how he readily gives it to those around him. Even though this boy is very young I think that even older age groups can somehow relate to his search for pure love and acceptance especially from the one being that everyone is blind to at least physically  God.On the surface the acting may seem somewhat simple but that makes the underlying message even stronger. It makes the movie seem more like a surreal blur between a fantasy fable and reallife. Not knowing how to clearly draw the line adds to the beauty and magnetism of this movie. There is a strong universally spiritual yet nondenominational component to this. It is not preachy in my opinion because it makes mention of God without constantly waving a specific religious denomination in your face. I was deeply touched at certain scenes that I believe will stay with me for a long time. If you are looking for a movie with a solid storyline and emotionallymoving message check out this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This the only movie I have ever watched and given a 10 out of 10 score. I consider myself to be pretty hardened having been a street cop for over 22 years and a firefighter for 10 years before that. I have seen a lot of human suffering and I have become very hardened to it but this movie had me in tears more than once. It's about a innocent little boy who lives in the mountains of Iran and has been blind since birth. His mother has recently died and his father considers him a burden not only on his life in general but also toward his attempt to find another bride. The boy has been sent to live and study at a school for the blind and here you will see blindness from a myriad causes we are lucky to no longer have in the USA. The boy has an innate intelligence and a strong curiosity about the world around him which he experiences as a world of sound and tactile senses. His father wants him to stay in the school but he is forced to take him home and now he is concerned that his brides family will find out he has bad genes or something. Once home the boy reconnects with a loving grandmother and 2 loving sisters and even the people of his village are tolerant of him and show him affection. Yet his father schemes to be rid of him and at times you can see in his eyes he couldn't be blamed if the boy wandered off or befell some other natural death. However the father finds a blind carpenter a long way away who takes the boy as an apprentice. But from the start guilt seems to be chasing the father and we see him reacting to a raucous type of bird call from the deep forest that appears at these moment as if it is a demon calling him out in accusation. Several aspects begin to drag at the father weighing him down with guilt until the end when he must decide to let the boy die in a natural accident or will his love for the boy finally over come his past transgressions guilt and self pity. Will the father step back and let nature take its course or will his love for the boy finally wake him up to the fact that his son has always been a blessing on him not a weight around his neck. And will his decision come in time to save his soul and the boy's life? The makers of this movie prove that excellence knows no border and cannot be stifled.".

The movie is deliberately simplistic in nature but quite charming and delightful at the same time.The sequence in the beginning where the blind boy rescues a baby bird climbs the tree and puts it back in the nest is an amazing scene and says so much about the character in such a short instant.

Life is what we make of it. Who is the one actually blind the boy or the people around him? What do we actually see around us? The absence of one sense makes the other senses so acute. The boy was much more attuned to his surrounding environment than anyone else.There's no actual background music used in the movie but it utilizes the sounds of nature to tell about the environment which is even more effective.The ending feels a little contrived but it's upto satisfaction.

	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Lee gives a splendid performance in one of the most charming films made in Great Britain in recent memory. A Feast at Midnight is one of those warm family entertainments that manages to delight both children and parents alike.Young Magnus Gove Freddie Findlay is sent away to an austere boarding school that manages to serve the most unpalatable of meals. Even the Headmaster Robert Hardy can barely stomach the overly healthy menu. Magnus' father Edward Fox in a short cameo sends him a number of enticing recipes which spur Magnus and his oddball group of friends to venture in the dead of night into that forbidden noboys land of The Kitchen. There they discover the true meaning of friendship as they concoct the most unlikely of meals. The interaction between the boys that make up The Scoffers club is priceless. All handled with just the right tone by director Justin Hardy son of The Wicker Man's Robin Hardy to avoid falling into the bottomless well of gushing sentimentality.Christopher Lee handles the key role of Latin Master V. E. Longfellow aka Raptor with great aplomb. His stern features belie a warm and funfilled heart as is evidenced by the exchange of lowkey double entendre with Miss Plunder Carol Macready the housekeeper over her homecooked meals. One of the most memorable moments is of course the kitchen scene homage to Jurassic Park. I can't even begin to explain just how pleasing this scene is. There is no question that Mr. Lee's character lives up to and deserves the Raptor moniker! To check out a clip of the Raptor sequence visit the Multimedia page here at the site. There is also a very gentle homage to Hammer as Raptor wakes in the night upon hearing a noise his eyes pop open in a darkened room in a way that is very reminiscent of a Transylvanian Count. Truly one of Mr. Lee's best and warmest performances. An excellent demonstration of why Christopher Lee is far more than simply a horror icon but a multitalented actor capable of a wide range of characterization! Enjoy...".

The lush Dover location and surprisingly poignant music also add dimensions of richness to a very simple honest story.The focal characters are realistically bad and good boys  realistic because often the same boys are both bad and good under believable circumstances  who learn about the real meaning of friendship teamwork and even honor through well cooking.  Do have fattening and decadent snacks on hand when you watch because what the boys whip up will certainly make you hungry.Incidentally this film also managed to charm my boyfriend and to hold his interest throughout and since this is such a tiny little dessert of a film and since said boyfriend generally goes for the gamut of action flicks from Jackie Chan to Akira Kurosawa or 2hour Chow YunFatJohn Woo bloodbaths this is really saying something.  Because of the way the film gets right into the world of children while not abandoning entirely the world and motivations of adults I would also certainly recommend it for children age 8 or 10 and up but there are still enough jokes and subtleties for grownups only that it won't bore parents.".

The humor in this film is not as gross as some of the socalled comedies that are being produced today but that to me is all the better. I was impressed by the veteran actors especially Christopher Lee. His character Major Longfellow or Raptor as he is known was very well played. Although Raptor takes himself very seriously he does seem to end up in some of the most absurd situations especially regarding Miss Plunder. You might not guess that Mr. Lee who is well known for his horror films would have a great sense of humor but he does. I have to say that the script was original and the child actors were excellent. The scenery was gorgeous and the music fit perfectly. It is a shame that this little gem is not out on DVD. Everyone that I have shown this movie to has loved it.".

This movie talks about friendship comrade's love sex loneliness betrayal fun sadness death sons. In one sentence it talks about life.There is a lot of FUN in this movie as the main characters seem to never grow up they just want to joke about everything NOTHING is really THAT important or serious to be spared by jokes. The son of the journalist is more mature and serious than his father... remember that we are in 1975 and this is absolutely counterintuitive!! in that period young people were fighting on the streets for freedom of thoughts of sex and for political reasons!! Well in some ways young people during that period were more socially committed than their fathers who wanted to preserve the status quo. In this movie however the middleaged characters make fun of the status quo the broken noble betrays his wife for a teenager the surgeon does not care to leave the hospital in troubles for joining his friends the journalist does not understand his son and never tries to the architect wants to conquer the heart of a married woman etc... it's like OK you youngsters do not care about the old moral rules? we your fathers too even more than you... It's also a sad movie as this search for continuous fun is a sign that something is wrong in their lives. The architect leaves his new family to join the company for the joke at the train station as he is fed up with all the problems a real and traditional family provide. Normality is boring and annoying. Fun comes from friends and from breaking the moral or society rules. It's better a good joke even a cruel one and have fun than keep a normal lifestyle and be bored this is a philosophy that some Italians really have.There is plenty of UNpolitically correct situations... feminist people can be very nervous seeing this movie... remember that it's a movie that reflects a particular culture the Tuscany of almost forty years ago the movie is set in the 60's. But real love is not banned in this movie... it's just a cynic point of view real love ends up eventually when it becomes normal life. I have seen several times this movie and every time I enjoy it. Also the sequel is good but the first is just incredible. Do not miss this movie. You'll have lots of laughs and an essay about certain Italian culture.".

Wherever they go they bring mayhem with them. Their lunacy is both a reaction to and a comment on the lunatic world they see around them. The operatic clown Rigoletto was a sad fool too and this quartet of sad fools elicits both our laughter and our pity.The film was directed by Mario Monicelli from a script by Pietro Germi creator of some of Italy's best comedysatires like SEDUCED AND ABANDONED and DIVORCE ITALIAN STYLE.There is Mascetti Ugo Tognazzi a former count who has squandered his own and his wife's inheritance.  He now sells encyclopedias is soon fired from that job and treats his longsuffering wife and child as excess baggage shipping them off to her relatives so he can be alone with his crackpot cronies. He also pursues a lamebrained little lush called Titti even after her colonelfather almost kills him with a shotgun and after discovering her in a lesbian attachment.There is Necchi Duilio Del Prete a horny cafe' owner who while atop his wife tells her to hurry so he can get out with the guys and have some real fun.  Male camaraderie means more to these people than heterosexual love and implies an ambivalent latent homosexuality.We see Melandri Gastone Moschina lovesick cop who is eager to possess Olga Karlatos the neurotic wife of a gifted surgeon Adolfo Celi. The doctor oddly consents to turn over his wife to him provided Melandri accepts two small daughters a German governess and a twoton St.Bernard. No way. Erotic love has its limits. He quickly returns to the boys in a state of exhaustion.Then there is Perozzi Philippe Noiret the narrator whose death ends the film. He lives with a humorless son who does not approve of the father's childish pranks such as pretending to be a hunchback to ward off an unwanted woman. Perozzi is also estranged from a wife who loathes him. She is unable to express pity at his death.  What was he? Nothing. she says. Yet we know it to be that kind of nothing that is a challenge by a sad fool to the smug complacency of his son who is a person that faces life as though it were a death sentence. Whatever these clowns are at least they are alive! In the hierarchy of fooldom the son appears as loathsome while his father commands some admiration.Some of the episodes in the film are comedy of the first magnitude. Pietro Germiwho wrote the screenplay had to withdraw from directing the film after a serious illness. He later died. Mario Monicelli a notable directorial talent in his own right took over the film and imparts to it a winsome ribald flavor you have to savor to appreciate.There is one episode in which the four with the addition of sometimemember Celi the doctor enter a small town with maps and surveying equipment and convince the townspeople and a bewildered priest that the village must be leveled to make way for a new highway. In a truly hilarious episode we watch the group slapping the faces of passengers leaning out of the windows of a train departing from a platform.Another fairly grotesque scene has the group inviting itself to a party at a villa. Necchi relieves himself in a little child's potty and the resulting volume of excremental emission provokes hysteria among the child's family when they discover the contents.In another long sequence the men dupe gullible Righi Bernard Blier into believing they are a group of gangsters pushing heroin.

Guido Necchi played by Duilio del Prete didn't act in the 2nd part. We have Renzo Montagnani who plays a good job but not better than Duilio del Prete. You can see Rambaldo Melandri Gastone Moschin in The godfather part 2. He is the old man dressed in white suit who Robert DeNiro shoot with a gun while there is the crowd in the street. Adolfo Celi does an excellent role too very funny. Also in the 2n part. There is a 3rd part with Ugo Tognazzi Renzo Montagnani Adolfo Celi and Gastone Moschin. Philippe Noiret wasn't here only in 1st and 2nd part. This 3rd part is not so good but it is interesting anyway. We can see Bernard Blier again who did the role of Niccolo Righi in the first part the old man who in the first moment believes sugar is drug... You can find the three parts in Internet in Emule look for Amici miei. The sound is Italian and very interesting. The 1st part longs around 20 minutes more than the first edition of the film and shows very funny scenes with the 5 men and Niccolo Righi. There is a pack with the trilogy in DVD in Italy. And I think it should be a 4th disc with deleted scenes interviews and more. But I think there were some problems and now it is hard to find it. Finally you can enjoy watching Ugo Tognazzi and Philippe Noiret together in the Marco Ferreri film La grande bouffe. I hope there is someday a DVD with English subtitles for all of you. Enjoy!

	schema:reviewBody "My experience of Italian comedy before seeing this film extended only to the sex comedies featuring such beauties as Edwige Fenech and Barbara Bouchet and although I enjoyed the humour in most of the ones I've seen I have to admit that generally I enjoyed the films more because of the stars. My Friends is a straight Italian comedy and thus the reliance is on the jokes and situations more than sexy lead stars to sell it and while I cant say that the film is laugh out loud funny at least not to my tastes this is a very good film and certainly one that will appeal to fans of Italian humour. The plot is fairly simple and as the title suggests basically just focuses on a group of four friends. They're all middle aged and have good professions with one exception. They wander around town and get their kicks by pulling pranks and generally annoying people. The film features a number of plot threads the first of which sees the gang land themselves in hospital and one of them ends up meeting the beautiful wife of the top surgeon.My Friends is something of a film of two halves and I have to say that I enjoyed the first half more. The tone is always light and breezy although the film does get a bit more ambitious and involving in the second half and that doesn't suit it as well. There doesn't really seem to be a defining point to it the only one I could see really was the idea of the central characters being older men and still enjoying life. The lead characters are depicted as almost being like children and that's one of the film's biggest running jokes and seeing grown men mess around like the characters in this film has a sort of surreal humour of it's own. The film focuses more on situation than any actual gags and we do get some interesting and well worked scenes that are very funny seeing a load of middle aged men slapping passengers on a train for example is fun to watch. I would imagine that most of this film's fans are native Italians and I can't see a film like this ever being a big hit outside of it's native country  but for fans of Italian movies this comedy is a winner.".

	schema:headline " a review of MY FRIENDS and ALL MY FRIENDS PART 2";
	schema:reviewBody "MY FRIENDS is originally a project for Italian writerdirector Pietro Germi whose untimely death in 1974 at the age of 60 leaves the film to be taken over by another maestro of the Commedia all'Italiana Mario Monicelli. The film was a whopping boxoffice success which subsequently would spawn two sequels Monicelli would be back in the saddle with ALL MY FRIENDS PART 2 1982 and ALL MY FRIENDS PART 3 1985 would be outsourced to Nanni Loy. A doublebill of these two Monicelli's vehicles set in Florence MY FRIENDS has a quartet core of middleaged men Count Lello Mascetti Tognhzzi a downandout exnobleman who has squandered all his fortunes can only slum it in a tiny basement with his suicidedriven wife Alice Vukotic and their daughter which doesn't dissuade him from being smitten with an underage student Titti Dionisio who has a predilection for girls over men the second one is Giorgio Perozzi Noiret a journalist separated from his wife Laura Goodwin and is irreconcilably at adds with his prim adult son then there is Rambaldo Melandri Moschin a bachelor architect determined to find his perfect half and lastly is Guido Necchi Del Prete married with Carmen Tamantini and they own a bar which serves as their haunt. Life is anything but optimistic Pietro Germi and co.'s script conscientiously draws the milieu from reality in both Mascetti and Perozzi's cases one might easily finds company in distress and self abandonment but not these four feeding on their staunch friendship the fold never relinquish their idiosyncratic practical jokes and escapades mostly ingenious and borderline harmless counting their classic passengersslapping when a train departs and Mascetti's trademark supercazzola gibberish. And following Melandri's tireless pursuit of a married woman Donatella Karlatos an embodiment of Madonna with psychological hiccups a fifth member Professor Sassaroli Celi is introduced a renowned surgeon and the husband of Donatella who is perversely liberal about the affair and is more than happy to not stand in their way if they are really made for each other and of course they are not but Sassaroli is here to stay. One of their most detailed skits involves a pennypinching pensioner Righi Blier who is hustled into believing that the quartet belongs to a mafia mob with Sassaroli as their boss dangled by the profitable income Righi buckles down to join in their dangerous lineofwork and their adventure culminates in a selforganized gangster melee which leaves Righi in chagrin utterly sidesplitting thanks to Blier's bangup pofaced bearing. The coda of MY FRIENDS deflects to a more sombre streak  a heart attack does Peruzzi in all happens in a sudden but no grim sorrow is allowed to percolate his friends keep their comic esprit de corps alive even death cannot take it away. ALL MY FRIENDS PART 2 comes 7 years later the story continues after Peruzzi's abrupt departure the original cast returns significantly older except Del Prete who is replaced by a more prosaic looking Renzo Montagnani as Necchi only the latter is not endowed with Del Prete's dashing and devilmaycare panache. The part 2 doesn't structurally pigeonhole itself as a strict sequel owing to the huge pull of Noiret's Perozzi there are abundant flashbacks charting Perozzi and Mascetti's past stories which take place earlier than those in the first one while without ghettoizing Sassaroli out of the picture the original four becomes a quintet it conspicuously creates some anachronism for viewers with fresh memory of the first installment. Gallantly interpolating the flood of Arno in 1966 the story manages to expound on Perozzi's marriage disintegration and take a taunting spin on Melandri's another devoted courtship to a voluptuous but Godfearing young girl Noemi Giordano.Contriving an act of pulling Pisa tower back in perpendicular gatecrushing a singing contest with a risqu song a cappella in the presence of cardinals a chirpy caper involving a Spanish contortionist Da Silva their shticks never disappoint meanwhile Mascetti has his own familial problem when his slowwitted daughter is impregnated by an unknown rapist and decides to become an unwed mother. Finally a guest performance from Paolo Stoppa as Savino a Shylock to whom Mascetti is indebted he would fall prey into the quartet's pranks includes a scatological one which sublimely tips the scale and undergo several invisible operations to square off Mascetti's debts. Similarly another heart attack befalls on one of the main characters near the finish but this time to a lesser extent Tognazzi Moschin Noiret and Celi are all sterling comedians but it is Tognazzi who stands out in his more sympathetic noblemanindistress mould. Inscribing their marks as quintessential pieces of Commedia all'Italiana both films are salacious amoral and pathologically funny although the second one only logically contends to take a leaf from its predecessor's book. But essentially they are not connived as farfetched escapist fares with a shamelessly patronizing smugness their gypsyish antics are genuinely devised to imbue a positive vibe out of their quotidian misfortunes despite that they can never hit the right note of the gender politics yet what do you expect from a buddy movie?".

The film was a whopping boxoffice success which subsequently would spawn two sequels Monicelli would be back in the saddle with ALL MY FRIENDS PART 2 1982 and ALL MY FRIENDS PART 3 1985 would be outsourced to Nanni Loy. A doublebill of these two Monicelli's vehicles set in Florence MY FRIENDS has a quartet core of middleaged men Count Lello Mascetti Tognhzzi a downandout exnobleman who has squandered all his fortunes can only slum it in a tiny basement with his suicidedriven wife Alice Vukotic and their daughter which doesn't dissuade him from being smitten with an underage student Titti Dionisio who has a predilection for girls over men the second one is Giorgio Perozzi Noiret a journalist separated from his wife Laura Goodwin and is irreconcilably at adds with his prim adult son then there is Rambaldo Melandri Moschin a bachelor architect determined to find his perfect half and lastly is Guido Necchi Del Prete married with Carmen Tamantini and they own a bar which serves as their haunt. Life is anything but optimistic Pietro Germi and co.'s script conscientiously draws the milieu from reality in both Mascetti and Perozzi's cases one might easily finds company in distress and self abandonment but not these four feeding on their staunch friendship the fold never relinquish their idiosyncratic practical jokes and escapades mostly ingenious and borderline harmless counting their classic passengersslapping when a train departs and Mascetti's trademark supercazzola gibberish. And following Melandri's tireless pursuit of a married woman Donatella Karlatos an embodiment of Madonna with psychological hiccups a fifth member Professor Sassaroli Celi is introduced a renowned surgeon and the husband of Donatella who is perversely liberal about the affair and is more than happy to not stand in their way if they are really made for each other and of course they are not but Sassaroli is here to stay. One of their most detailed skits involves a pennypinching pensioner Righi Blier who is hustled into believing that the quartet belongs to a mafia mob with Sassaroli as their boss dangled by the profitable income Righi buckles down to join in their dangerous lineofwork and their adventure culminates in a selforganized gangster melee which leaves Righi in chagrin utterly sidesplitting thanks to Blier's bangup pofaced bearing. The coda of MY FRIENDS deflects to a more sombre streak  a heart attack does Peruzzi in all happens in a sudden but no grim sorrow is allowed to percolate his friends keep their comic esprit de corps alive even death cannot take it away. ALL MY FRIENDS PART 2 comes 7 years later the story continues after Peruzzi's abrupt departure the original cast returns significantly older except Del Prete who is replaced by a more prosaic looking Renzo Montagnani as Necchi only the latter is not endowed with Del Prete's dashing and devilmaycare panache. The part 2 doesn't structurally pigeonhole itself as a strict sequel owing to the huge pull of Noiret's Perozzi there are abundant flashbacks charting Perozzi and Mascetti's past stories which take place earlier than those in the first one while without ghettoizing Sassaroli out of the picture the original four becomes a quintet it conspicuously creates some anachronism for viewers with fresh memory of the first installment. Gallantly interpolating the flood of Arno in 1966 the story manages to expound on Perozzi's marriage disintegration and take a taunting spin on Melandri's another devoted courtship to a voluptuous but Godfearing young girl Noemi Giordano.Contriving an act of pulling Pisa tower back in perpendicular gatecrushing a singing contest with a risqu song a cappella in the presence of cardinals a chirpy caper involving a Spanish contortionist Da Silva their shticks never disappoint meanwhile Mascetti has his own familial problem when his slowwitted daughter is impregnated by an unknown rapist and decides to become an unwed mother. Finally a guest performance from Paolo Stoppa as Savino a Shylock to whom Mascetti is indebted he would fall prey into the quartet's pranks includes a scatological one which sublimely tips the scale and undergo several invisible operations to square off Mascetti's debts. Similarly another heart attack befalls on one of the main characters near the finish but this time to a lesser extent Tognazzi Moschin Noiret and Celi are all sterling comedians but it is Tognazzi who stands out in his more sympathetic noblemanindistress mould. Inscribing their marks as quintessential pieces of Commedia all'Italiana both films are salacious amoral and pathologically funny although the second one only logically contends to take a leaf from its predecessor's book. But essentially they are not connived as farfetched escapist fares with a shamelessly patronizing smugness their gypsyish antics are genuinely devised to imbue a positive vibe out of their quotidian misfortunes despite that they can never hit the right note of the gender politics yet what do you expect from a buddy movie?";

Or pick on a gluttonous man by pretending to be gangsters they take this gag to the very extreme it is an important part of the film. Or taking a dump in a little kids potty.Even the aging have a right to have fun and they do so by showing their asses to the miserable society that lives by the rules.

Monicelli foregrounds the picaresque nature of the friends but keeps reminding us that not everything is OK. The square characters keep turning up every once in a while.The film has a very nonintrusive background score. It is used in the beginning to set the mood.

From the getgo.There are a tiny handful of films I've ever walked out of. Ilsa She Wolf of the SS comes to mind. I'd had one gratuitous torture scene too many in that instance.I walked out of this ostensible comedy after 80 minutes during the funfilled suicide scene. I remember that there was a laugh during the film's first half hour although it seems hard to believe that there were any at all in retrospect.Philippe Noiret is in the cast. He's a personal favourite and usually a reliable judge of material. His faith in this script was misplaced.Noiret is involved in what should have been one of the film's subtle moments. The four old buddies the central characters sing the quartet from Verdi's Rigoletto. The song is not identified as such. It's an Italian movie so there's no need to. Then later Noiret sports a fake hump on his back just like the tragic court jester. Obviously someone Germi? had a gag in mind at this point but no connection is made between the two incidents. It's just dead like the rest of the film.The four buddies are the central characters and the central problem. As we get to know them they turn out to be malicious jerks  sort of the middleaged Jerky Boys of Italy  and they are soon enough joined by a fifth halfwit.I regret to say that these loutish characters like some of the same things I do like Cynar and finocchio. That's about the only thing they have to their credit.Director Mario Monicelli recycles one of Germi's old sight gags. During a caper one of the four the crudest of the funnymen Ugo Tognazzi is seen reading a copy of Famiglia Cristiana magazine. Ha ha. That particular incongruity was tastefully funny back when Germi was directing in Seduced and Abandoned 1964 I think it was. Not here.The screening did receive steady laughs throughout most noticeably from the two fellows of questionable taste behind me.

	schema:headline " Is it obsession or love?";
	schema:reviewBody "The only criticism I would have of this enthralling Polish language film by the great PolishFrench director Krzysztof Kieslowski is his use of the opened window conceit. Magda Grazyna Szapolowska is a woman who lives alone in a high rise housing development. She is sexy and cynical to the point of not believing in love. To her it is all desire and the fulfillment or frustration of desire. Across the way from her lives a virginal young man by the name of Tomek Olaf Lubaszenko who has been spying on her from his apartment window through a telescope.He lives with a friend's mother Stefania Iwinska who looks after him as her own son. He works in the post office and obsesses about Magda's life. He watches her with her beaux. He even goes so far as to write a couple of phony money order slips for her and put them in her mailbox just so she will have to go to his window and ask about them. When she does he is able to examine her features closely. Is his an obsession or is it love? Kieslowski's answer is that it is love love with the kind of depth and feeling that Magda cannot even imagine until she experiences it. And then she is amazed and dumbfounded.The key scene in the movie occurs when Tomek is finally able to be together with the object of his love in her apartment with her telling him that When a woman wants a man she gets wet inside.

As usual with Kieslowski human feelings predominate and are stark and one might say conflictedthe conflict arising between humankind's baser instincts and the more civilized ones of society. What he does here is turn the stalker into the saint in a sense and the object of his love into something unworthy of that love.The question might arise is it realistic to believe that a woman would leave her windows open and her lights on for all to see inside while she goes about her private life? No it isn't. But we have to accept this device. After that the film is fully realistic to the point of even being mundane in its depiction of middle class city life. The characters are ordinary and even a little boring except for Tomek's supreme obsession. It is this jewel in the heart of the Polish city that lifts his life and her life above the ordinary. Even though we know that she is too old and too worldweary for him and that he is too hopelessly young and inexperienced for her for lasting love to ever bloom between them we cannot help but think how wonderful it would be if we could all feel as he does or be the object of such love.Usually when this theme is worked out it is the obsessed who suffer greatly it is the obsessed who are to be pitiedand we do to some extent feel something close to that for Tomek. But here it is Magda who we end up pitying the more because of her inability to love. Compared to Tomek she is a deprived creature who will never find true happinessunless she learns this lesson she has gotten from this young man whose passion for her was unlike anything she had ever experienced before.And this is Kieslowski's point it is not only better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. It is only through love that we can truly identify with another human being. We see this in the scene where Madga is looking through Tomek's telescope into her apartment window and recalling what he had seen one day the day that she had come home and spilled the milk and sat at the table crying over that spilled milk very typical of Kieslowski to use such an obvious but telling and entirely apt clich after a breakup with one of her boyfriends. In memory she sees Tomek looking at her crying and running her finger through the spilled milk and she realizes the depth of his commiseration with her and his love for her and in her mind's eye she sees him beside her as he truly was psychologically with his hand on her shoulder and love in his heart.We might think that at some other time she will look back on a relationship she had had in her life and realize that the failure was due to a lack of love on her part. Indeed she more or less reveals that to us when she tells Tomek's Godmother that no she is not the right person for Tomek. We know that she is too cynical and would only use him temporarily for gratification and that would be all.But I was left with the sense that Magda would indeed learn from her experience and would be transformed. There is this sense of hope and the possibility of emotional and spiritual growth that is often seen in the films of Krzysztof Kieslowski.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	onyx:emotionText "The only criticism I would have of this enthralling Polish language film by the great PolishFrench director Krzysztof Kieslowski is his use of the opened window conceit. Magda Grazyna Szapolowska is a woman who lives alone in a high rise housing development. She is sexy and cynical to the point of not believing in love. To her it is all desire and the fulfillment or frustration of desire. Across the way from her lives a virginal young man by the name of Tomek Olaf Lubaszenko who has been spying on her from his apartment window through a telescope.He lives with a friend's mother Stefania Iwinska who looks after him as her own son. He works in the post office and obsesses about Magda's life. He watches her with her beaux. He even goes so far as to write a couple of phony money order slips for her and put them in her mailbox just so she will have to go to his window and ask about them. When she does he is able to examine her features closely. Is his an obsession or is it love? Kieslowski's answer is that it is love love with the kind of depth and feeling that Magda cannot even imagine until she experiences it. And then she is amazed and dumbfounded.The key scene in the movie occurs when Tomek is finally able to be together with the object of his love in her apartment with her telling him that When a woman wants a man she gets wet inside. And she invites him to check it out so to speak. But what happens does not lead to any kind of fulfillment. Instead Tomek is inadvertently humiliated.And that's the story more or less.

	schema:reviewBody "Everything about this movie suggest the work of a pretentious young man who thinks his work is deep and moving. This was my first Kieslowski film but if his other movies are anything like this I'll be giving them a pass.Our main character is Tomek a creepy stalker whose mind seems not to have matured any further than the age of 12. We watch him spy on an older woman who's become jaded and views love as synonymous with sex. He harasses her constantly in the innocent and futile hope of getting her to talk to him. Eventually he gets his wish and she falls completely headoverheels for him. The whole thing is extremely unrealistic and suggested to me that the director is a real insecure guy. The whole story and script play out like an personal sobstory of Why don't girls like me? I'm such a nice guy! I'm kind and gentle and all they ever do is go out with jerks who give them sex!I'm kind of shocked how everyone fell under the director's spell here. Everyone in the reviews here is gushing about how this film is a wonderful portrayal of love. Love? Where's the love? Certainly not from Tomek. The argument could be made that his love is pure because he is pure of heart but this isn't at all the impression I got from the film. He's obsessive creepy and honestly a bit scary. His love is clearly an infatuation and is entirely baseless. He doesn't know this woman and has only observed her through subversive sexual acts. The scene in which he asks his mother why people cry is laughable and the scene in which he slits his wrists is completely unbelievable. Why did he do that? He was embarrassed that he splooged in his pants? Big deal. It's an insult to people who struggle with thoughts of suicide.So what's the message here? Love is more than sex!!!!!!!!!? Yeah well obviously. Of course it is and more than that love is certainly not how it's portrayed in this movie. The complexities and subtleties of love are not at all explored rather the director wanks off in shots he thinks are deep and moving and poetic. Just because something is slowmoving often silent and utilizes an emotional violin soundtrack doesn't mean it's meaningful.Huge disappointment.".

Tomek is nineteen years old a single guy who works in a post office. Every night he spies on Magda a middleaged woman who lives in the building across. He falls in love with her and decides to profess his love one day after seeing her cry the previous night. At first Magda doesn't take him seriously and she eventually hurts him. What follows after is both tragic and moving. This film is really spellbinding from the powerful human emotions it displays to its sincere silent moments. It is a true gem of cinema a special story waiting to be told. The characters are very real and the emotions they convey very honest. The obsession and the desperation felt by the protagonists are simply too painful to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "Kieslowski is essential viewing in his three long form masterpieces the Colors trilogy. His strength is in layered realities each that annotates the other according to an ineffable model. That ineffability is the lasting magic of his work not the content of any layer.His decalogue projects are all short film involving only one layer per film. All ten considered collectively layer like the long form projects do.He extended two of the short form decalogues and induced a layer or two. This is one so is an inbetween case essentially practice for the more ambitious and less explicit projects.But what practice!This is voyeurism about voyeurism something that teases us into obsession about obsession.The story centers on a naive boy enchanted by an unknowing woman who herself seems excessive about desire. All is a setup for their encounter where his commitment to the desire destroys the engagement. Can real love be anything but obsessive? Can obsession lead to anything other than its own neutralization? Can that end be reinvented to both comfort and bear comfortable gifts?Yes yes and yes by the magic of reimagining something that movies  some movies  do well. In fact one might say that movies invented modern love by allowing it to BE reinvented.The mechanism here is by watching which both he and we do The telescope is draped with the same cloth that our object of desire Magda is weaving into the fabric of her art. She removes that fabric from the telescope at the end adding it at the same time.The milk serves a similar function as do the broken message chains.We have two moments where the film allows us to reconsider. The first is at the very beginning where the suicide at this point still probably an attempt is revealed. A touch is offered with such complexity and delicacy that the entire film then revisits reinvents and annotates that touch.The second moment is at the end. This where we learn that Magda may have been the suicide and the touch through the eye a touch we are offering ourselves at just this moment allows it to never happen.I often get requests for recommendations and rarely give them. But if you want a film to watch with someone you wished you loved if your notion of love is excessively romantic and woven in the aftermoments if you are sensitive to layered vision and that vision is on the lip of the tipping bottle...If you are both afraid and unafraid and touch is what life is for you... then this is what I recommend.Ted's Evaluation 3 Worth Watching.".

This is one so is an inbetween case essentially practice for the more ambitious and less explicit projects.But what practice!This is voyeurism about voyeurism something that teases us into obsession about obsession.The story centers on a naive boy enchanted by an unknowing woman who herself seems excessive about desire. All is a setup for their encounter where his commitment to the desire destroys the engagement. Can real love be anything but obsessive? Can obsession lead to anything other than its own neutralization? Can that end be reinvented to both comfort and bear comfortable gifts?Yes yes and yes by the magic of reimagining something that movies  some movies  do well. In fact one might say that movies invented modern love by allowing it to BE reinvented.The mechanism here is by watching which both he and we do The telescope is draped with the same cloth that our object of desire Magda is weaving into the fabric of her art. She removes that fabric from the telescope at the end adding it at the same time.The milk serves a similar function as do the broken message chains.We have two moments where the film allows us to reconsider. The first is at the very beginning where the suicide at this point still probably an attempt is revealed. A touch is offered with such complexity and delicacy that the entire film then revisits reinvents and annotates that touch.The second moment is at the end. This where we learn that Magda may have been the suicide and the touch through the eye a touch we are offering ourselves at just this moment allows it to never happen.I often get requests for recommendations and rarely give them. But if you want a film to watch with someone you wished you loved if your notion of love is excessively romantic and woven in the aftermoments if you are sensitive to layered vision and that vision is on the lip of the tipping bottle...If you are both afraid and unafraid and touch is what life is for you... then this is what I recommend.Ted's Evaluation 3 Worth Watching.";

	schema:headline " Transcendent Love !!!";
	schema:reviewBody "We've seen various riffs on Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' since the release of the said masterpiece in 1954. We've seen Brian De Palma dive further into the voyeuristic core of 'Rear Window' and double down on the sleaziness to show us the dark underbelly of the show business lifestyle in Los Angeles in 'Body Double'. We've seen 'Disturbia' which was a bit of remake of 'Rear Window' specifically made mainly with the teenageyoung adult demographic in mind. But in my opinion out of all the films made subsequently that play around with the inherent 'peeping tom' gimmick of 'Rear Window' the only oneout of the ones I've seen that distinguishes itself and deserves to be called a 'masterpiece' in its own right is Kielowski's 'A Short Film About Love'.The shortened version of the film was used for Episode 6 for the epic miniseries 'Dekalog'. In my opinion both the shortened version as well as this longer film version have their own distinct personalities. The film works as a subversion of conventions as well as a deep exploration of the abstract concept of 'love'. It is a subversion of conventions because we see an immensely sensitive depiction of a young man who is a primarily a peeping tom and he spends his time secretly watching an attractive older woman who lives in the opposite apartment which is inherently creepy. But the twist is that Tomek doesn't do it for sexual stimulation he does it because watching this womanMagda go about her mundane daily routine gives him a different form of stimulation which he describes as 'love'. Once the central surface element of the peeping goes out of the way in the narrative in the 2nd half of the film Kielowski doubles down on the concept of 'love' and starts asking questions through the two central characters Tomek and Magda. Does 'love' have a place to exist in the modern world or is it a thing of the past? Can a romantic connection between two human beings be forged only through sex with eventual orgasms or is there something beyond the desires of the flesh something more transcendent? The film also ends up answering these questions or at least Kielowski gives us a clear indication of his attitude towards the concept of 'love' in his characteristic poetic ways.As I wrote earlier there are various moments of poetry or poetic realism in the film that transcend grounded realistic storytelling. Like the moment where Magda after an argument with one of her lovers spills the milk which Tomek delivered at her doorstep all over her table as Tomek looks on from his apartment room via the telescope. Or the moment of pure joy after Tomek asks Magda out on a dateetc. With the ending Kielowski goes beyond poetic realism and ventures into territories of magical realism but without compromising the humane tender tone of the film. The ending to the film actually is remarkably different to the ending of the shortened episode in 'Dekalog' but they both make the same thematic implication.The acting from the two central actors Olaf Lubaszenko and Grayna Szapoowska is nothing short of special. Their individual scenes as well as the scenes that they share together are incredibly rich with subtlety with pathos and with genuine emotions. Apart from the actors something else that has to be admired for helping Kielowski with the film is the beautiful music and score by Zbigniew Preisner which is rich with a sense of melancholic sweetness.Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "As said in my review of 'A Short Film About Killing' the more work I see of Krzysztof Kieslowski the stronger the feeling that he was an incredibly gifted director responsible for some brilliant work taken from us too soon.Have yet to see anything bad from him with even my least favourite the eighth episode of 'Dekalog' still being very good with the masterful 'Dekalog' and 'Three Colors Red' all three Three Colors films are must watches but especially 'Red' being particularly great. Like 'A Short Film About Killing' was an expansion of Episode 5 of 'Dekalog' 'A Short Film About Love' is an expanded feature length version of Episode 6 to me like Episode 5 one of the best 'Dekalog' episodes.Granted 'A Short Film About Love' is not for everybody and it is easy to understand why. It seems to have been mistaken for a depressing take on romantic love to me while there is love and passion being two of the main themes of Episode 6 of 'Dekalog' it is a more complex and darker interpretation of love but is actually much more than that. Often it is more a film about obsession forgiveness lust and heartache. People may easily dismiss 'A Short Film About Love' as pessimistic and dispassionate perverted has even been used while others find it beautiful haunting and moving. Belong in the latter category myself.Kieslowski's films are all visually striking and exceptionally well made. The same can be said for 'A Short Film About Love'. As well as being beautifully shot with atmospheric use of colour to match the mood it is gritty yet beautiful with many thoughtful and emotionally powerful images lingering long into the memory. Kieslowski's direction is quietly unobtrusive intelligently paced and never too heavy and the music is suitably intricate.The themes and ideals are used to full potential and the characters and their relationships and conflicts feel so real and emotionally resonant without being heavyhanded. Despite being based around one of the ten commandments don't let that put you off resemblance to religion is relatively scant unless anybody argues God's seeming love for sinners. Being a nonreligious person that's not for me to say just mentioning an interesting and quite unusual observation read recently about the film.Storywise it's deliberate in pace but rich and provocative. It's never dull and more often than not it's creepy like Magda being followed out of the postoffice poignant Tomek on the roof Magda in tears after knocking over milk and the heartwrenching fantasy about what life might have been with him. There is even some nice black humour that is so subtle it's easy to miss.'A Short Film About Love's' themes of obsession stalking lust love passion forgiveness and heartache are expertly explored likewise with the characterisations and interactions. The acting is superb as to be expected from both the two leads again the complexity and nuances of the performances is to be admired.Overall another masterpiece from Kieslowski though one of his most divisive. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery or Love Is a Sickness";
	schema:reviewBody "A Polish arthouse director Krzysztof Kieslowski is most well known for his international films La double vie de Vronique 1991 and the Three Colours trilogy White Blue and Red. Kieslowski graduated from dz's film school in Poland from which many directors have started their journey for instance Andrzej Wajda and Krzysztof Zanussi. Krzysztof started by directing documentaries as many do. From documentaries he moved to television films and then to fiction features. Kieslowski is very well known from his TVseries Dekalog 1989 which still is seen as one of the highest achievement of European television. Dekalog is a ten episode long series about The Ten Commandments each episode deals with one commandment. Some might find it odd that an atheist made a TVseries about The Ten Commandments but Kieslowski doesn't approach the subject religiously as he does ethically. Because the Bible and The Ten Commandments have had a huge impact on our conception of what is right and what is wrong. As an entirety the series builds a picture of a modern man facing moral problems.This brief introduction leads us to Kieslowski's film A Short Film About Love Krtki film o milosci. From two episodes of Dekalog Kieslowski decided to make full length films episode five Thou shalt not kill A Short Film About Killing and episode six Thou shalt not commit adultery A Short Film About Love. Both the episode and the film are very interesting. And the perspectives the viewer takes change. When watching the episode one tries to find a bond with the commandment  Thou shalt not commit adultery. But when watching the film one might simply look it as a survey of love in the world we live in.As in all episodes of Dekalog so does A Short Film About Love take place in Polish suburb near Warsaw. Kieslowski tries to build his own world view in this soulless place full of loneliness and selfishness. Kieslowski says in his interview book Kieslowski on Kieslowski that the most interesting thing in this film is perspective the film is divided into three parts. First we see a boy 19yearold Tomek who is stalking a woman. We don't know anything about this woman we only see what Tomek sees. He is disturbing the woman trying to see her and ruin her relationships. Suddenly we see them together for a little while the woman upsets Tomek and Tomek cuts his wrists. Now the third part starts we see everything from the perspective of the woman. She starts to feel pity yearning compassion and love towards Tomek. But the camera never goes to the hospital with Tomek we only see what the woman sees. And in the end the woman looks into the telescope  into herself.When watching A Short Film About Love as a film about the commandment Thou shalt not commit adultery I interpreted it like this. In the film we see a lot of glass windows the glass could be the motive of the film. In the beginning Tomek breaks the window to get inside the warehouse. He also stalks the woman behind his window and sees her behind her window. Also there is a glass shaped like a circle next to the woman's window. To me the glass the window symbolizes the illusion. Magda the woman breaks Tomek's illusion of love by showing that there is no love that there is only sex. Then Tomek breaks Magda's idea of love he breaks her hard shell. When I watched the episode I thought this was the Adultery they committed. They broke the illusion. Thou shalt not commit adultery.But before I had seen Dekalog I had seen the film so then I didn't think about the commandment all I thought was the major subject the relation between love and loneliness. One sees love as a pure beautiful thing but isn't sure how to show it and the other sees love simply as sex she doesn't think that love even exists. The viewer obviously sees that Tomek isn't alright he is sick. He is in love. In our selfish cold and cynical world love can't be anything else except a sickness. A small detail about this is when the godmother is watching Poland's beauty queen contest  is this love in our society?Krzysztof Kieslowski's series Dekalog and all his later films are born from the hands of this amazing trio Kieslowski himself as a writerdirector Krzysztof Piesiewicz as the screenwriter and Zbigniew Preisner as the film score composer. I think Preisner was very important to Kieslowski. His music added a new level of beauty to his films all of us who have seen The Double Life of Veronique know what I mean. Preisner's music is honest true and beautiful just as Kieslowski's films. Another important man in Kieslowski's production was the cinematographer Sawomir Idziak who worked with him in Veronique Blue and Dekalog episode 5 Thou shalt not kill. So Kieslowski's film A Short Film About Love isn't just a new version of Hitchcock's Rear Window it is a picture of a lonely man it's a moral study about our conception of love and also a very beautiful story.".

Outside of working as a clerk in the local post office Tomek's main passion is spying on Magda through his telescope. As shy as he is he is driven by his obsession to establish contact with Magda.I view this movie as more of a parable than as a believable drama. Would Magda leave all of her windows curtainless? Would she not flee her stalker? At first I fluctuated between being made very uncomfortable by Tomel's voyeurism but came to understand that his obsession arose from an immature concept of love as platoniche answers no to Magda's questioning if he wants to kiss her or have sex with her. Magda is coming from the opposite position of feeling that love does not exist only sex. In the intense crucial scene where Magda gently seduces Tomek by merely placing his hands on her thighs Tomek is stimulated to the point of having an orgasm while still fully clothed. This so shatters his concept of love and of himself that he runs away and later attempts suicide.On Magda's side when she comes to understand just how powerfully Tomek felt about her she realizes that her feelings for him have been more than sexual.Had both Tomek and Magda come at their encounter with the idea that love has both platonic and sexual aspects then maybe they could have had something meaningful between them. The movie ends with Magda envisioning what could have been.Zbigniew Preisner's rather sentimental and repetitive score is a bit of a departure from his more commonly operatic formalism but effective nonetheless with the themes reflecting the storyline.".

	schema:headline " Love Through Contradictory Lens";
	schema:reviewBody "A Short Film About Love is a psychological and unconventional love story that urges the viewer to really feel something from the very beginning until the wonderful ending. It's difficult to be impassive to not feel anything about the story of a lonely young man who fell in love with a distant neighbor and whom he peeps at with stolen binoculars. The story is told through the lens of the binoculars from where 19yearold Tomek Olaf Lubaszenko a shy Post Office worker who spies his opposite neighbor Magda Grazyna Szapolowska a very promiscuous woman. In a Hollywood story many people would have thought that he wants to have sex with her and that he's a perverted. But his actions are quite different and he'll always try to find a way to be near her and the way he does this approaches are quite odd disturbing Magda's peace by sending false notices or calling the gas company when she's with another guy at her home. He practically knows everything about her and this obsession gives him a return from the woman who thinks she can play with him just like she does with other guys but things can and will follow through some desperate and sad ways. Writer and Director Krzysztof Kieslowski who wrote the screenplay along with his collaborator Krzysztof Piesiewicz tells us a story about a dry and tedious world who tends to suffocate and destroy the notion of love Magda says to Tomek that she doesn't believe in love and feelings are thrown to the wind by mere acts and the best thing someone can do is just sit and watch things happen just like Tomek does being an observer because to be part of them it might not be so interesting in the way you thought it could be. Themes of loneliness pain emptiness the lack of communication are intertwined in a very peculiar and interesting way. But it's not just sad things there's hope and some funny things too. Perhaps the most positive of the characters is the old lady who lives with Tomek the grandmother of his only friend and she likes the boy very much and wants him to be settled with someone she's the one who really cares about him. She's the most communicative figure in the film and every time she says good things to him about how a girl likes to be treated and other things. In a world where it's more easy to shout and complain about everything than to say I Love You! Tomek finds his way he's a bold character with a awkward way to express what he considers to be love. I really prefer his ideal of what love is than to the concept presented in Atonement for instance great film though. It is a realistic story but at the same time it's not. If the director presents a real world with real situations in one hand on the other he gave us a romantic and cinematic notion of some very fantastic and beautiful things in real life many people would've call the police if they met a obsessive stalker. Instead of that we see a curious woman who wants to know more about this guy. This contradiction works and life itself has many of them. Kieslowski once again made a wonderful movie very calm his camera allows you to see all the details tiny little things that makes a tremendous effect on the story and in the viewer. The slow pace is precisely great to show Tomek's perspective looking inside of Magda's apartment all this presented brilliantly. Kieslowski could tell the whole movie just by showing those images that I would love the film anyway. His direction of actors are very efficient too. To me Olaf Lubaszenko will always be remembered by his portrayal of Tomek wonderful job he really felt the character made him very believable and it's very difficult to resist to his charming puppy eyes. Grazyna Szapolowska is spectacular as well she dominates the second half of the film in a astonishing way when her character realizes what Tomek really felt about her.Art in its best form A Short Film About Love is highly recommended to everyone who enjoys great cinema and philosophical stories. This movie really is gonna make you to have a opinion about it it will prevail in your memory. 1010".

What happens next is what the movie is all about.I chose this movie because I wanted to watch something short in length and this at just 80 minutes of run time qualified easily. However despite fantastic reviews on the net I was not prepared for the sheer emotional power it unleashed.The way the feelings of Tomek and the object of his desire Magda are portrayed is masterly to use a clichd term. The direction by Kieslowski is absolutely God level. The dialogues are kept to a minimum. Kieslowski allows the camera to do the talking. The acting is as natural as they come.I have seen only one other movie by the director which was White one of the troika in the tricolor trilogy. I plan to check them all out ASAP now.This is what movie watchers talk off when they say that cinema can be pure magic.P.S. some of the scenes were copied by that horrific Hindi movie Ek Choti si Love Story. Another reason for me never to forgive Mr. Mahesh Bhatt and his acolytes.".

The movie begins depicting Tomek's attraction towards Magda  his moist eyes finding a man on Magda's flat with his telescope and the movie finishes focusing on Magda her understanding of love  perhaps in the same language Tomek wanted to tell her. The uniqueness of the movie lies in the last scene. Tomek declares to Magda  that he's not spying on her anymore . Magda is surprised at first  apprehends it as Tomek doesn't love her anymore  but the next moment she smiles softly  reassuring herself about the strength of love she came to know in her life.

Cue violins. Survives the attempt and then rejects the shedevil he so previously desired. In an interview on the disc the actress tells how the original ending had the kid coldly repudiate the woman. Very telling this ending because you see he triumphs over her and that'll show you now that you're interested in little old boring me! Or as Groucho said I wouldn't join any club that would have me as a member! Climax!";

	schema:headline " Elysium is visually gorgeous but its story and characters left me cold and disappointed";
	schema:reviewBody "After director Neill Blomkamp's fantastic debut film District 9 I was understandably eager to see his new scifi film Elysium. Unfortunately his second feature doesn't quite match up with the greatness that was District 9.Visually the film is quite stunning and it has some great cinematography when it comes to the larger shots. The CGI effects are excellent and blend in well with the environment. The Earth of the film looks very gritty believable and livedin and the space station Elysium has this very sterile and futuristic look to it. You could really buy it that Earth could look like this with many decades of neglect and poverty. Everything's in disrepair and in decline. The rich on the other hand have every resource available to them in their own little paradise in space. The set and production designers truly did a great job with the locations. Matt Damon is decent as the film's protagonist Max who is an excon now working on assembling the droids which keep order on the now overpopulated Earth. His role and the writing of his character isn't anything too special or memorable but he does what he can with it. He's just a no nonsense guy who is thrown into a difficult situation. He was also quite sarcastic and funny when he was dealing with the droids in the earlier part of the film but we didn't see this side of him at all after that. Alice Braga plays Max's childhood friend Frey with whom Max meets up again when he's an adult. I didn't feel much of an emotional connection or chemistry between them though and that hampered the film a bit. Their back story is told almost completely in sentimental flashback sequences which I didn't care for. The antagonists in this film were very onedimensional and over the top. Jodie Foster plays Elysium's defense minister Delacourt and Sharlto Copley who was also in District 9 plays an undercover agent named Kruger who is positioned on Earth. They're both very clich and uninteresting. The writing of all the characters wasn't very good at all in this film and I didn't get emotionally invested in any of them. The story isn't that great either and this then also takes away from the film's many action sequences because we don't have that big a stake in them. The film starts quite strongly as it juxtaposes the situation on Earth and on Elysium to highlight the problems of social and economic inequality. Then suddenly when the action starts these issues fade far in to the background in favor of more and more action. From the trailers and the hype I really got this impression that the film would deal with these issues in a thoughtful manner. Regrettably this is not the case with this film. A big problem with the film is also that none of the characters seems to learn anything new or change their beliefs or anything like that. A huge part of the success of District 9 was in seeing how the main character evolved after spending some time with the aliens. In Elysium the good guys are the good guys and bad guys are the bad guys. There's no complexity nuance or subtlety in any of them. We also don't get to meet any other citizens of Elysium beside the higher up leaders like defense minister Delacourt and president Patel. It would've been interesting to see the common people of Elysium and how they react to the situation what their beliefs are and what drives them. The writing is also a little too pointed out and heavyhanded. Some of it just made me think Wow really?. For example at one point the CEO of the droid production company literally tells some midlevel manager not to breathe at his direction. Things also seem to happen way too conveniently to push the plot along. Then again you could say this about many films but you really start to pay attention to these things when you're not completely engrossed in the film. This film surely would've benefited from a more subtle approach. The ending was also way too simplistic for my taste.The action in this film is quite intense and it looks very impressive at times. The exoskeletons were fun and looked convincing. Then comes the shaky cam. Oh boy. It's really quite annoying and very often it's hard to see what's going on. They should've really taken a page from the Bourne movies on how to shoot action scenes. Luckily the shaky cam isn't there all the time but the action could've definitely been improved with a clearer shooting style.All in all the film has decent action with absolutely gorgeous visuals and it moves along at a good pace. Sadly the writing the plot and the characters aren't that interesting and it's hard to get emotionally invested in this film. It's watchable and probably quite entertaining if you're in the proper mood for it. For me the film ultimately left me a bit cold and disappointed.".

Elysium hearkens me back to Prometheus directed by Ridley Scott. I would have thought he at least would appreciate the need for a good story to match the visuals. Especially after being the brains behind Bladerunner. But oh no  same thing. I suspect that so much talent and expense is spent on the visuals that insufficient amounts of funding and time are left for the associated story.I just wish that when someone comes up with future plans for making a legitimate SF film sans comic book scenarios they contract a real science fiction author to write the screenplay. There are any number of SF writers out there that can I believe turn out much better scripts than currently making their way to the big screen.Bottom line the world building in Elysium was excellent. Probably some of the best since Avatar. I wish there had been some of this when Bladerunner was produced. As an avid and long time fan of true science fiction I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of the film. As for the story it could have been a lot lot better.".

Even if you can ignore the choppy camerawork that looks like the doings of a toddler with a buffed up camera there's no ignoring the plot. Some examples of the numerous holes in the plot 1 Apparently if a grenade gets blown up inches from your head your brain is still intact and it can be repaired at Elysium. 2 If Carlyle could make the code to make Jodie Foster president then why didn't he just make himself president or give himself all the power by implementing the code himself or subtly adding a nuance in there? Not the sharpest tool in the shed. 3 Where are all the satellites to help track down Matt Damon while he is fleeing the villains? It seems some of the technology 100 years in the future has actually regressed. 4 If the medical terminals can literally give a person a new head through repairing a brain why can't they disable the sociopathic tendencies of characters like Jodie Foster on Elysium? Once again only certain technology has evolved for the director's benefit. 5 In order to let one spaceship enter Elysium you must allow all spaceships to enter too by taking down the nofly zone. That makes total sense. 6 Last but certainly not least the ending. Apparently everyone is going to live happily ever after on Elysium now? Every rich person on Elysium just wanted all those poor people on earth to suffer! But now the world is sugar plums and everyone lives happily! Yay!Secondly there was never any point in the film in which I felt connected to the characters in any matter. Why was this? Well none of them had any depth. The dialogue was one clich after another. The primary villain in the story appears to have some sort of speech impediment because for most of the movie he is inaudible. A welltold story will also have a villain that has deeper complexities as to hisher background and motives. This character was just a bumbling moron. Matt Damon and Jodie Foster did the best that they could but their scripts were so poor that it would have been more interesting had they been reading off the menu at a local Olive Garden. The exchange regarding the hippo between Damon and the little girl that is dying of seizures had me cringing in my seat at the awkwardness of the whole matter. I should have walked out then and there.Also why was the best look we ever got of Elysium one where we saw a few trees and a woman swimming in a pool? Would looking at the inner workings of the politics and lifestyle on Elysium simply have exposed this film for the fraud that it is? I'm not going to go too deeply into the themes of the movie as everyone has their own opinions but it doesn't take much to realize the hidden and rather misguided imo opinion of the director in this one. The message was about as subtle as receiving a ton of bricks to the head. View at your own risk for your blood pressure will likely rise after watching this one as it objectively is a pathetic disgrace of a film.".

	schema:headline " Lacking in Motivation";
	schema:reviewBody "Elysium is the follow up much anticipated by many to the critically acclaimed District 9 from South AfricanCanadian director and writer Neill Blomkamp.In the middle of the 21st Century with the world now grossly overpopulated and law and order seemingly at breaking point the super wealthy have decamped to a satellite space station highly visible from earth a utopian society free of poverty illness and other such mundane woes.Meanwhile the vast majority of earth's population lives in squalid cramped slums seemingly based on the Favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Needless to say the rich are all too keen to protect their enclave and any unauthorised vessels arriving from earth are duly dispatched by being blasted away.Jodie Foster stars as Elysium's ambitious and sociopathic Defence Secretary as ruthless at advancing her own interests as she is at ensuring the purity of the oversized Ferris wheel whose security is in her charge Matt Damon is the working class drone desperately trying to access the other world for the treatment to cure his radiation sickness from which he will die in 5 days.There was clearly an interesting concept waiting to burst out here an opportunity to explore themes of wealth inequality social status health care and immigration but sadly it failed on almost every level to build interest or have anything relevant to say.First we saw so little of the societal structure or way of life on Elysium itself. Apart from Jodie Foster and a few other high ranking officials the film showed us nothing of how this satellite was run. It looked as if everyone lived in a McMansion stylehome  the type you find next to golf courses in Florida or on the Sunshine Coast. It all looked terribly sterile reminiscent of the contrived town Jim Carrey inhabited in The Truman Show. We were not privy as to who cut the lawns did the plumbing or washed the dishes. Superficially the lives of these pampered people seemed hollow and totally unfulfilled  where were the galleries the museums the theatres or even a casino for those that might like that sort of thing? Frankly the impoverished life on earth which was shown with enforced work in a fascistic environment seemed far more fulfilling.Further Matt Damon's motives for getting on Elysium were totally selfish. All he wanted was to save his own skin. Granted there was then concocted an unconvincing love interest and a wish to save his childhood sweetheart's little girl but this too was just parochial. Where was the burning anger borne from social injustice the wish to better the lot of all humankind the working class warrior on a mission? And when the film's final denouement came it was head in a sickbag time.The script and dialogue were banal as was Jodie Foster's delivery.

	onyx:emotionText "Elysium is the follow up much anticipated by many to the critically acclaimed District 9 from South AfricanCanadian director and writer Neill Blomkamp.In the middle of the 21st Century with the world now grossly overpopulated and law and order seemingly at breaking point the super wealthy have decamped to a satellite space station highly visible from earth a utopian society free of poverty illness and other such mundane woes.Meanwhile the vast majority of earth's population lives in squalid cramped slums seemingly based on the Favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Needless to say the rich are all too keen to protect their enclave and any unauthorised vessels arriving from earth are duly dispatched by being blasted away.Jodie Foster stars as Elysium's ambitious and sociopathic Defence Secretary as ruthless at advancing her own interests as she is at ensuring the purity of the oversized Ferris wheel whose security is in her charge Matt Damon is the working class drone desperately trying to access the other world for the treatment to cure his radiation sickness from which he will die in 5 days.There was clearly an interesting concept waiting to burst out here an opportunity to explore themes of wealth inequality social status health care and immigration but sadly it failed on almost every level to build interest or have anything relevant to say.First we saw so little of the societal structure or way of life on Elysium itself. Apart from Jodie Foster and a few other high ranking officials the film showed us nothing of how this satellite was run. It looked as if everyone lived in a McMansion stylehome  the type you find next to golf courses in Florida or on the Sunshine Coast. It all looked terribly sterile reminiscent of the contrived town Jim Carrey inhabited in The Truman Show. We were not privy as to who cut the lawns did the plumbing or washed the dishes. Superficially the lives of these pampered people seemed hollow and totally unfulfilled  where were the galleries the museums the theatres or even a casino for those that might like that sort of thing? Frankly the impoverished life on earth which was shown with enforced work in a fascistic environment seemed far more fulfilling.Further Matt Damon's motives for getting on Elysium were totally selfish. All he wanted was to save his own skin. Granted there was then concocted an unconvincing love interest and a wish to save his childhood sweetheart's little girl but this too was just parochial. Where was the burning anger borne from social injustice the wish to better the lot of all humankind the working class warrior on a mission? And when the film's final denouement came it was head in a sickbag time.The script and dialogue were banal as was Jodie Foster's delivery. Matt Damon worked harder to bring some interest to his character but he was up against it  but at least he tried.The CGI was good  but that's pretty much a given in any wellfunded Hollywood film these days. Close up camera work was appalling nonstop wobble vision which made action sequences confusing.

	schema:reviewBody "Matt Damon stars in the Scifipolitical thriller Elysium Neill Blomkamp's follow up to District 9 along with Jodie Foster as Elysium's Secretary Delacourt and Sharlto Copley as the main villain Kruger. Is Elysium on par with Oscar nominated District 9? Absolutely NOT! Not even close but it is still a solid scifi entertainment. It is a more conventional film than its predecessor which I was not expecting from Blomkamp.The film starts of very clich and gave me some eye roll moments but it quickly picks itself up from reaching into mediocrity. They way it does this is by evoking political messages through out the film in relevance with today's society. Questioning our handling with immigration military power our health care. Which I found to be important in this film. Obviously me and Blomkamp share each others political stance. For anyone else it might seem like its trying to oversell its message.I felt most of the cast were very under used. Jodie Foster's character really didn't have much to work with. She was just there to move the plot forward. Matt Damon served his purpose as the lead but by no means of the imagination is this one of his best performances. They were all over shadowed by Sharlto Copley. My God is he great as Kruger! Right away we are introduced into this provocativesociopath with no regard for human life. The story really needed this kind of menacing character. He is by far the film's best positive. Another negative aspect of this film would be its pacing. When we are given emotional scenes they don't stay long enough to settle and doesn't give that emotional impact you were hoping for.Like District 9 it delivers on the the beautiful imagery. Using the very best Weta Workshop has to offer. From its big guns to the humanlike robots to the space station of Elysium. The action set pieces were just as exciting as its predecessor. The film really manages to capture all its budget on screen. My biggest issue comes from the excessive use of shaky cam. It was used when the characters were simply walking to the action sequences. I felt ninety percent of this film was shaky cam. Which got me a little dizzy since I unfortunately got to sit in the very front of the theater. That might have something to do with it as well.Neill Blomkamp has established once again that he can compete with the best Directors of the genre films. Elysium shows more flaws than his first film but they are overwhelmed by its positive aspects to me at least. It was not a disappointment and it was a solid popcorn entertainment and a smarter than average scifi film.".

	schema:reviewBody "So bad. They don't make you care about ANY of the characters and the storytelling is awful. You barely get to see Elysium it's just like 3 guys in sweaters in a country club drinking champagne for like 5 seconds and there's a little bit of grass and a few trees. Like really? That didn't even look that cool. Spoiler I guess Matt Damon is dying the whole movie from some exposure to radiation and that is the only reason he is trying to go to Elysium. They should have at least made that little girl his secret daughter or something so that you could actually care about him saving her. Her mongoose and hippo story was painful to watch even thought it was the only time Matt Damon and the little girl actually interacted. Kruger the main villain was okay I guess. He had a cool accent and beard but he wasn't that tough or threatening though.It was just some Mexican people on postapocalyptic Los Angeles with no health care and dirty clothes and Matt Damon dying for a few days. Then he gets some techsuit that makes him a tiny bit stronger and he punches like one guy and then nothing happens. They should show people on Elysium freaking out and worrying about people from Earth coming. The people on Elysium did nothing except swim in a pool and sit on a chair.The only cool thing on Elysium was that bed that healed people. I mean couldn't they have a little more cool futuristic stuff? Touchscreens? Cool shirts or sunglasses? More scifi stuff. I mean it is the year 2154 I would think technology would be a lot more advanced. Jodie Foster's control room had like CRT monitors it was so bad. The robot animations and models were well done though.The story and characters weren't developed at all and there was barely any action. I haven't seen District 9 but there's no way it can be as bad as this. I really wanted to like it because the trailer and concept looked awesome. I usually like Matt Damon Jodie Foster and Diego Luna and their acting was fine but this movie could have been so much better if they fixed the story. I felt like Matt Damon didn't really give a crap about helping all the people on Earth and he never even made out with the hot chick...I love the concept surrounding the themes about health care wealth inequality social status and immigration but nothing really tied it all together or developed these themes and this is what was missing. That's what this movie should be about not some guy who is dying and doesn't want to die. It should have been about resistance and inspire you to want to make a difference in the way we currently live.".

	schema:reviewBody "I tend to be curious every time a talented filmmaker gets to direct a film set in a pessimistic futurepostapocalyptic era  visually it's the perfect setting for desolated landscapes and amazing images of urban chaos  storywise it's the perfect occasion to insert social commentary and establish more or less subtle metaphors about our current way of life our current values and extend in a fictitious way many assumptions that we have regarding the fate of mankind and our very own planet. In my opinion it has to be one of sciencefiction's most important subgenres since it leaves so much room to contemporary concerns the environment pollution wars immigration etc.. Films like Children of Men Looper and The Road have greatly contributed to this subgenre which in reality is not really new but is constantly being redefined and given different treatments  Children of Men was an ode to life Looper felt a lot like a modernday western The Road was a classic tale of a fatherandson relationship and now Elysium a thrilleraction filmsocial commentary about disparity between the rich and the poor. Neill Blomkamp burst out of the scene in 2009 with District 9 a very similar project in several regards and blew audiences away with a clever mix of documentarystyle filmmaking explosive action and the refreshing implement of an obvious social commentary.Elysium starts off brilliantly showcasing two opposite environments the old Earth which has turned into a huge ghetto where people live like cattle and Elysium a highend space station where all the wealthy people from Earth have moved to establish their home. We are then introduced to our protagonist Max Da Costa Matt Damon whose quest is quickly defined after being exposed to deadly radiation  With five days left to live Max will ally up with a group of illegal immigrants to get to Elysium so he can get the proper medical attention he needs. But Secretary Rhodes Jodie Foster an evil government executive in charge of defending Elysium will stand in his way by hiring Kruger Sharlto Copley a psychopathic mercenary in charge of neutralizing all illegal immigrants.The first third of Elysium is both fascinating and stressful  You are being introduced to the overpopulated Earth its hospitals its industrial plants its streets. These images are very reminiscent of the Johannesburg ghettos depicted in District 9. And then you get to see glimpses of the wonderful Elysium a visual tourdeforce that ends up being shamefully underused in the film. The first moments Max is shown after being exposed to radiation the film jumps into a nerveracking tone and it is very effective as it is blended with several dramatic elements that range from innovative to pretty common.Unfortunately the pace slows down in the second third where Max's story gets sidelined a bit to the profit of a few subplots that involve an unpredictable yet not so major twist in terms of impact on the story as well as a substory involving the daughter of an old friend of Max. And while the twist is a welcome addition the substory comes a little out of nowhere and comes off as a bit of a clich. It seemed like Blomkamp was trying to preserve this family theme that was dear to him in District 9 and that served the story so well in his previous film. Its unusual aspect prevented it from being too clichd an alien dad and his alien son which is unfortunately not the case in Elysium. It does not ruin the film but it does steal its share of precious screen time in a film that feels a tad too short and leads it towards more conventional developments.Then the pace picks up again with a third act that consists mostly of a bunch of pretty awesome actionfighting sequences where the feeling of urgency from the original quest has pretty much left the building. In terms of writing this is conventional stuff but the technical expertise behind the visuals and the sound is a thing of beauty. Also the dramatic elements displayed in the first third are briefly brought back to seal the deal and do provide a satisfying feeling of closure to the story.Overall this is quality entertainment with impressive visuals and a world of ideas that had infinite potential. And while Elysium exploited only a fraction of its potential what it did exploit it did it successfully. Directing photography music and performances are all superb. With a decent yet a bit unoriginal social commentary in the background that does get shelved in the second half to the profit of rocksolid action sequences the strengths of Elysium taken individually do feel a bit scattered but make for an overall very competent package.".

So ...like a Paul Krugman economic theory...the answer is that the construct exists because the premise starts out saying Let's assume that all logic and common sense goes out the door.!Evidently in the future only future Los Angeles and Elysium exist.

The internet as we know it has also completely vanished. So has email and cell phone technology...but you can still get a good deal on GMC vehicles that look like leftover Road Warrior vehicles! Matt Damon say it Team Americalike works in a factory where he...I guess...builds robots ?. That's a little unclear. But...he is stupidly badgered into some sort of elevator style heattreatment booth by his superior. Since their is no OSHA anymore his character gets trapped in the room where they...get this!...dose the robots WITH HUMAN KILLING RADIATION! Now...there's like no big signs up anywhere in this factory that say WARNING RADIATION AT WORK! It is never explained why robots need radiation treatment but that is what they do. AND...get this!...when the treatment is done the radiation magically disappears! People just walk in and out of the room! Like...WTF!??!!!??? How does radiation magically dissipate or get moved out of a room? IT DOESN'T! Unless all science goes out the window! Poor Matt. Now he has 4 days to live because of Radiation poisoning and he is very ill and can barely walk or stay awake or keep from puking...for about 5 minutes! The rest of the movie he is hooked up to a biometrically controlled exoskeleton and Matt never shows any effects of radiation poisoning and he fights his way all over LA and Elysium! So...in a complete Johnny Mnemonic rip off they should sue...Matt Damon has the magic data in his skull and people want his head. How this all comes about is so incredibly ridiculously stupid and unbelievable I wanted to throw things at the screen.Matt then shows up with a grenade with the pin pulled out and his hand holding the grenade from exploding and he demands a ride to Elysium or he will blow his head off.

The final evil guygood guy fight is just awful. The evil guy basically runs around saying I could kill you but I will continue to spout stupid statements to drag this out until you...and this will be SUCH A SURPRISE...manage to overcome and defeat me because I kept just spouting off at the mouth rather than just killing you! This is after Matt goes to the armory and rescues the girly and Leukemia ridden daughtertug my bleeding heartstrings. Now...dig this...3 bad guys are taking over Elysium...there is a big armory with plenty of weapons...AND NO ONE IS COMING TO GRAB THE WEAPONS AND TO STOP THE 3 MAN COUP OF ELYSIUM!

	schema:headline " No heart in this film";
	schema:reviewBody "I thoroughly enjoyed Neill Blomkamp's previous film District Nine. That film succeeded because of its wellwritten interesting characters uniquely livedin futuristic setting and most importantly its emotional core. Unfortunately Blomkamp's newest project has fallen far short of my expectations. Elysium is utterly dull. In spite of an aesthetic that almost exactly mirrors that of District Nine Elysium lacks the characters or attention to plot details that would have made the movie work. Instead it falls flat in almost every way. Most notable in failure is Jody Foster whose character is insufficiently developed to explain away her perpetual foul mood and allencompassing anger  this is as twodimensional a character as any I've seen. However almost no facet of the movie IS welldeveloped there are several 'emotional' moments in the movie that lack impact simply because the audience is given no time to get to know the characters involved before these important events occur. There's simply no reason for an audience member to care about a character who's only had ten or fifteen lines of generic dialogue in well less than five minutes of screen time.I was irritated that Blomkamp was unable to recapture the emotional connection that made District Nine special to me. While there was clearly a moral message to this movie it was hamfisted in execution and ultimately meaningless. A montage at the very end of the movie's lengthy action finale emphasizes the weight of the choice that our hero made but what's the point of making that choice if the audience must be inundated with recycled footage and clichs to make the connections that are vital to making the moment emotionally meaningful? Blomkamp doesn't seem to have trusted his audience to make these connections and that's the final insult. Elysium is not a smart movie and it doesn't expect its audience to be any smarter. As I walked out of the theater I could remember only one or two names from the whole feature  that alone speaks volumes for how forgettable a film this really is. Elysium tries to hide its lack of heart by battering the audience into thinking it should care... But as in all of the other important areas it falls far short of its goal.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before watching Elysium I read every review about it. And it seems to me that there are a lot of people that hated it. Most have said that the message in the film is what kept it 'likable'. Well after I watched it I thought to myself Why?. Trust me don't believe any negative reviews about this film. Yes it's flawed but the film itself is really good.Matt Damon was great in this film and he was a very likable hero. But Sharlto Copley oh boy he was one heck of a villain. He was so good every scene he was in was disturbing in a very very creepy way. He owned almost every scene he was in and was the stronghold of this film. Jodie Foster as the other antagonist err she did her part I guess. Every one did a good job and they really enabled the film to lighten up in most areas.So this film was really good and I was extremely pleased by it. The film did a nice job for making the audience feel attached to the characters and I applaud to that. The action sequences were nice and it didn't over power the film something Elysium got right and what others sort of didn't. Man Of Steel's epic final battle was just TOO LONG! Also on the scenes where it tones down and becomes emotional was very well done and it gives this movie heart. It's fast epic emotional and incredible.Now although the film is great I only have one small gripe about Elysium. Now the film is around about 109 minutes. I know that when a film feels really good and it begins to near it's end you don't want it to do that just yet. That's how I felt when I saw District 9 and I felt the same with Elysium. The film didn't feel rushed which was nice but an extra half an hour would've been great.Is it a SciFi movie? Yes! Is it an action movie? It gets to it. Is it an epic SciFi action movie? Yes. It is epic! It's definitely a must watch this year. I'm being generous to this film because of the film's message consisting of poverty wealth and equality. Watch this film with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.810".

	schema:headline " Disappointing on so many levels";
	schema:reviewBody "As an avid SciFi fan I was eager to see the last big SF movie of the summer. The trailer seemed exciting and both directorscreenwriter Neill Blomkamp and the main star Mat Damon are big names so I had some expectations not very high mind you. Unfortunately it turned out to be a big disappointment. So let start with the post mortem.The good. This will be a short section. Good special effects both the CGI and the stunts were spectacular. Elysium was great. The cinematography was fine. There were some cool ideas like the exoskeleton not that original but it was well done nonetheless.The bad. Everything else. The plot was a mess the characters were unlikable andor underdeveloped the character motivation was absolutely ridiculous and the character development when there was any was rushed and artificial.The main character Max is not a likable person. All the sympathy I had towards him quickly vanished when he tried to be a smart ass around the robot cops in the beginning of the movie. How stupid you have to be do such a thing when you have a long rap sheet and are still on parole? We are supposed to believe that there was a big love story between Max and his childhood sweetheart and yet they haven't seen each other for decades. He didn't even know she had a kid. The extensive flashbacks to the 10year old Max were nothing more than a diversion from the extremely underdeveloped characters.The boss of the smugglers to Elysium is only interested in money which is fine and realistic but at the middle of the movie he has a sudden and inexplicable change of hart and everything he wants is to help his fellow citizens. Never mind that he practically killed a lot of them taking all of their money for 1 chance to be healed and 99 chance to be killed.All villains are cardboard cutouts without any soul. Maybe this is a consequence of the heavyhanded political propaganda but nonetheless you will rarely find more ridiculous and unbelievable villains. Kruger had hilarious accent and the Jodi Foster was very weak as the tough but extremely transparent and stupid antiimmigration official of Elysium.Now the smaller but still annoying things 1. You have 3 ships that are just few hundred kilometers from Elysium but to take them down you have to call a man on Earth who launches 4 Stinger rockets in space and they fly with something like a 1000 miles per second to strike the ships about 10 to 15 seconds later. Absolutely deranged. Why not launch missiles from the space station itself? Wait I know why! To introduce us to Kruger. Weak weak writing Mr. Blomkamp.2. The atmosphere of Elysium just stands there even though there is nothing above to hold it in place. Well the Moon and Mars are not big enough to hold significant atmosphere with their gravitational field but a space station less than 500 kilometers across is? Would it kill them to have a force field or something to keep the air in place? Again extremely stupid.3. You can be revived 15 minutes after you face is blown by a grenade because your brain is still intact. Still when you are shot in the heart or bleed to dead with severed artery you are beyond saving. Wait what? 4. A man with crappy exoskeleton is tougher than a military robot.5. There are robots everywhere and they seem really capable but the corporations still need lowskilled workers to work on assembly lines doing mundane simple task that even now are done by robots.I can continue but it's really painful. I hope that most of these shortcomings are caused by the need to shove down our throats the simplistic political views of the director because the alternative is to think that District 9 was just plain luck.Compare this BS with the Slumdog millionaire and you will see a movie that effectively carries a social commentary with much better plot characters and message.5 out of 10 stars and I'm extremely generous.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like the extremely overrated District 9 Elysium's lone strength is its convincing special effects and its weaknesses are in every other area. Although there is nothing as terribly stupid as the District 9 alien blood that can bond with human DNA ... and also power spaceships Elysium is heavy handed allegory amped up drama and dramatically ridiculous.Some of the ships and robots are great to look atseeing Syd Mead's name in the credits was not a big surprise.Since the days of Hitchcock people seemed to have forgotten that the first and most important job of a director is not to come up with 'cool visuals' but direct actors. Ergo the title 'director.' So congrats to Blomkamp for showing me the first truly terrible Jodie Foster performance. It's like he showed her a 1960s spiderman cartoon and said 'like this but bigger.' And a lot of her work was dubbed for some reason likely accent inconsistency even though it's still inconsistent in the end product. And i am a HUGE William Fichtner fan but this movie also showcases his career nadir. Sometimes he seems to be imitating Data from Star Trek other times sort of German. And Copley as the villain...well if there is a less menacing accent than this i haven't heard it. And he is of course way way over the top as he was in District 9 though he was decent in Europa Report. Damon is the only performer whose work is credible probably because he's a big enough star to just say no if Blomkamp wants to turn him into a screaming cartoon.In terms of story don't expect any science or anything other than good versus evil. Sadly with rare exception Hollywood science fiction movies are really just noisy action movies these days and as a huge science fiction fan I know i'll rarely see any interesting scientific elements in these though the movies of Duncan Jones and Kosinski do have some smart ideas and are the exceptions. So no Elysium isn't scifi but just heavy handed action movie allegory more or less the same class warfare of District 9 so he's already retreading this theme. Then there is the wouldbe action centerpiece exoskeletal suit an idea that doesn't work at all and isn't well sold visually. Really as designed this thing wouldn't work without tearing off fingers and smashing the limbs of its user which is why most exoskeletal designs are also armor that could shield a waterbased lifeform. In any case the actions scenes are so shaky and over cut it's hard to see what's happening regardless. But I never had even a moment of thinking the thing actually functioned or would function.Blomkamp clearly has a political viewpointone that I have no issue with at all except that it makes his writing too pedantic and monochromatic. A strong viewpoint does not make one a good writer. Writing rich people are bad and poor people are good is not dramatically compelling to watch even if you actually believe things are that simple. Look at the success George RR Martin is having with complex characters...Blomkamp's writing seems like that of a child by comparison. That Elysium is selfimportant and humorless doesn't help.And if Blomkamp who clearly should not write his own movies really understood science fiction the way actual science fiction writers doguys like Greg Egan JMS Ted Chiang Arthur C. Clarke Greg Bear M. John Harrison Stephen Baxter Larry Niven etc. he would not have a future world technology where humans can be rebuilt at an atomic level in the same world as one in which robots fire guns and miss their targets. !!! Robots hitting their targets when they fire is near future and to some extent current rebuilding bodies at an atomic level in less than a minute is very very very far future if ever. But like most Hollywood junkand the similarly stupid crazily overrated breakthrough success District 9 Blomkamp is doing something that looks like science fiction but isn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "ElysiumElysium is at one point disappointing and at the other it is fine. It's a Dystopia which does not look like it could be too far away from the present. The longer you think about it Elyisum already happens everywhere and Neill Blomkamp is a South African native so it becomes clear that the message is about poverty and money in the future. The difficulty making such a future logic and scientifically well is obvious and it is not completely convincing. There lies the main problem of a scifi movie. You make either a starwarsy fairy tale or you have to make it very very believable like the director's much acclaimed District 9. Plotwise it reminded me of WallE which was better Oblivion Escape from NY and some anime type plots . The story was very predictable from the beginning and for my taste it could have been made completely PG 18 in terms of violence to make it darker and more grim. Now it looks a bit indecisive. The actors were fine especially the less known like Copley Luna and Moura. Jodie Foster is great here reminded me a bit of Tilda Swintons performance in Michael Clayton. Matt Damon is a good actor but he's a bit overused lately. In comparison to Pacific Rim it's clear why the audience is more happy with Del Toros skyscraperstyle movie it's pure entertainment reality is far away and the violence is very mild  you hate it or you love it.To sum it up I was well entertained by this. I liked the strong hints of real present problems. I disliked the predictable way the story unfolds the overall mixture of action and violence and some illogic details. I definitely want to see more movies by Blomkamp and so it gets my 7.0.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just what exactly do you expect when you go to see a good Scifi movie? Great visuals? Computer effects? Sure they add a lot to a movie but they are not part of its' soul. However all that big studios do these days is target the 90 of the population and sell crappy plot wrapped in special effects and good reliable clichs like the hero fighting the main villain at the end of the movie scene. But hey why not? That's what makes money. Because 90 of the population  those people who actually think this was a good movie those who are responsible for the tabloid press being the most popular media  those will LOVE this movie. It's about them. About poor uneducated people who overpopulated the Earth and practically destroyed it. They are willing to overlook the laughable plot holes like the one where Foster talks to the Carlyle character. She asks him if he can reboot the system of Elysium and make her a president. And the answer? Of course I can!  Really? Really?! Just like that? Well why didn't you do it earlier than and make yourself a president instead of begging her for new contracts? I agree with other reviews that talk about the weak plot shallow characters and poor acting. However there is one more thing to point out What is the message of this movie? That we are all equal? Cuz the way I see it our hero makes everyone on the Earth a legal citizen of Elysium so that everyone can be cured and they can all thrive under the sun without any diseases and health problems and continue to overpopulate the Earth as before making it even more miserable a place to live. Lets make more cute children and don't think about the consequences. Natural selection people!!!".

The writing was a bit dodgy in some areas but the great acting and effects quickly draw you back into the story. Neil Blomkamp who dazzled audiences with district nine 4 years prior does a fantastic job once again with this flick. His vision made the story very real to movie goers everywhere.

Just as we've finally started getting some good scifi movies produced this thing comes along. And presto scifi gets a bad reputation once again.I'm having trouble deciding which was worse the plot or the camera work. Just kidding. It's the plot! The plot is one dimensional characters we don't care about fighting a war we don't care about. In fact more than once during the movie I was hoping the bad guys would just kill Damon's character. That would put us BOTH out of our misery.The camera work and editing isn't much better and hits a low in the fight scenes. Watching the fight scenes is like trying to watch vegetables being chopped in a food processor. Jump cut jump cut jump cut. Who's winning? Damon? No the zucchini.I won't even try to cover all the failings of the science part of this scifi. There's no way to chronicle the errors and inconsistencies and stay within the 1000 word limit. But here's a tip for future scifi directors If you use a 1950's style circular space station please SPIN it! At least a little bit.

OK Matt Damon and Jodie Foster cannot be brought back to life?? The villain was brought back to life after being dead two hours and half his head cut off! Stupid. I wanted to see more of Elysium. Isn't that why you go to the movies? To escape and be wowed and be privy to a fantasy world?? There was NONE of that. You literally see as much of Elysium as is shown in the trailer. About three quick scenes. No characters are developed on Elysium. There could have been so much fun to show life and technology and decadence but the characters don't even do their fight scenes in the fancy houses they fight in a factory setting! Guess it saved a lot of money on sets! The jittery handheld camera work was bad. No need to edit the scenes since they are blurry and choppy and you can't see what is going on anyway. Matt Damon a kick ass actor who was given nothing. I could care less if he ends up with his leading woman. No real moments just clichs and they had absolutely NO chemistry. She lives in a dump with her daughter and no husband and when hunky Matt Damon asks her out she says NO?? WTF? It sucked and then she tells him her daughter is dying and he walks out the door. Except for a cheesy scene which was like a Hallmark moment. BTW all the cute little girls on Earth were dying of a disease that could only be cured on Elysium. The kids were too cutesy and did not have real personalities. Another complaint is that I truly did NOT want the people of earth to get to Elysium. They were unlikeable. Why is it that they were portrayed as filthy and greasy?? I know plenty of people without money who are nice and clean and neat as a pin. They were criminals and just plain gross. They cannot brush their hair? Matt Damon is the only one who works in his neighborhood? It was like the filmmakers were bigots toward impoverished people to portray them that way. Oh yeah and Matt is exposed to a full dose of radiation at the start of the film and THEN he saves the world? I'm sorry make him have liver failure or cancer or an infection. DO NOT give him acute radiation poisoning and expect us to believe he can carry on have major surgery recover and save the world. Duh. And BTW why would all these criminals let him even come near them when he is contaminated? I also think they should have made the earthlings surgery much cleaner. It was stupid to believe Matt could recover from surgery in that filthy chop shop. His apparatus bolted into his body was ridiculous. It was like two tire pumps screwed into him. The chop shop was another reason to dislike the earthlings. Organization does not cost anything. They could be organized and have lights in their surgery. They have a huge war room with technology so why no lights? They had water and I'm sorry if you are sitting around all day with no day job you can learn how to make your own soap! Jodie Foster did what she could. I wanted to see more of her party her house her life. Would have been so cool to have Matt Damon sneak up there and have an affair with her or something. Now that would have been a good story. Jodie looks absolutely beautiful. Villain was super annoying. He was like spitting out oneliners constantly and I hated him because he was annoying not scary. Another thing they did was make all the houses the criminals earthlings broke into empty. No one was ever in the Elysium houses. Why? Because you did not want to write dialog? Maybe there would be a nice family who would help. It would have been so much more satisfying. It was just so lacking in any personality I feel bad because I think they must have had a limited budget or something so no time spent on the story or scenes of Elysium. It could have been great so it was a lost opportunity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning SPOILERS!! SPOILERS!! SPOILERS!!One illogically plotted moment after another dumb dialog single dimension characters and needlessly pornographic violence don't usually make for a good movie and folks Elysium is no exception. Like many always willing American male agegroupfocused audience members with fifteen bucks to burn for a good Hollywood spectacle I can usually deal with the latter three faults in my summer blockbusters but perhaps unlike those imaginary people when a screenwriter doesn't bother to craft a coherent plot I tend to check out early and start analyzing what's wrong with the script. Maybe I wasn't focusgrouped enough.And so I'm here on IMDb to share my thoughts.Aren't you lucky?Shall we?Elysium like many bad films does not come up with compelling reasons to care about its characters. What do I mean? Flash forward to the finale. This is the critical denouement between the protagonist an excon played by Matt Damon and his loveinterest actress Alice Walker a nurse who also seems to be Matt's exchildhood friend. Matt has battled his way to the heart of Elysium a giant Earthorbiting space habitat whose residents enjoy nearmagical healing technology. This in order to save himself from cancer. Alice's daughter happens to also have cancer in need of Elysium's magic healing. Alice and her daughter are there too. Deep Breath In this scene Matt has to zap his brain to transfer a special computer code to reset Elysium so he the daughter and all other non residents who don't have a special membersonly lasertag branded on their forearms can have lifesaving medical intervention via the futuristic healing machines only located on Elysium yes it's that convoluted.... Matt can't save himself though he will die as a result of the transfer having some kind of weird builtin brain boobytrap. Silliness of this plot aside in a wellcrafted story we might buy in and find satisfaction in Matt's sacrifice for the daughter. But in Elysium this moment falls flat. It feels like an afterthought because there was not a relationship established earlier.Flash back to first and second acts. To establish the bond between these characters we have a brief somewhat romantic scene with kid Matt saying he'll take kid Alice to Elysian some day. This scene is rehashed sporadically throughout the film. We have a shot of one of Matt's tattoos which recalls a moment from that one romantic scene. And we have Matt meeting Alice again as an adult and discovering that she's finally realized her long held dream of becoming a nurse. Here he mentions meekly that it might be great for the two to get back together again. In one other romance setup scene Matt is briefly surprised when he meets Alice's daughter while seeking shelter with Alice when he's on the run from evil Elysium agents. And that's it for relationship building.What else happened with these two? What about the relationship after they were kids? What separated them? How about now? They don't kiss. They don't get back together. They don't seem to even like each other. Matt is focused solely on saving himself. What about the daughter? doesn't she have cancer too? It's telling that Blomkamp can't physically connect Matt Alice and the daughter in the final scene when we're asked to care about their relationship and experience Matt's sacrifice for them. Not much really connects them in the film either. They say their goodbyes via walkietalkie.Rather than focus on a strong central plot like Matt must rescue his love interest's daughter from cancer along with two at most three logically supporting subplots like Matt must destroy Elysium restore love of the exgirlfriend save humanity... the film sets up all its problems as equal Matt Damon has cancer he needs to go to Elysium his exsweetheart's daughter has cancer she needs to go to Elysium all the people of Earth are sick they need to go to Elysium. All the baddies must go down. Each conflict competes to be the central theme of the movie and none win. In a better film Alice and Matt's relationship might be fully explored in the first act. Instead every moment in Elysium we have seems like one of my nine year old son's and then Dad and then Dad and then Dad stories. The only thing missing are the Minecraft references.To be sure the central message of the movie is a good one that we are all equally human and so deserve the same opportunity to have a good life and good heath wherever we may happen to live. It's particularly wellsuited to our contemporary social landscape. But before I can care about this message I need characters I can care about and a story that makes sense too.To like this movie you must believe that on Elysium there's technology that can cure any disease instantly but that for some reason it can't be duplicated on Earth not even partially where fantastic technology also exists just not quite that fantastic.Blomkamp is an amazingly talented visual virtuoso but unfortunately a garage band screenwriter. Please Hollywood hire this genius a good screenwriter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Elysium just isn't as groundbreaking or meaningful as it should be. It's a beautifully shot frantic violent and unfortunately jumbled film somehow made dull by the 'smartest people in the room'. Anyone who has seen District 9 knows how politically charged it is with sweeping themes of classism and racism. As heavyhanded as it is I would have been inclined to dismiss it out of hand. However Neill Blomkamp is a native of South Africa. He's lived through tumultuous times albeit as a youngster in that very part of the world I thought it lent credence to his sermon of a film.I couldn't help but keep those facts in mind the first time I read the plot summary for Elysium. The title even gave me a hint of what was to come 'elysium' was a term in ancient times given to a place like Heaven that was reserved by gods for the favored heroes or a place or state of perfect happiness. I sensed correctly that Blomkamp would bring audiences another morality play masquerading as a science fiction film. Generally that's what makes the best science fiction 'Star Trek' is famous in part for mirroring our current society's issues through the interactions with other intergalactic beings. We have other literary examples of this through Richard Matheson Isaac Asimov and Philip Dick to name a few.I believe Blomkamp and company were on the right track just like the aforementioned authors but there's one thing that separates this story and its' notorious villains from better science fiction ambiguity. There is none. Jodie Foster's character a ruthless defense secretary shows only one motivation keeping illegals out of Elysium. Sharlto Copley's psychotic agentbounty hunter and his pals simply live for the thrill of the hunt. William Fichtner's devious character doesn't think twice about his company's liability after a serious workplace incident. These are all characters without remorse conscience and seemingly without reason. It leads me to wonder how they got that way and why society has made the choice to separate their physical and moral selves from planet Earth and the rest of humanity. To be honest that's far more interesting movie to me than the black and white way this film presents the division of power.We clearly understand the motivations of every earthbound citizen in this film. Earth sucks robot police and parole officers can't sense sarcasm no one can get decent healthcare and to boot everyone on the orbiting space station Elysium lives diseasefree thanks to special medical pods. They have it all 'up there' we don't 'down here' and that's life. So everyone on Earth spends their time risking their lives trying to somehow sneak onto the Wheel In The Sky. I hoped at some point there would be a random reference to the Journey song but alas noThat being the case Elysium is just not the satisfying film it should be. Blomkamp showed an economy to his story in District 9 an intelligence that's lacking this time around especially in the last third of the film. In him I had sensed a rebellious director eager to merge the intelligence of classic scifi principles with the broad capabilities of today's movie technology. With Elysium I sensed a director who got the big budget and wasn't forced to economize his thoughts. His talent is undeniable and I have a sneaking suspicion that his next film will be more focused and rich hopefully while being less frenetic and explosionhappy. Instead of the engrossing and smart journey to Elysium that we should have befitting the effort it took to get there we're treated simply to a shoot 'em up where the gore and violence wins. It just doesn't seem right it's a purpose film perhaps alluding to the disparity between medical technology and affordability in our world but sorely lacking in purpose. If you want a 'splosion film that's smarter than Transformers Elysium might be great for you however as a parable for today's society it's not nearly as enriching and satisfying as it should be.".

You feel for the people on earth. The amazing Elysium itself is drop dead gorgeous and stunning. On that topic the CGI is absolutely extraordinary. Whatever you think of the movie itself you cannot deny how great the visuals are. The droids and ships are literally perfect. Elysium is very tense action packed and emotionally fueled. There are some very iconic scenes that will forever be remembered. Kruger steals the show. You have no idea how good he is until you see this. He's amazing in a very strange way. Damon fitchner and foster are all amazing and serve up excellent performances.Overall this movie is so entertaining and will most likely be misunderstood by some viewers who want a more cheerful and kid friendly movie. This is a very adult themed movie and packs in a lot of violence. It's utterly satisfying and i would be shocked if its not a classic in a couple of years".

	schema:reviewBody "Step Up 3D maybe the best 3D movie since Avatar. You laugh. For one thing Step Up 3D was filmed in 3Dno post production enhancement. Seeing amazing street dancing is visually stunning in 3D. One distinguishing sequence has Moose Adam G. Sevani splashing his moves on the water flooded stage. In another electrifying sequence the dance troop Pirates move in unison in LED lit costumes. One sees Step Up 3D for the 3Dentirely.No ground breaking storytelling here. Amy Anderson and Emily Meyer's screenplay barely eclipses perfunctory. This is the coming of age story of misunderstood young people overcoming the odds to compete in the First Annual World Dance Jam. The dialogue is awful. We endure the speaking interludes throughout the movie to get to the dancing which is spectacular. Director Jon Chu has a dramatic sense of line and chaos with a provocative and flourishing visual style.The dancing is spectacular. Jon Chu has assembled some of the best street dancers in the world. The Santiago Twin spirited Martin and Facundo Lombard just kill in the World Dance Jam. Chadd Smith as Vlad whose specialty is the Robot dance is absolutely awesomein 3D the effect is mesmerizing. Sharni Vinson who plays stunningly beautiful and ripped nomad street dancer Natalie is elevation and grace combined. The capoeira practice she performs with Luke cool and handsome Rick Malambri is high velocity precision. Chu is also a student of the classic musical. He films an homage to Singing in the Rain in a single take with Moose and his almost girlfriend Camile Alyson Stoner as they duet down the street. Chu also provides such visual texture and touch in the World Dance Jam itself mixing the Wushu influenced Asian street dancers along with the breakers and the poppers.Even with the corny dialogue and lame story lines the opening sequence gets it right. Luke Malambri runs a shelter and dance studio for down and out street dancers his parents' legacy. Luke's passion is filmmaking. As the movie opens we see Luke film interviews with his dancers. This wonderfully captures that dancers are never more present to life or have more joy than when they are dancing. Authentic passion transcends the written words and is inspired. In a roundabout way Step Up 3D is at its best when it is in the moment in 3D Otherwise we are left with that Moose is too stupid albeit a brilliant engineering student to see that Camile is in love with him and that he really loves her. Mysterious Natalie may not be who she appears and that she and Luke are falling for each other. And does anyone really take a train to Los Angeles from New York? We kind of know the answers to these questions. So what there is to do is enjoy the dancing.".

Amy Anderson and Emily Meyer's screenplay barely eclipses perfunctory. This is the coming of age story of misunderstood young people overcoming the odds to compete in the First Annual World Dance Jam. The dialogue is awful. We endure the speaking interludes throughout the movie to get to the dancing which is spectacular. Director Jon Chu has a dramatic sense of line and chaos with a provocative and flourishing visual style.The dancing is spectacular. Jon Chu has assembled some of the best street dancers in the world. The Santiago Twin spirited Martin and Facundo Lombard just kill in the World Dance Jam. Chadd Smith as Vlad whose specialty is the Robot dance is absolutely awesomein 3D the effect is mesmerizing. Sharni Vinson who plays stunningly beautiful and ripped nomad street dancer Natalie is elevation and grace combined. The capoeira practice she performs with Luke cool and handsome Rick Malambri is high velocity precision. Chu is also a student of the classic musical. He films an homage to Singing in the Rain in a single take with Moose and his almost girlfriend Camile Alyson Stoner as they duet down the street. Chu also provides such visual texture and touch in the World Dance Jam itself mixing the Wushu influenced Asian street dancers along with the breakers and the poppers.Even with the corny dialogue and lame story lines the opening sequence gets it right. Luke Malambri runs a shelter and dance studio for down and out street dancers his parents' legacy. Luke's passion is filmmaking. As the movie opens we see Luke film interviews with his dancers. This wonderfully captures that dancers are never more present to life or have more joy than when they are dancing. Authentic passion transcends the written words and is inspired. In a roundabout way Step Up 3D is at its best when it is in the moment in 3D Otherwise we are left with that Moose is too stupid albeit a brilliant engineering student to see that Camile is in love with him and that he really loves her. Mysterious Natalie may not be who she appears and that she and Luke are falling for each other. And does anyone really take a train to Los Angeles from New York? We kind of know the answers to these questions. So what there is to do is enjoy the dancing.";

I compare this toYou Got Served which received a much lower score on IMDb than this though it shared an extremely similar story though it portrayed a lot more emotion and overall focused more on the characters than the dancing.

Step Up 3D is all about dancing it offers you sick moves and superb visuals. And well in my point of view even though the plot has some holes and is predictable it is actually works well enough.The beginning scene gets it moving. Why do you dance? To express. Because we can be someone amazing when we move. So in the movie we got astonishing dancers outstanding choreography and so much color and visuals that its really a great watch especially in 3D. And 3D works very well for this film. Just... when you see the choreography how can you not love the movie? Its just sick. Some of the scenes are brilliant watch out for the one briefly seen in the trailer when Moose and Camille are dancing through the city. That scene steals the show.Well Moose played by Adam G. Sevani is the best character in the movie. He is believable can act and is the only one with any character development. He also has pretty good charisma that makes him interesting to watch and is quite funny. We also have some of the best and i really mean the best dancers from all around the world starting with bboys and finishing with the finalists of SYTYCD. And all the other ones. And as a dancer i had to pick up my dropped jaw from the floor after the movie. Did i mention awesome dancing?So this movie is made for specific audience and as for it isn't for everyone. Dancers are going to love this. We'll always have those who will bash this movie and see it as the worst ever made but they're just haters. If you're up for some insanity on the dancefloor colorness and excitement watch Step Up 3D. It will blow your mind off and take the roof with it. I like.".

Adam and Alyson's road dance was one of the sweetest dance performance I've ever seen. Stunning looking Sharni Vinson danced really well and in some scenes she acted quite well. Gorgeous Boy Rick Malambri was the weakest Actor and Dancer among them all. His dancing with Sharni Vinson was great but in whole group he was the weakest link. Sadly he had no expressions on his face whether he is serious sad happy or funny he had the same expressions except when he Smiles. I think he got this job because of his looks because he is a terrible actor. One thing besides his good looks saved him was his awesome chemistry with Sharni Vinson. All the other dancers were great in dancing and terrible in acting. Overall its highly enjoyable because of its Incredible dance routines so if we forget the terrible acting by most of them its pretty good.".

I hate wearing the glasses unless I'm on a ride at Disney. I feel like a lot of the films that employ 3D technology also release a 2D version a good thing for people like me. I wish Step Up 3D would have given the option even if the name denotes the extra dimension. As for the cast I was disappointed in the male lead but not because of his acting or looks. He is beautiful and can act. However he apparently can't dance. I felt like if he was going to stand on the sidelines during battles or have obvious doubles they could have played him even heavier as the director. Moose and Camille pulled off what could have been an impossibility tying the first and second film together with the third in a realistic manner. Unlike Channing Tatum's cameo to tie the first and second films together making Moose and Camille besties going to college together was brilliant. The soundtrack is great even though some of the songs you'll recognized from other recent shows Glee and Sex and the City. All in all I enjoyed the movie and left the theater wanting to dance. The film like any self respecting franchise leaves it wide open for a fourth. A word of advice make like The Fast and the Furious and wait 'til you're missed and can get the entire cast together to go for 4.".

And the 3D aspects of the film is done pretty well and was a lot of fun to watch. The past two movies is better when it comes to the plot but still boring and I couldn't careless about it in this. Since it is mostly ridiculous but it's just really ridiculous this time around. But if you want to see a dance flick with cool dancing in it go check this movie out. I am also really glad Moose makes a comeback in this the kid is one cool nerd and the kid can really freaking dance. Overall although the plot is laughably ridiculous the dancing and the 3D aspects of it was a ton of fun to watch. Would have been even more entertaining if it had more dancing competitions in it.710".

Now onto the directing editing and general theme it's bad It's like the creators got together and said let's make a movie based version of Britain's got talent with only the dancing parts and more dramatic and took it from there. Now the acting if you can call it that is just terrible now I know some people are saying to themselves hey we're not watching this for the acting etc just wanna see some dancing well if that's the case the go to a dance show because that's all this movie is but more glam and dramatic. Acting generally makes a film obviously directing etc comes into play but usually if the acting is terrible then so is the film and that's exactly what this film is  the even funnier thing about this film they try too hard to make dancing seem like a mysterious force that is essential and way of life which leads you into wisdom etc yeah right! it's an artform an expression etc but that's it. I could literally moan about this film until I'm blue in the face but I will stop now and let you judge and if you have a few brain cells you'll just learn from my experience and pass on this film because it's simply crap.".

His flashy and somewhat tedious dance moves DO NOT make up for his complete and utter inability to act or be funny when his character is supposed to be the sort of quirky friend.

	schema:reviewBody "New York's intense street dancing underground comes alive in eyepopping Digital 3D in the third installment of the Step Up franchise as the raw passionfueled culture goes global. A tightknit group of street dancers including Luke and Natalie team up with NYU freshman Moose and find themselves pitted against the world's best breakdancers in a highstakes showdown that will change their lives forever. Touchstone PicturesLet's face it By now nobody goes to a STEP UP movie expecting plot and character development. If you do I will personally go up to your front door and slap you in the face. The plot is so predictable that the only way you don't know what's coming is that this is the first film you've ever seen. However that's not necessarily a bad thing. The sequels in this franchise never take itself too seriously. In fact you can tell in this film that the clichd plot was just an excuse to showcase some of the best dance sequences you will ever see in your life. The filmmakers know it's all BS. The audience knows it's all BS. You just go along with the ride.The first film featured a highly idiotic soap opera that really didn't work for me. The sequel however was considerably more energetic and fun in almost every way. Jon Chu returns to the director's chair since STEP UP 2 and steps everything up see what I did there? on a whole new level. It has two things going for it The crazy dance moves and 3D. And because of that the film is totally worth watching in theaters. It's a visual feast and the songs are footpopping fun!Hey you laugh now thinking Does a movie like this really need to be in 3D? Let's be honest here Does ANY movie have to be in 3D? No but studios make them in 3D anyway. STEP UP 3D utilizes the 3D technology in the best possible way since AVATAR. You read it right. The 3D was AHMAZEING. From the opening studio logos to the end credits your jaw will remain dropped. THIS is how you make a 3D movie. THIS is what 3D was made for. I can't believe it took a STEP UP movie to show studios out there how 3D should be utilize because this is why 3D was made in the first place. The true potential of this technology is used in the dance sequences. Wow oh wow. No mere words can describe the awesomeness of it all. More on that later. The technology is used in a gimmicky fun sense and to project a depth in many scenes. The 3D is so good that I already spent one huge paragraph writing about it.The dance sequences are also insanely unreal. There comes a point where characters even defy gravity! How awesome is that?! And although new hiphop moves are the main focus in the film there are many other styles of dance that will appeal to every demographic including a wonderful tango scene and a Singin' in the Rainesquire tribute paying homage to the classic musicals in the past in all one shot nonetheless.The castmembers are efficient enough although nothing to scream about. Rick Malambri and Sharni Vinson are sweet and believable in their roles. However Adam G. Sevani and Alyson Stoner take the cake. Sevani returns from the second film and he's just a likable actor. It's hard to hate him. Stoner returns from the first film in which she was a little kid! Sevani and Stoner have chemistry and their scenes in the film are just really sweet. However my favorite characters in the film are the twins Martn and Facundo Lombard. You'll see why once you see the film. There are also some surprise cameos here that I dare won't spoil because it would ruin the fun.So overall it all boils down to this Are you the person who's willing to shell out 10 to see this film in 3D just for the dance moves? If not don't see the film. If you're a person who wants to see a plot and some great character development don't see the film. However if you just want to have a good time at the movies STEP UP 3D delivers in every way. It's a highly energetic film that is so persistent in trying to wow the audience with fantastic dance moves. On top of that it's one of the very few films out there that utilizes the 3D technology so well that it should be seen in 3D. STEP UP 3D is a cinematic experience.".

	schema:headline " Let Me Put It This Way You Will Not Be Disappointed";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm still not certain the Step Up films take place in the real world. Dance is so important to the characters that inhabit this plane of reality that I barely recognize it. Is every move a metaphor? Battling surely seems a surrogate for a fistfight while love is manifested with more delicate gymnastics. Context regardless the seriousness with which they approach their art is unshakable. Conversely as someone who finds their rhythmic jiving inherently silly Yes I saw Step Up 3D ironically. My recommendation however is anything but.I honestly can't imagine it disappointing anyone. If you're a fan in any capacity of the previous two films well you're in for a treat. Part three was shot in 3D as opposed to converted postproduction and looks terrific. The image depth is deep and convincing and even when the effect is applied as a gimmick its exactly what a film like this needs. The plot revolves around a series of escalating danceoffs and I can't see the ridiculousness of some of these sequences having the same impact flattened. The cinematography is clearly built with glasses in mind see it in 3D or don't see it.That may seem a rash proclamation especially for those who really haven't come around on 3D yet. But as with Cameron's Avatar the quality differential between those films conceived and designed for the medium and those that tack it on in the eleventh hour is vast.

	onyx:emotionText "I'm still not certain the Step Up films take place in the real world. Dance is so important to the characters that inhabit this plane of reality that I barely recognize it. Is every move a metaphor? Battling surely seems a surrogate for a fistfight while love is manifested with more delicate gymnastics. Context regardless the seriousness with which they approach their art is unshakable. Conversely as someone who finds their rhythmic jiving inherently silly Yes I saw Step Up 3D ironically. My recommendation however is anything but.I honestly can't imagine it disappointing anyone. If you're a fan in any capacity of the previous two films well you're in for a treat. Part three was shot in 3D as opposed to converted postproduction and looks terrific. The image depth is deep and convincing and even when the effect is applied as a gimmick its exactly what a film like this needs. The plot revolves around a series of escalating danceoffs and I can't see the ridiculousness of some of these sequences having the same impact flattened. The cinematography is clearly built with glasses in mind see it in 3D or don't see it.That may seem a rash proclamation especially for those who really haven't come around on 3D yet. But as with Cameron's Avatar the quality differential between those films conceived and designed for the medium and those that tack it on in the eleventh hour is vast.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie at a screening and really enjoyed it. The 3d aspect is done quite well with the in your face dance moves and dance effects. However I can't help but get the feeling that it wasn't done to its full potential and I'm sure the sequel to this movie will remedy that. I don't think the dance moves were choreographed with 3d in mind but I'm sure this will be realized in later movies as well. But what is done here is really something I've never seen before. The plots and subplots are good enough to drive the story forward but not too overbearing to take anything away from the dancing. The only problem that I felt was that from the vast pool of supporting cast and dancers the story focuses squarely on the lead.A lot of reviewers on IMDb talk about quality of acting and directing but I'm not knowledgeable enough in those things to comment about them. Nor am I too knowledgeable about dance moves. However as an average viewer I did see some martial arts and parkour influences. Apart from that I had no idea why someone was winning a competition or what the rules were but as you'd expect the dance aspects were really well performed and presented. The movie takes dancing and competitions very seriously and it never falls into unintentionally funny moments which is quite a feat since the dance genre is so heavily parodied.The other uncomfortable aspect was the product placement and brand splashing. I suppose a lot of movies are doing this to help out the budgeting but when characters start sprouting about some brand of shoes or when the underground dance competition has a huge product banner on the wall it really hurts the movie since it pulls you out of their world and you realize you're in a cinema and you're watching an advertisement or product placement.Overall the movie is enjoyable and the 3d aspects are a prelude to what is possible with this genre and 3d technology. The cast is young and vibrant though all I've never seen them in another movie before. The dancing is presented really well here and this is an enjoyable movie.".

They think they've found the answer to winning in Moose and Sarah who comes to this club numerous times and is convinced to join their crew in winning the tournament. The previews make it seem like Sarah is the main character in this film but she is not. She is only part of the big twist and does not really do much for the film. The dancing in this film is good but seems computer generated at times. The use of 3D makes the film work as it makes the dance sequences seem very cool.

Not only that it has surpassed the previous Step Ups by FAR in terms of dancing. But really that's what these movies are made for right? To watch the DANCING! I also really enjoyed the cast in this movie as well since there's a lot of familiar faces from the dance community and So You Think You Can Dance. Everyone is a dancer in this movie and if you already can't tell how awed I am still the dancing in this movie is so good that it makes the acting and plot both of which are actually better than Step Up 2's negligible. Since this movie is in 3D after all I really must emphasize that the visual effects that are put into this movie to combine with the dancing make the overall movie experience and film quality a lot more worthy.Needless to say my movie experience was continuously EXCITING because it seemed like I couldn't stop squealing saying That is SO. AWESOME. or just having my jaw drop once the dancing started. I promise you it will blow your mind the heights to which dancing is showcased in Step Up 3D.Step Up 3D may have 4.1 stars on IMDb right now but I am a viewer whose intent was to appreciate the heart and soul of the movie  the dancing. After you see it you'll wish there were more stars to give for Step Up 3D's performances.".

The opening sequence using vintage lowriders in a traffic jam is spectacular a muscular routine using very physical dance and very physical automobiles for an enjoyable fusion of art and pop culture.Look this is not Flashdance or Dirty Dancing and Emily Kathryn McCormick is not Jennifer Beals nor is Sean Ryan Guzman Patrick Swayze or Channing Tatum from the first installment but they are attractive performers given simple dialogue but dynamic modern film dancing that uses creative camera angles and minimal CGI to tell a pleasant formulaic story. In other words I was entertained by the dancing and found the screenplay clichd.Emily's dad Mr. Anderson Peter Gallagher the only true actor in the lot plans to build a giant complex right in the hood of the dancers a place romanticized for the purposes of the story but in reality a poor wharf community. The Mob along with Emily fights to preserve the area using flash mob to tell their story to the city to stop the construction. The set pieces are uniformly exciting and executed with such energy as to evoke the passions of youth and protest.The story and the dialogue are pedestrian but that dancing is so magnetic that I might go back and see the first three films in the series and maybe Footloose and maybe even West Side story and Strictly Ballroom.If for nothing else Step Up Revolution keeps alive the romantic dance movie genre with some steps even Fred Astaire wouldn't recognize.

The story is about a group of dancers called The Mob which performs flash mobs all over the city of Miami. In order to win a YouTube contest with a grand prize each of their performances are filmed and put online to get the most views that they possibly can receive.Sean Guzman first meets Emily McCormick at a party and she eventually joins The Mob. However they soon find out that some successful businessman is planning to tear down The Mob members' neighborhood. This businessman just happens to be Emily's father. Didn't see that one comingThe rest of the movie involves The Mob using their talents to protest and win their neighborhood back while Emily is conflicted between her father and her new crew.My expectations were pretty low going in but somehow this movie is even worse than I had expected. Yes the dancing is incredible and the choreography is quite inventive but it doesn't make up for the awful acting and overly familiar story. Kathryn McCormick and Ryan Guzman had no chemistry nor do they have much of an acting background. The plot is extremely predictable and the script is as cheesy as it gets.The only enjoyable scenes are those that involve dancing. The rest is tough to sit through. There are a few cameos in an attempt to somehow connect the fourth Step Up to the previous two which was a nice surprise.If you loved Step Up 2 The Streets and Step Up 3D I'm sure you'll love this one too. It's incomparable to the first Step Up which is less of a 'dance movie' and more of a movie that includes dance within it.I give Step Up Revolution a 4 out of 10. If it weren't for the amazing dancing I'd give it a 1.".

The story line of this movie is terrible and completely unrealistic. I understand it is a dance movie but to think that dancing this is going to make some monumental difference in society is ridiculous. Also to make it as though they are facing having to serve hard time in the Big House for dancing around just comes off as dumb. It drives me crazy to watch movies like this that try to pull off some sort of profound message but fail miserably. It is sad to think about all the young boys and girls out there who will grow up idealizing movies like this. These movies should stick to dancing and leave the messages to serious movie makers. If you feel the need to watch this movie I recommend saving yourself time and just fast forward to the dance scenes.".

With the exception of the first installment which although starred a young sexy Channing Tatum in his first lead role took it self way too seriously to be entertaining. And thats a huge reason why these films work because from it's superior sequel best of the franchise and one of the best dance movies ever made Step Up 2 The Streets the movies have found this odd balance off fiery kinetic dancing likable personalities overly melodramatic and unintentionally funny performances ferocious cinematography and hammy storytelling that just works. You laugh you clap and sometimes you tear up at the clichd and expected finale. This entry fares better than the last which was still pretty damn good. It centers on The Mob a dance group of struggling artists looking to make their mark on pop culture by staging creative dance mobs so that they can get 10000000 views on you tube and get a hefty 100000 prize. which split between the 50 person team isn't very much but I'll let it pass. Anyways he comes in contact with another struggling young dancer whose well not very struggling since her Daddy is a billionaire whose looking to tear down the middlepoor class neighborhood they live in and make it into a huge resort. Enter the film's interestingly semi fleshed out plot as they decide to change their flash mobs from breezy dance numbers to ones with meaning as they protest The Man so to speak. Of course their is some third act drama to cause a downward spiral before wrapping it up in the films inspired finale which was in fact inspired by the classic film The Warriors. The dancing is amazing and for the first time in the series they incorporate different styles of dance such as contemporary and modern to successfully winning measures. Kathryn McCormick of So you think you can dance has some crazy sizzle in the lead when it comes to her dancing but her acting is well questionable in the essence of I'm not actually sure that's what she's doing. Slightly more successful and way hotter is MMA fighter Ryan Guzman as the film's thankfully mostly shirtless leading man. He's got the body of a Greek god and the talent when it comes to dancing but hey let's just leave the acting out of this equation. You know there's a problem when the film's best performance dramatically is from Peter Gallagher as her over bearing greedy Father. And watching the two of them together trying to force some type of connection is akin to watching erasers on a desk facing each other. That being said they are hot and very talented when dancing. And when they are it's fire. And thats basically the film as with the other installments when they try for the drama it's unintentionally funny and it works in a so bad it's good way but when they perform you see the kinetic addictive energy that makes these films so endearing. 45".

	schema:reviewBody "When the original Step Up film debuted it was a surprise hit and gave the world Channing Tatum but no one ever thought it would become a franchise. After two successful sequels it comes as no shock that they decided to churn out another one with Step Up Revolution. Much like the second film in the series they once again changed up the cast but also the direction of the dancing itself. Could this latest entry be as entertaining as the previous films or will it be the one that finally closes the curtain? Step Up Revolution follows a girl aspiring to be a professional dancer who falls in love with the leader of a flash mob dance crew. When a wealthy business man threatens to build a hotel in the neighborhood of the crew they must work together to use their dance as protest art to try and stop him. If this story sounds familiar it should it was pretty much the same story from Breakin 2 Electric Boogaloo with just some minor changes. The previous films in this series managed to stay pretty entertaining even without Tatum thanks to the great dance sequences and the likable talented Adam Sevani who played Moose. Sadly he has taken a very distant back seat to this latest edition to the franchise. The cast leading this movie seem to really struggle trying to make this work. There is no chemistry between anyone and their performances were subpar at best. In reality though the dance is what people come to see in these films and usually can make up for that but here even most of that is a bit off. Even with a rehash of a story that's been done hundreds of times the thought of the flash mob dancing is a good one but just not executed all that well. With the exception of the opening sequence and the final sequence the rest of the performances not only come off not all that entertaining but even more so unbelievable. The majority of this film lives in the land of make believe and has no way of making the viewer believe that they could pull off what they did.This is easily the weakest edition to this franchise with little to no redeeming quality. It's not the worst film ever made or anything and some fans of the franchise are sure to enjoy it but just doesn't work. The end sequence while also not being all that believable to pull off in the time they supposedly did it still manages to entertain thanks mostly to some not so surprising fan favorites.httpwww.examiner.commovieindallasbobbyblakey".

	schema:reviewBody "Emily arrives in Miami with aspirations of becoming a professional dancer and soon falls in love with Sean a young man who leads a dance crew in elaborate cuttingedge flash mobs called The Mob. When a wealthy business man threatens to develop The Mob's historic neighborhood and displace thousands of people Emily must band together with Sean and The Mob to turn their performance art into protest art and risk losing their dreams to fight for a greater cause.  C SummitAs I was waiting in line to see this film a boy about 7 was with his mother. He explained to her about all the dancers that were in the previous STEP UP films and seemed to have an extensive and indepth knowledge about these dancers that I could never compete with. I suppose that these films are geared toward people like the boy I overheard those who surround themselves in an art form with many styles. I don't watch shows like SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE but there is something endearing about the STEP UP films excluding the first that separate themselves from other dance flicks. First and foremost they don't take themselves seriously. Their predictable story lines are an excuse to showcase some mad dance moves that you'll never get to see in life. These films know that they aren't high art so comparing them to something like THE GODFATHER is entirely missing the point.However like everything else the STEP UP franchise will eventually lose its luster. This is the case with REVOLUTION as with most franchises that suffer from sequelitis. REVOLUTION is entertaining for what it's worth but it isn't as exciting to watch as the previous two entries. The film lacks the charm of its two predecessors mostly due to the lack of the lovable Moose who only appears in a short cameo. Regardless the dancing sequences are top notch and filled with wonder and creativity. There's also an added twist concerning protest art which was interesting. One sequence in particular is sure to wow the audience taking place in an art museum where the art literally comes to life. There's also the obligatory 10 minute dance in the climax that is just as good. However I must note that another dance sequence will likely disturb people particularly because of the recent movie theater shooting in Colorado. It involves smoke grenades people being covered in gas masks and armor and gun shot sound effects. In and of itself the scene is supposed to be alarming but the added tragedy just makes it illtimed.Like STEP UP 3 the film takes full advantage of its 3D technology from the opening scene to the end credits. There's a lot of gimmicky pop out moments but scenes with amazing depth as well. These films prove to be some of very few films that know how to use 3D well and makes one wonder if other filmmakers should have to learn from these guys. The story is also interesting as the film tackles on the current issue of the Occupy movement done with flashmobs. Lastly the actors can surely dance but their performances are merely sufficient.If you like the STEP UP films there's no reason you won't enjoy this one. The dance sequences and 3D are great but it's forgettable once the credits roll. Additionally I hope the filmmakers stop the franchise at this one because it's starting to get stale and repetitive. On another note I would like to indicate that director Scott Speer directed some episodes from the web series THE LEGION OF EXTRAORDINARY DANCERS LXD created by Jon Chu which I highly recommend to watch as it provides a great alternative to your usual dance flicks think THE AVENGERS but with dancing. It's not as bad as it sounds. Trust me.".

I think I should start with casting. While the cast did deliver in terms of body type and dance ability I found it hard to believe any small percentage of acting that went on. Furthermore I do believe I saw the actress who played Emily on an episode of CSI once. She was playing a corpse. That being said I was surprised to see her reprise her role. With almost no facial expression and little more in terms of vocals I was astounded by the love connection made between her and Sean it was incredibly unbelievable. Speaking of he probably should have just left his shirt off. Seriously you could cut glass with those babies. It occurred to me somewhere between the first and third use of clichs that that was probably too many I know that it must be difficult trying to figure out new ways to rework the old material so that little to no effort needs to be put in but please. The dialogue left much to be desired and I really had no idea who the characters even were. Honestly the only way I knew the characters names was through this site which I visited immediately after viewing. I'm also pretty sure that while public disturbance is punished with a small amount of jail time street dancing is only dangerous to your joints. Watch out for that bursitis. I would also like to address the point of the 2 in this movie no not poop the lackey. I'm not willing to put the effort in of checking his character name so I will refer to him as 2. I would like to draw attention to the fact that the MAJOR problem 2 had with that Anderson guy was the fact that he fired him FOR A LEGITIMATE REASON. I'm not sure what jobs 2 has worked in the past but I'm pretty sure noone is cool with an employee who is 20 minutes late to a major staff meeting. All in all the movie had one redeeming factor the dance instructor. I'm not sure where they found someone with such breathtakingly beautiful Kate Goselin hair or acting chops worthy of the London stage but well done. I'm not sure which part I was more enthralled with the part where she nearly molested Emily or the part where she... oh wait that was all the time. To be fair I'm not privy to a lot of the details of their relationship but I am fairly certain that it is not close enough to elicit calling Emily Babydoll. Babybear perhaps but not babydoll. I don't want to put you through much more of this so I will leave you with this thought NEVER is it OK to put swelling orchestral themes at the end of a movie in which the deepest moment is when GOTYE must explain his name to a stiff businessman. But the dancing was good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having performed Contemporary with the Frankston Ballet Company for over 15 years I was blown away by this stunning portrayal of dance pronounced Darnce and the impact it can have in both social and political spheres.This film follows a crew called The Mob who are using Flash Mobs to gain Hits on The Youtube to win a large cash prize. However when a large property consortium threatens to build condominiums over their historic and ethnically diverse neighborhood The Mob focuses their art toward social awareness and protest.The plot thickens as the property magnates daughter Emily joins the mob in an act of rebellion.

Jealousy angst and betrayal ensue fracturing friendships relationships and bringing a community to its knees.For a large portion of the film I was gravely concerned for the fate of our two protagonists a modern day Romeo and Juliet whose love was being asphyxiated by an unforgiving father and a jealous friend. Could the power of dance truly overcome corporate greed and male machismo? SPOILER ALERT Yes.The power of dance can overcome anything. In a beautiful finale The Mob reforms to reform the town's attitude  and that of the developers  to stop them from destroying beautiful historic Miami. And as our young lovers perform a beautiful bump 'n grind in front of him even developer dad realizes the error of his ways.I have seen and heard of similar tales from all over the world From Baltimore all the way to New York where dance overwhelms the mind body and soul and allows the evil powers of rational decision making to be overcome by the beauty of beauty.My only criticism is that this film is for the most part too realistic. .".

	schema:headline " Flashy Moves Predictable Story Line";
	schema:reviewBody "So sorry this is late but let's face it there shouldn't be any mystery behind the Step Up genre. Over the last six years these dance flicks have continued to pour out into the theaters and with today's modern television have been eaten up by the public. While the dancing has always been entertaining on various levels the producers are still struggling to add diversity and that something new to keep the crowd interested. Unfortunately for the last two installments that new edge is 3D which may have you wondering Is this really needed for a dance movie? Well I'm back from a late showing to give you the scoop on Step Up Revolution and hopefully answer your questions of whether this sequel is worth a watch.As many of you may have noticed the Step Up series started out balanced in story character development and well choreographed dance moves. However like so many modern movies these days the story is usually sacrificed for some other movie magic that usually is overused more than the send text command on a cellular phone. Yet to my surprise this movie managed to keep a slightly better balance than its previous two predecessors that will grab hold of other audience members. Now I'm not saying it's the best but there is some character development and shallow love stories that will make Dirty Dancing fans pine over that classic romanticism. This doesn't mean it's like a dance version of Twilight no instead it's presented more as a Romeo and Juliet theme where the girl and guys families don't see eye to eye. The lovers decided to hide their identities from their respective elders and instead of killing each other with swords use their moves to help express the feelings and fight the bad guys. Despite the nice presentation though the story is predictable as ever and there really is no surprise about what is going to happen to whom. I won't tell you any details but let's face it in a movie like this you can pretty much guess the ending with little effort.Of course if you're like most fans of this movie you care less about the story and character development. Instead the focus might shift to other aspects like dancing music and yes eye candy for both guys and girls. Well this movie is definitely all those characteristics wrapped in a colorful technorap wrapper with lots of flashing lights. Fans of the previous installments will be impressed with the dance numbers this installment has. Most of the dances have one of the stars leading a well choreographed mob in movements that would give a Michael Jackson music video a run for its money. However what impresses me are some of the sick stunts the extras throw out in between that add that extra edge to the performance. While some of these moves are rather silly i.e. a few guys looking like they are going through electroshock therapy there are a few flips that will make you think Hey he's part Jedi. The break dancing is quite good and when intertwined with the various dance styles in this movie one can't help but be impressed with the work and talent of these people. However don't jump the gun and think this movie is just a bunch of flips and protest art rebel gestures no there is some poetic skills involved as well. As the love story develops there are various scenes that show off the more graceful side of dancing i.e. ballerina moves that are elegant and beautiful. Those who like this artistic style will again be impressed with the fluidity of the actresses involved especially Kathryn McCormick who continues to show us she can dance. However what is dance without music and Step Up Revolution once again picks a soundtrack worthy of their moves. I haven't found out if these remixes are original or picked up from another D.J. but regardless they have been selected to help provide not only the beat for the dances but also the emotion. The moment Penelope opens up the trunk and hits play you start to get pulled into the song and feel the emotions of the setting. Although many of the songs have aggression and rage to their tones there are a few that are softer and more trance like. I warn you that if you don't like Techno Rap or a combination of the two you will definitely hate the music. The tracks are uncensored and full of cursing slang and sometimes loud yelling which may distract you from the art of the editing. Finally if you are one who is going for staring at beautiful women or handsome men well again you've picked the right movie. Unlike some other recent movies Step Up Revolution does a nice job showing off the bodies of the stars and helps get people howling without stepping over the line. Most of these people can dance and are okay actors but they were also chosen to rope in a wider array of audience members. For me I cannot lie that McCormick is very cute did a decent acting job and impressed me with her moves. Even Ryan Guzman and Misha Gabriel Hamilton did a nice job with their roles and didn't just flex their muscles and look sad for the women as many modern guy stars tend to do. Girls don't worry though as there are plenty of shirt off moments to make you happy and guys well there are plenty of bikini clad women to make you drool.Overall Step Up Revolution may be one of the better movies of this series. With awesome moves fitting soundtrack and decent acting it's definitely refreshing for the audience. However it is still a dance movie with a lot of skewing towards dancing and less to story so don't expect masterpiece. Here are the scores DramaMusicRomance 7.58.0 Movie Overall 6.5".

There was a perfect blend of dance and acting. It had a great plot and I would definitely recommend it. Seeing past and current dancers from So You Think You Can Dance was an added bonus. I especially enjoyed Twitch Brandon and Tony Bellissimo you were in it to little 3 Kathryn McCormick proved to be a good actor and an even better dancing which I had expected due to her experiences and performances on SYTYCD. Ryan Guzman was also good seen shirtless through most of the movie added some extra but his acting was good as always and he proved that he could dance. Learning how in only 3 months. Which is impressive considering his fellow dancers. Seen it once.. definitely not enough. Will be going back to theatres and buying it!".

	schema:reviewBody "I gave this movie 4 out of 10 stars. I gave it this number because 4 is the number of years of material with which I can make fun of this movie. In all honesty the dancing was fun and really good but that is where the magic ended. Apparently the screenwriter if she even deserves that title thought that TWO SEPARATE CHARACTER PLOT LINES were in need of the phrase you and me against the world. I really am not lying when I say that two different characters who were connected only through the male lead and literally spoke about five words to each other the entire movie used this clich separately in different points in the movie and directed towards different characters. I am baffled as to why this phrase was even used at all because twice is twice too many. I have so much more to say about this film but I am unfortunately limited to 1000 words. This won't work for me because by the time I approach my limit I will have just delved into the underlying meaning of this movie which is vapid nothingness. And to be fair I'm okay with movies that are just for fun but this movie was fun insofar as there was cool dancing in it. The Step Up franchise has really out done itself with this film. Of course by out done itself I mean tried to see how horrible they could make this movie and still get all the funding they need to do the ridiculous 3D effects.I will leave you with one final bit of wisdom about this movie. This wisdom is actually a praise of the movie which is probably rare. The dance instructor. That is all I have to say and those of you who have regrettably seen the film will know about whom I am speaking. She is gold unadulterated comic gold. I don't know if the screenwriter was struck by lightning while writing her character and somehow made something hilarious. Perhaps they just found an actual dance instructor and told her to act like she normally would. In this scenario dance instructors are strange and often speak in terrible metaphors. Or in the most likely scenario the screenwriter was attempting to write a character who was tough but also a little quirky like we all like our artsyfartsy characters to be. Fortunately for the viewer the screenwriter accidentally created a character who is so bizarre that the audience cannot help but laugh at her antics. It's like watching an old 1950s soap commercial it's so bad it's good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay so I get it this is a dance movie. Still in the first 5 minutes I laughed out loud because it was just RIDICULOUS. I found myself asking one question the entire movie If most of these people don't have jobs and the ones who do are waiters... how do they bankroll this whole thing? There is almost too much evidence to validate this question ahem how many low riders were there in that first scene? A new costume for everyone every flash mob? whoa were those hundred dollar bills floating everywhere? I almost feel like its patronizing to bring all of this up. Undoubtedly all viewers found themselves asking the same question don't lie. If you could get past that then there are the massive plot holes for instance why would the mob be so mad when Emily and her idea singlehandedly won the contest? Who the hell cares if Sean neglected to mention her family tree my god do you want the money or not BRO? I wonder about Sean's side kick too why the hell was he a waiter if he was the computerwhiz kid who was so quickly dubbed Hacker? Seriously you're a waiter? How bout that guy who doesn't speak... he has his own glass hauling truck access to heavy machinery and exorbitant amounts of spray paint and can somehow manage to construct ornate MOB signs in what seems like only a few minutes. Preassembly must be a prerequisite if you're going to have that guys job. Damn he's good. I have an issue with their choice of location as well if you were going to have a flash mob in a spot where you know there would be naysayersand you are soooo concerned with getting arrested then why would you choose a skyscraper a place with only one way in and one way out that is likely full of security and other resistance? I couldn't believe that a second flash mob thirsty for benjamins and blood didn't erupt when dollars started flying. Those Miami natives must all be doing okay for themselves if a cloud of bennies wasn't tempting. Lastly I have NO IDEA how the dancers dressed like the police did not know it was beyond illegal to impersonate the police especially at a press conference for a building ceremony. Lucky for them the Miami PD didn't get the memo and were not attending the ceremony that is interesting. Also what kind of guy works his butt off to be a billionaire only to roll over when 100 dancers happen to roll up and make your already approved construction project a little more of a headache. Seriously that is bad for your street cred Mr. Anderson but your hot rebel daughter evens things out a bit. Well played sir. To conclude I have two words for Mr. Anderson Cleveland really? If you can stop yourself from asking a million questions during this movie then you'll notice that the dancing is pretty epic. Good luck BRO.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the trailer depicted a group of Mob dancers go from performance dancing to protest dancing to save their neighborhood from a development tycoon. I really hope that no one goes to see this film for the story because it is so predictable that it is almost nauseating. I can tell you this if it wasn't for the dance sequences in this film this if one that I would have walked out on. There are instances where dancers should dance and actors should act. This is one of those times. The acting in this film is so incredibly bad that it was almost painful to watch. The fact that Director Scott Speer decided to pair up an MMA fighter with a So You Think You Can Dance alum is beyond me. I do have to say that the dancing parts did get increasingly better as the film went on but that's about it. The relationship that develops between Sean Ryan Guzman and Emily Kathryn McCormick is so bland and boring to watch and they never really seemed to make a connection. I just kept thinking to myself get on with the dancing already. The only dancer that I really recognized was Jason Stephen tWitch Boss. I had seen him act in a few other projects and I can say without a hiccup that he should also stick to dancing. I was not surprised to see other dancers that had also been on So You Think You Can Dance since one of the producers is Adam Shankman who is a staple choreographer and judge on the show. He has been involved with the Step It Up franchise from the beginning but now I think it's time to hang up the dancing shoes on this one. To put it in simple terms I don't go to see films like Transformer or Prometheus for the storyline I go to see them for the special effects. I would put this film in the same category. If you really just like watching a bunch of very well choreographed kids and want to brush up on the latest dances then this film if for you. If not don't waste your time with this one. Wait until it comes to television. I wouldn't even take the time to get it out of Redbox. With all that being said this film did not have all the right moves for me. I give this one a red light.".

It's more of the same but probably even sillier and certainly a step down from the Step Up 3. That predecessor at least included two likable leads and one outstanding set piece shot in one take. This installment really is nothing more than an excuse to show some incredible dance moves being nearly destroyed by MTVstyle editing which makes you feel that although the dancing is probably quite good the editor felt he had to cover this up by what he or she thought was 'clever editing'. Great dancing doesn't need any editing as far as I'm concerned. A weak socalled plot a silly screenplay mediocre performances... there's very little to recommend this. Perhaps you'll enjoy the soundtrack. I sure as hell didn't but there's no accounting for taste is there?".

The movie also pays incredible attention to detail and is not afraid of a little dirt one small thing that stood out to me is when they're eating dinner at the uncle's house and it's kind of dark in there. Movies are always trying to convince us that a few candles light a house just as well as modern electric lights but this one reminds us that no they're candles. It's little things like that I found compelling the characters acquire dirt and grime as they travel the costumes and buildings are quite detailed the Britons up in the north speak Gaelic and nothing but Gaelic. Often in movies with foreign languages the characters will speak that foreign language for a few lines then switch into English. But the Britons keep up their Gaelic and they speak it smoothly and fluently too.I really liked Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell too. Tatum seems to be trying to speak very properly and it's rather odd but he's good as a stoic young man who wants to be honorable and is tired of spending his entire life being chastised for a mistake that he did not make. Jamie Bell is rather fantastic as the slave who has every reason to hate Rome except for his growing respect for his Roman master he's unpredictable and tortured and terribly interesting to watch.It's not a perfect moviesometimes I wasn't sure that it knew what message it was trying to conveybut generally I liked it.

	schema:reviewBody "The Eagle is directed by Kevin Macdonald and adapted to screenplay by Jeremy Brock from the book The Eagle of the Ninth written by Rosemary Sutcliff. It stars Channing Tatum Jamie Bell Donald Sutherland Tahar Rahim and Mark Strong. Music is scored by Atli rvarsson and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle.In 120 AD The Roman Ninth Legion marched into Caledonia they along with their precious Golden Eagle standard were never seen again. 20 years later and Marcus Flavius Aquila Tatum arrives in Britain to serve as a garrison commander. He carries a burden though for the Ninth Legion was led by his father. It is perhaps his destiny that he go forth into Caledonia to maybe solve the mystery and restore honour to the family name?Better angry than dead.A film of two different but equally enjoyable halves The Eagle is a delightful throw back to the swords and shields movies of old. All things are in place for a rollicking tale of courage friendship and honour and the film mostly delivers on its premise. First half is all about character introduction and motives required for plotting. We get some clanking sword play and splendid synchronised army manoeuvres as a garrison defence unfolds. Great to report that CGI and digital blood are not dominating proceedings this is very human even if the editing is of the whippy kind. A turn of events then sees Marcus come by way of Bell's slave incidents are defined and we then move into the second half of the picture.Life life LIFE!Here is where the film becomes a character piece as two men from different walks of life enemies with anger and determination gnawing away at their souls traverse the magnificent Scottish Highlands Dod Mantle's photography is breath taking at times to solve the mystery of The Ninth. What follows is an invigorating olde world adventure where mistrust redemption and unknown tribes reside. Dialogue stays sharp and Macdonald never lest the pace sag. There's a pleasant adherence to period flavourings with the Romans and their foes given an intelligent make over by the writer while it's really refreshing to find there isn't a token female love interest jimmied into the story.Film perhaps inevitably given the modest budget and expectations afforded it is far from flawless but it's becoming increasingly difficult to understand just what the modern audience or indeed old classics movie fans expect of a genre film such as this? The churlish decry the casting of American Tatum in the lead but what he lacks in actual depth of talent is more than compensated for by him knowing how to make the role of Marcus work. With impressive physicality and square jawed machismo he cuts a splendid rugged figure he also knows how to brood essential for any stoic hero stung by a slur on his family name. Bell slots in nicely as the weak of body but strong of mind slave Esca the unrecognisable Rahim scores very well as a warrior tribesman while the technical touches within the picture including rvarsson's score are genre compliant.Sutherland's casting is odd and Mark Strong is badly wasted and the ending whilst satisfactory is not as grandiose as it should be. The latter more galling given the one they rejected that's available in the extras on the DVD would have closed the film down far better. Yet this is a far better film than its box office take and internet ratings suggests it is. The days of magnificent historical epics and eye dazzling choreographed sword fights sadly look a long way off now. That doesn't mean that fans of such films have to accept any genre offering that comes their way for example such as Neil Marshall's very uneven Centurion but something like the smaller scale treats of The Eagle deserve our support. 7.510".

Bell slots in nicely as the weak of body but strong of mind slave Esca the unrecognisable Rahim scores very well as a warrior tribesman while the technical touches within the picture including rvarsson's score are genre compliant.Sutherland's casting is odd and Mark Strong is badly wasted and the ending whilst satisfactory is not as grandiose as it should be. The latter more galling given the one they rejected that's available in the extras on the DVD would have closed the film down far better. Yet this is a far better film than its box office take and internet ratings suggests it is. The days of magnificent historical epics and eye dazzling choreographed sword fights sadly look a long way off now. That doesn't mean that fans of such films have to accept any genre offering that comes their way for example such as Neil Marshall's very uneven Centurion but something like the smaller scale treats of The Eagle deserve our support. 7.510";

It gives a vivid illustration of why Hadrian's wall was built. But I am not totally sure the Roman Senate had a branch in Britain.The two leads Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell were perfectly suited to their roles kind of like Hercules and his sidekick from 60s historical adventure films. But minus the corny jokes. There were no banquets with production numbers. And there was no love interest written in. And no magical effects or mythical creatures. And it was very easy to follow. And hugely entertaining.It's not art but it's rather good regardless.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly Awesome!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Eagle wasn't desperate or overly ambitious it was exactly what you'd want from a tale of friendship and adventure! I'd been prepared for a ten minute opening montage educating us on the sociopolitical climate of Romanoccupied Britain but I was pleasantly surprised with the character focused introduction. I know it's a little unaware but I didn't go see this movie for historical accuracy or to be being preached to about the triumphs of the human spirit. It's a very simple story but epic in its presentation. You get swept into their journey to find the lost Eagle and restore honor to Marcus's family. There are several graphic but never gory battles and a memorable relationship evolving through the movie. The casting was on the money it was a treat to see O'Hare Russell Edgington from True Blood and Sutherland as Marcus's caring uncle. This is undoubtedly Channing's best work he is completely believable as a leader but not infallible as we find out early in the movie when he is injured. Jamie Bell was brilliant as Esca he has a lovely tortured look about him with just a hint of unpredictability that makes him seem dangerous. I won't give it away but he has multiple reasons to want Marcus dead which makes their friendship so compelling. As for the apparently huge Bromance issue it's made even more obvious by the absence of a female lead which I'm fine with. If there isn't a well developed female character then I'm grateful we were spared the token hotgirl who contributes absolutely nothing to the plot other than to offset any male bonding that goes down later in the movie. The Eagle didn't need that sexuality was never a character driving theme. There's definitely love and respect between Marcus and Esca but don't expect them to have any chick flick moments. I only say this because some of the more clumsy interviewers have been harping on it and it's tacky. Obviously if Channing and Bell ever did do a gay themed movie I'd be thrilledelatedfirst in line but I'm not calling gay every time I see two guys next to each other having emotions. I guess people are going to see what they want to see they're both really good looking guys risking their lives for each other I get it. At the end of the day the only thing I found lacking were parts of the dialogue especially in the beginning. That's just nitpicking though. The Eagle was leagues above movies like Troy and Alexander in terms of heart however don't go in expecting Gladiatoresque material. It may as well have been a classic sports flick and the Eagle their Superbowl trophy there's something distinctly American about it. You will however end up caring about the characters which to me makes a movie worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the surface the story is a classic quest tale for the lost Eagle Standard of the lost Legion IX. The real story however  and Marcus' character arch  is Aquila's search to discover his father's fate and atonement with the memory of his father.Kevin MacDonald has made a very clever film that incorporates little known details about the Roman period  enslavement of Romans after the Battle of Teutoburg Forest for one. The cinematography is stunning. To me it is the film that Jim Henson never got to make  not surprising as Duncan Kenworthy was trained how to make a film on The Dark Crystal.  A potential cult classic in my view.All the actors were fantastic. This is not the Channing Tatum of StepUp or She's the Man but of A Guide to Recognising Your Saints and StopLoss. Jamie Bell does a brilliant cruel turn as Esca and had me convinced he had betrayed Marcus. Of course Donald Sutherland and Mark Strong can never do no wrong.As a Classist I adore that MacDonald has bothered to get Roman relationships correct. The film understands the sensibilities of Virtus and Paterfamilias which were sadly lacking in the TV series Rome. There is never a question with who holds the authority between Marcus and his Uncle and when Marcus does overstep his position he is quickly put back in his place. None of this children answering back to their parents which would have certainly resulted in a whipping.People will criticise the film for changing the plot of the book. Cottia is there in Games scene but I suspect that a relationship between a 26 year old Marcus and a 12 year old girl would cause an uproar amongst modern audiences no matter how historically accurate. As for Cub's absence it would have been far too Disney  but if you reread the book you will realise that Esca takes on the role of choosing to return to Marcus instead of returning to the wild. I was pleased that they changed the chase scene as the book ends with Marcus and Esca fleeing back to Hardian's Wall with only the slightest scuffle. It was as though Sutcliff was afraid to put Marcus into a situation of danger and conflict where MacDonald has Marcus looking failure direct in the face.".

There was violence owing to the times but not graphic like most movies these days. In fact people were killed or executed with most of the gory parts off screen or to the side so you didn't see the actual act. There was no sex or nudity which for me is a nice change when I want to see a feature film for the story and not have these scenes thrown in for that type of audience.The story is an intelligent historical adventure bringing the viewer into an unknown world in Northern Scotland. It depicts accurately the relation between the conquering Romans and their subjugated Brittons and Celts. We see Roman period soldiers accurately represented and native Picts as they may have been without many historical records to verify their way of life.The movie is also about a friendship that builds between two men from opposite sides of the conflict and the bonds that build despite their differences in culture. There are lots of battles beautiful scenery and excitement.The movie follows Sutcliff's hunt for the 9th Legion Eagle lost beyond Hadrian's Wall in the the mysterious land of the Picts ruthless tribes of barbarians in present day Scotland. Despite some recent evidence that the 9th Legion was never destroyed in Scotland the story is captivating and despite being fiction has a real authentic feel.I loved this movie and hope for more like it. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Now I'm not great at working out whether this was historically accurate or not so that's not going to be affect the way I rate this movie. I'm just going to assume that all was well unless someone cares to correct me in my ignorance? Except for the fact that thumbs up in a gladiatorial ring means kill simulates thrusting the sword up into the body and thumbs down means live... can't let that one slide ever! As for whether this was based on a true story or not I will leave that to the real journalists.The Eagle is set in Roman occupied Britain in 140AD 20 years after the mysterious disappearance of the whole Ninth Legion in the glens and mountains of Scotland. It follows a Roman centurion Marcus Aquila Channing Tatum and early on we are introduced to the fact that Marucs's father was standard bearer of the eagle for the Ninth Legion and that when they along with the eagle disappeared in the Scottish highlands disrepute was brought to the family of Aquila. Longing to be close to where his father disappeared and to restore his family honour Marcus hot off the training camp for Roman centurions has requested that his first post be at the edge of the known world near Hadrian's wall far from the choice any sane man would pick.Eventually we are introduced to Esca Jamie Bell who is indebted to Marcus after having had his life saved by him and becomes his slave as penance. Together they set off to try and recover the lost eagle which forms an intriguing relationship development between the two characters as Esca is forced to obey his Roman master despite his hatred for who he is and what he stands for. This pairing results in an unpredictable plot with Esca's true intentions well hidden throughout.The main crux of the story seems to be twofold with the development of this relationship between the two men and the desire shown by Marcus to restore the honour of his father and seek closure through the recovery of the eagle. Tatum shines in his part and you can sense the driving passion he has for his cause whilst Bell conveys his internal struggle over his split loyalties well. Other notable acting merit goes to Donald Sutherland for his bit part as the uncle of Marcus.As a whole the battles portrayed are well choreographed and the cameras thrust you up close and personal with the warriors whilst they fight. In what seems to be a developing trend the cameras are shaky and unsteady giving that sense you are actually there. The director Macdonald intentionally kept CGI to a minimum and it has paid off with the movie seemingly more realistic for it. The gore is not excessive and allows for the actual fighting to take centre stage rather than how red they can turn the battlefield which I liked.The Scottish tribes play their part as a conceivable enemy during the film and speak in the native Gaelic tongue which is a nice touch that is less seen now as directors tend to swap to English after a brief dialogue to make it easier on the audience. It was also nice to see that the tribes that crossed paths with our main protagonists each had a different personality and feel about them rather than all being clumped together as Celts and getting portrayed as one generic group.This movie although set in Roman times is less about the history and bureaucracy of Rome and more about the journey that two men take. It's a solid movie with good acting and fighting scenes but it starts to lag slightly in the middle. I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it if there were other choices available but you could do a lot worse.For further reviews feel free to check out httpwww.ireviewfilms.com".

	schema:headline " A gritty solid terrificly entertaining film made by a director who knows what he is doing";
	schema:reviewBody "The Eagle is another fine film in the swordandsandal genre. It has great action sequences some fine heroic traits like bravery and courage and great performances by Channing Tatum surprisingly Jamie Bell Donald Sutherland and other good supporting players. It is history and fiction yet it is rousing in every sense.No it is not as excellent and violentbloody as Gladiator. Everyone is quick to make comparisons. But it is still very good and for a PG13 movie it has quite some bloody scenes as a very stark and bleak atmosphere throughout with a strong sense of unpredictability running throughout the film thanks to very talented director Kevin Macdonald. This is one of the movie's strongest points proving that simplicity is the key to making some great moments in the film. It brings you into the movie taking you on a ride through 140 A.D. Scotland as it really should be.My only gripe is that some of the action sequences have shakycamera to it making a few of the action sequences unfocused but I think this time that shaky camera makes sense because it adds to the chaotic sense during that period where no one is really sure how to battle in that situation adding to the unpredictability. The pace is moderate taking the time to develop Tatum and Bell's characters and the editing is fluid nicely putting the scenes together. Atli Ovarsson too knows when and where to put his music through allowing the film's more effective moments to shine through with or without the music.The script is not exactly new but there are some nice twists given to it. The bonding between the Roman and his Briton slave never really goes beyond that to buddycomedy mode but there are scenes of mutual respect shown towards each other in a very realistic fashion. Both Tatum and Bell showing subtle but good chemistry are great in their roles I'm especially surprised at Tatum's good performance as he has proved that he has the acting chops to go along with his good looks. He isn't playing the fool.Macdonald skillfully directs the film using the traits above and more with focus and attention using real stuntmenextras and real locations without a hint of CGI involved adding even more points to the raw realism of the film. Of course seeing Macdonald's documentary background it comes to no surprise that the film has a very realistic feel to it. The bleak atmosphere gritty but fantastic production and costume design beautiful cinematography by Slumdog Millionaire's Anthony Dod Mantle no doubt and amazing music by Ovarsson this is his first score which I actually liked all combine together with Macdonald and cast and crew to deliver a solid somewhat spectacular action adventure that is old fashioned and devoid of the usual clichs there's no generic romantic subplot thank God! that seem to plague this film genre lately.Made in the hands of another lesser director this film will probably end up looking like The Last Legion or Centurion probably overblown and overstylized. Not here. Kevin Macdonald knows when to put in the bloody scenes when to put in the music and that simplicity is best when it comes to everything. This is terrific entertainment made even better by a director who knows what he is doing and another fine addition to the swordandsandal genre.They don't make them like they use to anymore.Overall rating 74100".

	onyx:emotionText "The Eagle is another fine film in the swordandsandal genre. It has great action sequences some fine heroic traits like bravery and courage and great performances by Channing Tatum surprisingly Jamie Bell Donald Sutherland and other good supporting players. It is history and fiction yet it is rousing in every sense.No it is not as excellent and violentbloody as Gladiator. Everyone is quick to make comparisons. But it is still very good and for a PG13 movie it has quite some bloody scenes as a very stark and bleak atmosphere throughout with a strong sense of unpredictability running throughout the film thanks to very talented director Kevin Macdonald. This is one of the movie's strongest points proving that simplicity is the key to making some great moments in the film. It brings you into the movie taking you on a ride through 140 A.D. Scotland as it really should be.My only gripe is that some of the action sequences have shakycamera to it making a few of the action sequences unfocused but I think this time that shaky camera makes sense because it adds to the chaotic sense during that period where no one is really sure how to battle in that situation adding to the unpredictability. The pace is moderate taking the time to develop Tatum and Bell's characters and the editing is fluid nicely putting the scenes together. Atli Ovarsson too knows when and where to put his music through allowing the film's more effective moments to shine through with or without the music.The script is not exactly new but there are some nice twists given to it. The bonding between the Roman and his Briton slave never really goes beyond that to buddycomedy mode but there are scenes of mutual respect shown towards each other in a very realistic fashion.

	schema:headline " Much less rousing and dramatic than a Gladiator but a solid action epic";
	schema:reviewBody "The latest modern film to play swordsandsandals dressup is The Eagle starring Channing Pretty Boy Tatum a name I bestowed upon him having played Pretty Boy Floyd in Michael Mann's Public Enemies back in 2008 albeit a part of no significance. I suppose when they coined the term hunk no one expected it to apply so literally to the thick and broadshouldered 30yearold.Tatum plays Marcus FlaviusFlave Aquila okay just Flavius Roman centurion and son of a disgraced commander who disappeared along with the entire Ninth Legion and Rome's beloved eagle standard in the north of Britain in 120 AD. Fast forward 20 years and son has chosen to be posted in Britain in hopes of gaining back his his father and Rome's honor by discovering the fate of the legion and recovering the eagle. For Tatum this trip into dangerous territory beyond Hadrian's Wall as it turns out is also a test of leading man meddle.Heading up the real American heroes of G.I. Joe doesn't exactly count for star capability and while The Eagle barely holds a candle to the Roman epic of all Roman epics that is Gladiator it certainly can be seen as a more serious step and one in which the target audience has no interest in ogling him  just watching him kill rebellious Seal Men precursors to Scots.Tatum's grades are definitely passing but he earns more sympathy than attention. He's not quite a commanding presence but Jeremy Brock's script doesn't exactly show us anything about him other than he feels disgraced and he's a good soldier. Flashbacks and dreams about his father riding off never to be seen again are hardly adequate ways to build a hero who can rally our spirits. He can throw down with the best of them but he's better stoic.For the most part The Eagle follows suit. Kevin Macdonald a versatile and underrated director who has an Academy Award for Best Documentary and also directed Forest Whitaker to his Last King of Scotland Oscar keeps the action moving and more old school  old school being the days before CGI. The fight in the beginning all the way to the journey beyond the wall and the perils he faces excite and hold attention. For an epic film that places honor and friendship at the center the stakes just never feel high enough. You'll make an investment in hoping for a peaceful ending but nothing stirs beyond that.The film tries to create several dynamics such as Marcus' daddy issues and the relationship between Marcus and Esca Jamie Bell his servant whose life he saved who over the wall could betray him at any moment but little doubt seeps in. After all while Esca's a tough and resilient guy he was once Billy Elliot  he's probably not screwing anyone over. Actually Bell's performance hurts Tatum's when all is said and done he's much more unpredictable.Roman history nuts will find little to enjoy from that perspective with The Eagle as political undertones are practically nonexistent and you have Americans playing Romans and Brits playing savage Brits. Brock's script sticks to the action and compelling events using a historical period to create a tone much in the way 300 did. Appropriately adjusting expectations for The Eagle to this level will help it retain the honor it deserves for capturing 120 minutes worth of interest with eventful action sequences.Steven CVisit my site httpmoviemusereviews.com".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Eagle";
	schema:reviewBody "I guess stories about Centurions and Legionaries never go out of fashion along with its themes of valour honour camaraderie and the likes and The Eagle adapts from the book The Eagle of the Ninth written by Rosemary Sutcliff published about a half century ago set in the 2nd Century just after Hadrian's Wall went up in Britain. I suppose given director's Kevin Macdonald's success with yet another historically based drama The Last King of Scotland that he decides to take another crack at it albeit this time with a little bit more swords and sandals violence.In recent years we've already seen a number of such films with the likes of Neil Marshall's Centurion and The Last Legion starring Colin Firth and Aishwarya Rai but this one had a little narrative boost with its historical reference involving the mysterious disappearance of the Ninth Legion weaved into the narrative and forming the back story of its protagonist Marcus Flavius Aquila Channing Tatum who had asked for the Britain post in order to seek the lost honour of his father leader of the Ninth who had reputedly surrendered cowardly to the enemy.For starters Channing Tatum isn't really your character actor but looked totally in place with brawn over brains leading his men into battle and convincing peers that his family name isn't as tainted as it should be. But for a moment of bravado he gets himself injured and discharged honourably living at his uncle's place until word came that the eagle standard of the 9th Legion had been found to be in the hands of some indigenous tribe outside of their safe haven. To lead a team into hostile territory will be suicide but Marcus seeks out that sole opportunity to reclaim his father's name and coming in tow is the slave Esca Jamie Bell with whom he forms a lovehate relationship.It's a standard action adventure where you put together two misfits who are as serious as can be in seeking out the objective of their quest containing all the usual formation of a strong friendship clich made more difficult when the masterslave role got reversed when they're held captive. And you also can't put aside some of the homoerotic undertones between the two men in Batman and Robin fashion with constant longing gazes at times reflective of threats to get back at each other given the flipflopping masterslave roles they have to play. The screenplay by Jeremy Brock chooses to focus primarily on the friendship of the men putting aside the politics of the occasion other than to paint the politicians and bureaucrats as fat cats who talk a lot and sit on their bums.The battle sequences though were a different cup of tea altogether with Kevin Macdonald opting for very a very visual treatment that didn't flinch from the bloodier and gorier aspects of close combat. Rarely do you see a decapitation happen on screen but The Eagle does just that without cutting away. Sure it's movie magic but the effect is nothing but startling in addition to slit throats and dismembered limbs. If you're craving for standard period action adventure fare then The Eagle will be that film for you this weekend. Look out for that Mark Strong cameo.".

But to me the real treat of this film is not the imagining of Roman Britain but the steadfast attitude and resolve of the hero Marcus played almost effortlessly by Channing Tatum. The trick is to instill in the men in the audience the feeling of being there seeking to restore the family name despite the odds and Channing is quite good at that. You pick it up from him somehow and that's amazing considering how far we are from Roman times. I would quibble about the portrayal of the barbarians but all in all quite an enjoyable film.".

As expected most of the crowd votes thumbs down mostly due to the fact that they were disappointed with the lack of fight and wish to see some violence however Marcus along with his friends start voting thumbs up which causes the rest of the crowd to agree thus saving his life.The slave is then grateful for his life and offers to become Marcus's slave to repay his debt of gratitude and afterwords helps for his operation on his leg.The next part is very short to explain and is the part I felt was missing.Afterwards Marcus and his slave Esca embark on a journey to find the mighty golden eagle which represents Rome and her glory and find out what happened to his father  according to movie in the land past the wall of North Rome which is a desolate area for RomansUpon arrival to the major Celtic village they have a small argument regarding Esca's Celtic heritage while one of the Celts was watching in confusion. Esca speaking in his native tongue explains that this is simply his slave and that they were arguing.Esca fits in extremely well with the community and people start to like him. Afterwards Esca tells Marcus that he is still with him and still here to help and with his help they get the golden eagle and escape with a search and destroy party of Celts following them.After all the fighting and running they finally arrive at Rome and present it among the senators and Marcus along with Esca is awarded heavily with gratitude.In conclusion this movie had a good plot story and cool fight scenes and I thought that in a way this movie was very similar to The Gladiator  not because it's set in and around Rome but it was missing a huge part which made the ending a slight disappointment.".

Esca speaking in his native tongue explains that this is simply his slave and that they were arguing.Esca fits in extremely well with the community and people start to like him. Afterwards Esca tells Marcus that he is still with him and still here to help and with his help they get the golden eagle and escape with a search and destroy party of Celts following them.After all the fighting and running they finally arrive at Rome and present it among the senators and Marcus along with Esca is awarded heavily with gratitude.In conclusion this movie had a good plot story and cool fight scenes and I thought that in a way this movie was very similar to The Gladiator  not because it's set in and around Rome but it was missing a huge part which made the ending a slight disappointment.";

Let alone fantasize whole new sequences into the film!Want examples?The friendship and mutual respect between Marcus and Esca were replaced by a cheesy subplot of wouldbe danger of betrayal not enough suspense for you Mr Brock eh? and a theme of Escas desire for freedom. Touching as that may be  nothing like that is in the book where Marcus sets his slave free at the very beginning of their journey...In the book the whole search is a stealthy covert operation. Not here  not heroic enough I suppose. So instead of acting as traveling healers they just stop any passerby to directly ask sometimes at swordpoint... for directions to the lost eagle. How very subtle...Guern has become at home north of the wall and has a family. Chapters like these made the book a frequently chosen reading in schools in Europe. Why not show them? Not actionpacked enough?In the book they are both guests of the tribe. Too undramatic for Hollywood. So in a pathetically failing attempt to add some suspense they added some noyouaremyslavetwist not only mangling the atmosphere of the original but also needlessly tearing up plotholes everywhere.So instead of being invited to the rite Marcus Remember  the slave mistrusted by everyone? just sneaks to the holy ground abandons cover as soon as he catches a glimpse of the Eagle and runs towards it screaming. Not to be killed no! Just to be knocked out and left there sleeping amongst the tribesmen  none of whom as much as stirs while Esca wakes up Marcus deals out swords and then hurries along to the holy cave just some steps away.The retrieval of the Eagle  no stealth operation sufficed! A battle had to take place!Did I mention the Eagle still has it's wings in the movie? The strong image of the wingless Eagle of the book... gone! Did any of the filmmakers bother to read more of the book than the blurb!?Where is the respect the tribe's elder has for the chief of the Romans? Gone! Instead he insults him with his very dying words. How befitting... for an 80sactionmovie villain! But not here! In the book he even sends the ring as a gift and as an appreciative nod to Marcus. Too complicated for the targetaudience? Oh I forgot! They changed Marcus from an honorguest to a slave so they could not keep this subplot either. Pity that...The chase could not end like in the book. Unthinkable! Instead there had to be the obligatory final battle tm including the evenmoreobligatory showdown of the mainhero and the mainvillain tm who beforehand just kills his own son for no other reason than to make it absolutely clear that he is as bad as it gets and the also obligatory returntohonor of the lost soldiers tm. Oh please!Bring back the Eagle silently? Not in Hollywood you don't! Plug it on a pole and stride around showing it off  that's more like it!And then the end! It got me howling and fidgeting literally! In the book the whole point of the search  to reclaim the honor of the 9th  turns out to have been in vain in the end because the senate refuses to reinstate it. But hey that ain't no happy end  and the brainless species known as audience to Hollywoodfilmmakers is deemed too stupid to cope with something as complicated as that please not that the novel is considered a read suitable for 14yearolds.... So here the script comes to the rescue cramming in a triumphant stride tm to the fat senators tm including the mandatory public humiliation of the arrogant upstart tm who readily declare the 9th Legion to be reopened and Marcus appointed their leader. What a hoot! Get the celebratory popcorn flying!Oh come on! This plainly is an insult not only to the book but to me as a viewer too!Why leave out whole passages? Because of timeconstraints? I can accept that. But then don't waste precious minutes to cram in cheesy Hollywoodclichs everywhere!So do us all a favor Next time you don't think a novel would make a good movie as it is... just leave it to another team!Please stop crippling books into runofthemill summeractionflicks!Because the movie in itself is quite wellmade I still give it a 310.Harald DehnerP.S. When I saw there is an alternative ending on the BluRayrelease I thought this would be the rightful one that  so I supposed  got kicked by some gormless studio executive after the ultimate and definitive end of all originality known as test screening.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is atrocious!!! This is two hours of my life that I will never get back. I NEVER review a movie. However this robbed me of good sleep although there were times in the movie that I did start to drift. I want to repay it by giving a review and take back what is rightfully mine no not a damn eagle my sanity. First off the acting is horrible. I understand that this movie is trying to reach a certain demographic but they could have tried a little harder with their casting. Channing Tatum although a hot stud to all the tween girls out there has about as much acting range as a brick. You could have easily casted John Cena The Rock or that blonde haired goober from The Fast and Furious so unimportant I forgot his name and received the same resultsworthlessness. The two reasons I gave this movie a one out of 10 stars is that first and most importantly it wouldn't let me give a zero and second would be Donald Sutherland. However Donald's acting not that great in this movie thus why he hasn't been in anything worth a damn in years is still Donald Sutherland. Second of all is the script in this movie. All I can say is wow! One of my favoritesarcastically lines in the movie is when Sutherland's character is discussing the odor of medicine and compares it to a fart. He actually says fart. So let me get this straight a Roman noblemen says the word fart. I wonder what annuls of history we reviewed to uncover such truth in speaking. I was disappointed at the fact that they did not use a more appropriate dialog in this movie. Hell even the Stars show Spartacus Of Blood and Sand uses a crude form of dialog that would be more related to the time. Then again I expect to much and this supports my claim that Tatum has no range in acting. Hell they didn't even try to throw in an accent. I was left confused for two reasons here because on occasion they did try and use dated terminology when they discussed that Marcus was forced to travel by mule and buggy for 200 leagues to receive medical attention only to be followed by the fart line. The second confusing point would be the fact that they used authentic language from the Britannia's. If they went this far why not be equal on both sides. Oh yeah I forgot the acting range wasn't all there. This brings us to the climatic ending. I believe my climatic ending to this review will be just as relevant maybe even more so. If anything it will be longer. So I sit and watch this move over two hours about this man's idiotic and unbelievable quest for the famed Eagle 20 years lost by now. He surpasses on many occasions a very reasonable death which would have made this move better and shorter. He finally gets said trophy and has to face its evil owners who stole it and now want it back. These men who run fast as horses who also deify death one horse not so lucky are now to face about 15 Roman Legion soldiers who were cowards at first with a ratio that seems about 3 Seal men to 1 Roman. This should be a fair fight especially that the Seal men are stronger than Hourses. So what do we get? The crusty non trained yet somehow quickly assembled geriatric soldiers to battle the numerous youthful gorilla tactical painted seal people of the north. This is the part that really confused me though we have a small child get slain in front of his dad and who gets to fight his assailant in the endnope not his dad. Another odd part is that this highly trained painted seal leader slays about half of the Romans on his own bringing the numbers down dramatically yet he gets choked out in about 30 seconds and thenof the remaining 50 or so seal people none of them zero attack Marcus or his Britannia friend. Oh man the ending should be awesome. They found the Eagle this is gonna rock! Now we are at the conclusion to the movie and my review. They have the stupid bird and we cut back to Rome or some Rome occupied territory where Marcus approaches the Roman Leaders unchallenged or unhindered. And all we get is two minutes. What the hell. He approaches the council and in a rushed dialog the finder of the infamous Roman Eagle gets a simple thank you from Rome. Wow!!! Ridiculous!!! I can hardly wait for the sequel.".

However this robbed me of good sleep although there were times in the movie that I did start to drift. I want to repay it by giving a review and take back what is rightfully mine no not a damn eagle my sanity. First off the acting is horrible. I understand that this movie is trying to reach a certain demographic but they could have tried a little harder with their casting. Channing Tatum although a hot stud to all the tween girls out there has about as much acting range as a brick. You could have easily casted John Cena The Rock or that blonde haired goober from The Fast and Furious so unimportant I forgot his name and received the same resultsworthlessness. The two reasons I gave this movie a one out of 10 stars is that first and most importantly it wouldn't let me give a zero and second would be Donald Sutherland. However Donald's acting not that great in this movie thus why he hasn't been in anything worth a damn in years is still Donald Sutherland. Second of all is the script in this movie.

From that description they looked like the Na'vi from Avatar none of them looked old enough to be warriors but in their adolescence age it was like watching Lord of the Flies. What got more stupid was that the survivors of the ninth legion all now veterans happened to engage combat with the white powder natives it's unbelievable so many veteran romans were killed just by a few adolescent teens with weapons that were no match to theirs. There was one thing they never clarified and that was what the chieftan last said or who he was before the roman killed him. It was never mention again so it leaves a question unanswered. Overall I consider this a B Grade movie so don't expect too much from it although more could of been done. It was a snatch and grab eagle with natives in hot pursuit for them they could of at least made the tribe more warlike.".

	schema:reviewBody "The best thing about this good old fashioned Roman days adventure is the absence of too much CGI and special effects. The fights and battles are exciting without having thousands of soldiers on screen. It's also not too violent so it's suitable for the family.The story is neat and satisfying. Basically Channing Tatum is a Roman officer trying to regain his family's honor by reclaiming an Eagle captured by the Britons. There is no jumping around unnecessarily in time and space and no twisted characters. It's got a good human aspect to the story without being sentimental. The loyalty aspect within the master slave relationship are quite good but not overdone.The acting is adequate. Jamie Bell as shown in Defiance is a good supporting actor to this movie where he plays a Briton slave. He is convincing and impressive even though he is so small sized. Channing Tatum as the Roman officer with an ugly Roman hairstyle to match doesn't show too many different expressions on his face. Donald Sutherland is a bit out of place and the other Romans lack a Roman feel. Nobody tries to fake accents and maybe that's for the best.One strange thing  it show the early Britons with painted faces teeth necklaces and skins for clothing rather like primitive tropical island savages. We all know Britain is a relatively recently civilized nation but would they really look like that in year round freezing Scotland? Maybe they wanted to show a link to the modern day British punk  soccer hooligan.Anyway the movie is better than the box office receipts have shown and the little publicity and marketing it got. It's worth watching and enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Note I stay away from describing the plot in any detail because it would be very hard to do so without spoiling elements of it. Inside Man starts out as a no holds barred high octane actionthriller and by its midpoint fully transforms into a breezy tongueincheek heist movie reminiscent of The Sting. I felt it to be a little overplotted but that comes with the genre  the expected twists and turns are all here thankfully mostly in nonexpected ways. Contrivances abound and we don't really learn the background of the heist ie. how the robbers learned about their target but the story and the overall atmosphere more than make up for this. The meticulously designed plot also compensates for the lack of real 3D characterization  save for Denzel Washington's ambitious policeman hero who at least achieves a level of humanity throughout the story. The character interaction between him and his sidekick Chiwetel Ejiofor of Serenity fame and the frustrated captain played by Willem Defoe is great with some sparkling dialog. Clive Owen is okay most of the time convincing as the criminal mastermind although he spends most of the film wearing a mask. I'd say this film is harmless fun not your usual Spike Lee fare which goes to prove his versatility. There is a hint in the backstory at some heavy issues of the past but it's nothing more than a macguffin that only achieves some slight significance in the resolution of the movie. There is a neat structural trickery in the use of flashforward scenes hinting toward the aftermath of the heist without giving away the real ending. It's used sparingly and cleverly. I can highly recommend this movie it is never boring for a moment what's more I was enjoying it so much that as events were progressing toward the climax I was wishing it would go on. And that's very rare for me in the movies nowadays.".

	schema:headline " With Inside Man Spike Lee has crafted a very original and exciting thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "Spike Lee is one of the most consistent directors out there. Save for some more uneven pictures like She Hate Me and Girl 6 Lee's body of work is just plain impressive. And while Inside Man is not up there with Do The Right Thing Clockers and 25th Hour it is definitely an entertaining and intelligent thriller that does things a little differently than most cookie cutter thrillers you see in theaters nowadays.A bank robbery in New York has gotten out of control and it's up to police detective Keith Frazier Denzel Washington to act as hostage negotiator and get the bank personal and customers out safely before things turn even worse than they already are. This turns out to be a tough case since the leader of the bank robbers Dalton Russell Clive Owen turns out to be a very smart individual who has everything planned to perfection and who throws up surprise after surprise for Frazier and his men. But while the people around Frazier are slowly getting more and more nervous he himself does not lose his mind and begins a high stakes battle of wits with Russell. Things are further complicated however when the mayor of New York introduces a mysterious woman to Frazier. This woman Jodie Foster wants to protect something that is hidden in one of the safety deposit boxes inside the bank and she will stop at nothing to force Frazier to let her inside the bank and make sure nothing happens to the contents.This all sounds like an intriguing premise for a thriller but the movie goes a few steps further than just having an interesting plot. Because while Inside Man does hit all the right notes when it comes to keeping you guessing about what is really going on it is also very successful in mixing the grittier moments with comedy elements. At times Inside Man is very funny but in a way that does not deflate the tension. The dialogue is sharp with the conversations between Frazier and Russell being especially fascinating and both actors are at the top of their game in this new movie. Washington's Frazier is an intense but laconic individual who has a permanent smirk on his face but who reads the bank robbers intentions better than anybody else while Owen is charismatic and fascinating as the mastermind behind the bank robbery. I was a little disappointed however with Jodie Foster's role. While her part is potentially fascinating she does not really get the chance to do anything with it other than look cool and act tough. Yes we all know that she is very good at that but with a bit more background story and a bit more screen time her part could have been even more interesting.With Inside Man Lee showcases an interesting way of directing thrillers. He ignores the usual build up that you see in thrillers which consists of an introduction a chronological development of the main intrigue followed by a final act in which everything is wrapped up neatly even flashing forward several times thus revealing some important developments before they have happened and this only serves to make Inside Man a movie that is more than your regular suspense movie. I enjoyed this original approach very much even though he does take quite a long time to wrap things up at the end.".

Clive Owen is terrific as the mastermind. He and the plot keeps you guessing. And while there are plenty of clues they are so well incorporated that very few viewers will see how this one comes together in the end.One major quibble Jodie Foster's character is more archetype than person so it's to her credit that she pulls it off as well as it does. However don't let that deter you from enjoying one of the best movies of the year. I'm glad to see Spike Lee tackle another genre film.

	onyx:emotionText "A pleasure from start to finish. An older Denzel Washington has begun to emerge and his performance here suggests he has many good years left. Clive Owen is terrific as the mastermind. He and the plot keeps you guessing. And while there are plenty of clues they are so well incorporated that very few viewers will see how this one comes together in the end.One major quibble Jodie Foster's character is more archetype than person so it's to her credit that she pulls it off as well as it does. However don't let that deter you from enjoying one of the best movies of the year. I'm glad to see Spike Lee tackle another genre film. He brings a reinvigorating approach to what in other hands would be a tiresome rehash. That liveliness seems to have worked on him too  this is his best film in several years.";

My only problem was that after the bank robbery was over the film continued for another half hour and it started to drag a bit. The dialogue in the movie is very cool. There's some humorous and some awesome lines that come out of the character's mouths.The acting is very good. Denzel Washington is good as always as Det. Keith Frazier.

At one point a Sikh has his turban taken away and complains at ends how Sikhs are not Arabs and he's tired of getting harassed all the time.Anyway the cast is great  Denzel Washington Clive Owen Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer are all topdrawer actors. Willem Dafoe has a smaller part that doesn't use all of his talents unfortunately. The clever twist the plot adds is that the bank robbers dress everybody up in the same masks and jump suits that they themselves are wearing. So if the police raid the bank they'll have a difficult time figuring who the bad guys are. This isn't a spoiler  it's in the trailers. Clive Owen and the robbers are clearly up to something that becomes apparent during the course of the film. They are particularly interested in the safety deposit box of the bank CEO played by Christopher Plummer. Jodie Foster is brought in by him to protect his interests. Her existence is amusing in that it reveals a bit about what Spike Lee thinks the corridors of white power are like. Here's a hint Spike rich white folks don't swear at each other quite as much as you make them do and in particular the word used by the Mayor to describe Jodie Foster's character is way beyond the pale. A real woman with as much influence as her character had would retaliate massively after being so described. But Spike Lee has never quite managed to capture any female character correctly dating all the way back to Nola Darling. I digress. The good parts of the film involve the interactions between Washington and Owen. Also the many small manonthestreet conversations are great. This aspect of observing street life has always been one of Lee's strongest points.It was interesting watching a Spike Lee caper film. I kinda like the idea. It's better than the formulaic caper films that are the rage and features some of Lee's trademark shots like when he puts an actor on a dolly to create nonwalking walking movement. I recommend the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This review is full of SPOILERS and is meant for those who've seen this film. 1. Major plot flaw. The police would have identified the painters almost immediately and this is hidden from the audience by the way in which the interrogation scenes are handled. The criminals' strategy for escape was to blend in with the other hostages and be unidentifiable. The video surveillance cameras were disabled only 2 minutes before the painters entered. By checking the videos the police would see what customers had entered the bank before then and could rule them out as painters. The police could also ruleout all employees not only because employees would be on tape but even if not the employees would know who of their number was in the bank at the time they were seized. This means that the painters could only be customers and could only be among those customers who walked in during the two minutes between disabling the cameras and the entry of the painters. Look at the number of customers already in the bank before the cameras went out  a lot. Not many came in during those 2 minutes even if some left during those 2 minutes. At most let's say that 12 people came in during those 2 minutes including the painters. Then get physical descriptions of the painters' height weight sex etc. from all the hostages. Compare those with the physical details of the 12 people. Of the 12 people how many match each description? If one the police have spotted a painter already. If 2 or 3 or 4 the police have a very small number of people to investigate further to expose which of that small group is a painter. Moreover every customer has to have a reason for being there either to deal with an existing account or open a new one. But a person opening a new account would go to an employee to start the process. So the painters each had to have already established an individual account with that bank. When did those 12 people open their accounts? The police would look at the time each of the 12 first opened an account. More recent accounts opened at about the same date would indicate who the painters might be. Now why were each of the 12 at that downtown branch at that time as opposed to a different branch or a different time? It must be either they work nearby or live nearby or are running an errand where the route includes that branch. What friend or relative saw them in person before they left to go to the branch? How did they get to the branch  walking or subway or taxi? How were they planning to get to their next destination? Where did they plan to go after their errand at the branch was finished? Who was expecting to see them at that place? Did anyone who was expecting to see them later that day wonder what had happened to them or call the police to ask whether they were among the hostages? Recently opened accounts near the date of other accounts by people who neither live nor work near that branch or have a plausible errand who can't tell a plausible tale of how they got there or where they planned to go next or who was expecting them these are the prime suspects for painters. The police very swiftly will have a very good idea who the painters are. Investigate them in detail and they are exposed then pressure them to reveal the identities of the other criminals. This is what real police would do but the movie by showing the police pursuing a different useless approach leads the audience to think the painter masquerade would work. This movie operates on the old principle the criminal plot looks brilliant because the police are made to act like idiots yet look intelligent. 2. Major moral blindness. 50 innocent citizens are terrorized held hostage assaulted battered for a day a very significant crime and yet at the end we are told that because nothing was stolen from the bank the government and the police are just going to drop the whole affair. But what the criminals did to those people was a far more serious crime than any theft of bank property would have been. This movie passesoff that crime as if it were nothing nothing at all. The terrorized hostages are pushed off the stage like so many plastic dolls who've served their role in the filmmakers' story. But those characters are human beings. The criminals supposedly motivated by an idealistic desire to act against a Nazi profiteer commit a horrific moral injustice on innocent people whose rights and dignity they are blind to in the pursuit of their own moral mission. This is a profound moral flaw in this film. The criminals are narcissists so focused on their own desire for justice in their cause that they are blind to the injustice they inflict on others as they pursue their mission. 3. Unbelievable characters. A billionaire bank president anguished over his past exploitation of the Holocaust but who is trying to hide his past by hiring a real estate agent who has a sideline as a highlevel fixer of rich people's problems who is herself disgusted by his proNazi past yet takes his payoff check anyway and whose only attempt to fix the problem is a short and ineffective conversation with the criminal mastermind? A supposedly smart and honorable police hostage negotiator who is also the chief interrogator of the suspects and who takes a diamond payoff from the mastermind with a laugh and who is completely blind to the serious crime of terrorism and hostagetaking of 50 civilians? None of these characters is believable.".

The criminals are narcissists so focused on their own desire for justice in their cause that they are blind to the injustice they inflict on others as they pursue their mission. 3. Unbelievable characters. A billionaire bank president anguished over his past exploitation of the Holocaust but who is trying to hide his past by hiring a real estate agent who has a sideline as a highlevel fixer of rich people's problems who is herself disgusted by his proNazi past yet takes his payoff check anyway and whose only attempt to fix the problem is a short and ineffective conversation with the criminal mastermind? A supposedly smart and honorable police hostage negotiator who is also the chief interrogator of the suspects and who takes a diamond payoff from the mastermind with a laugh and who is completely blind to the serious crime of terrorism and hostagetaking of 50 civilians? None of these characters is believable.";

	schema:headline " By not being a straight genre film it manages to strengthen and weaken itself at the same time";
	schema:reviewBody "An ordinary day in a major bank a man dressed as a painter walks in and points torches at the CCTV cameras. Seconds later more people dressed as painters burst in and announce their intentions to all inside. As the hostages are professionally moved into a group and made to dress in the same suits as the robbers the alarm is raised by a passing cop. For Detective Frazier this is just what he needs to help take his mind off accusations of corruption and girlfriend stress. With a bythebook hostage situation in front of him things look good but internal and external pressures soon convince him that things are not as straightforward as he first thought.With the trailer offering a great Saturday night twisty crime thriller a heavy cast and a strange directorial choice in Lee this was a film I was hoping would be glossy slick silly and fun. However although I enjoyed it for what it was I must confess that the lack of consistent direction and pace made it more difficult to get into than I had hoped. It isn't like this at first with the film jumping right into a very slick taking of the bank and establishing a professional group of thieves to content with. Bringing in Frazier continues this delivery because he has a good swagger to him and it looked like they would pull off this film. You see things like this need pace and energy and direction  like sharks they need to keep moving forward or they die they die by letting the audience question things or move back off the edge of their seat to a vantage point of criticism. With things like Phone Booth we were never allowed to step back and thus it worked however here it tries to do other things to its credit but these produce an irregular pace inconsistent tone and tend to take away from the central gripping action without putting in more than they take out.It still works but it steps away from the robbery too often to touch on other areas. Now these areas could have been a great compliment to the main thread but they don't work as well as they should. The external pressures from Madeline White should have increased the tension in the film but instead they were mostly separate  interesting still but not complimentary. It doesn't help that many of the twists are obvious certainly the reason for the robbery was obvious  even if it is never actually explained or justified that well and when the final one does come it is delivered too slowly and reduces its impact. The film is funny and this works quite nicely without slowing things down. The device of the interviews as jumps forward is interesting but unfortunately it tells the audience too much and spoils some of the later action by making it too predictable. Like I said I still enjoyed it but at times I found myself bothered by the impression that it was a genre movie actively trying not to be a genre movie and only hurting itself in the progress.Visually the film is impressive even if occasionally it felt inappropriate for the material. The movement of the camera the lush shots of New York the chestcam shots and the use of music are all unmistakably Spike Lee and it looks great for it. At times it is a bit obtrusive and almost feels too grand for the material but it is hard to criticise a great director which is what I personally think Lee is for having his own style and feel even if at times he is a fault for reducing the pace and energy of the material. He shows that although his personal films are more interesting he can do a good job as directorforhire as well. The cast are impressive on paper but the delivery means they are not all that good. Foster is a good example she is a solid presence but her material is weak and halfdone and I personally felt she could have been totally removed from the film without any great detriment. Washington is cool in the lead and gives a lively genre performance. The film suggests that he thought he was doing more than just a genre film and there are bits of his character that don't work  his eclectic wardrobe is one but his past and his girlfriend are also threads that don't work that well. Owen is lucky enough to have the best material and despite a soso accent he does convince and drives the film forward. His motivations and background are annoying question marks but this is not his fault  it is the fault of the delivery that let me question things rather than rushing forward at full speed. Ejiofor is good and works well despite having little to work with. Dafoe is a nice addition but I did feel his material could have been done by someone less famous just as well as he did. Plummer starts the film with such an air of a powerful old man with sinister secret that you never doubt for second where the film is taking him  again not all his fault but he is not used at all well.Despite all my misgivings the film did do enough to engage me and entertain me on a Saturday night as I suspect it will many viewers. However in the cold light of day the film does have threads that don't work and problems relating to pacing and inconsistency in tone. Funnily enough it is actually the irregular pace that reveals the problems whereas it is had played itself as a straight genre film then it would have covered these with pace and energy. Worth seeing but by not being a straight genre film it manages to be both stronger and weaker at the same time.".

However last is also misleading because all three were very good movies. Inside Man was directed by Spike Lee. Prior to seeing Inside Man let me give you a list of all the Spike Lee movies I've ever enjoyed watching 1. Malcolm X 2. hmmm... ummmm... nevermind. So I didn't really have that high of expectations. However I have to admit that this movie is extremely well made. It's evident from the beginning of the movie. In the first 5 minutes of the movie the camera shot changes every five seconds. Normally this would just annoy me but the editor managed to do this without wasting a single one of those five second shots and with great accompanying music it was actually one of my favorite opening sequences ever. While the camera work is great throughout what really makes this movie stand out are the great performances by the two leads. Clive Owen is great as a not your everyday bankrobber and Washington is wonderful somehow giving an incredibly fresh performance in spite of the fact that he's playing a cop for what seams like the 11th time in his past 12 films. Its an interesting story with some decent twists and better than average dialouge. This is just a very good movie with something for almost everybody.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a dumb movie. Maybe my judgment wouldn't be so harsh if the film didn't promise so much but I just felt like this movie cheated and played me for a fool at every turn.I didn't have any beef with the acting but I thought the characters were awful. The movie starts off with Clive Owen's character telling us what a criminal mastermind he is and how he planned the perfect bank robbery something he frequently reminds us of later. Oh yeah he also tells us he's in a prison cell although that turns out to be a dumb metaphor. Any idiot knows that the best bank robbery is one where a minimum number of things could potentially go wrong and you're long gone before the police show up. But Clive Owen's scheme requires hanging around the bank for hours  for no reason but to stalk around and look scary as far as I can tell. He also has to control hostages negotiate with cops and most fantastically of all perform a ThisOldHouse job on the bank's stockroom and hide out there for a week I hope he brought enough food and a bucket to pee in and then sneak out again. Yeah that sure sounds like the perfect crime to me Clive! This plan has so many moving parts that the only reason it didn't fall apart was the screenwriter said so.And then there are the many unexplained details Why were the cops so convinced that the crooks had accomplices among the hostages? Who the hell is Jodie Foster's character and why is she so important that she has the mayor at her beck and call and she doesn't have to tell Denzel Washington her agenda because it's above his pay scale? How dumb are these cops that they can't figure out one guy speaking in a foreign language for hours is not the sound of a criminal gang planning a robbery? How did the robbers slip away and why did Clive Owen stick around for a week? How did they find out about the bank chairman's past and the number and contents of his safe deposit box? Why the hell would Clive Owen let in Jodie Foster or the cops? Since when do they make toy AK47s that look real up close? How the hell do you bug a pizza box anyway? How did Clive Owen manage to sneak out of a secure area of the bank during working hours undetected? Did this dispassionate criminal really feel bonded enough to this cop Denzel to slip him a diamond?None of these questions are ever answered. There are films that achieve depth by leaving you to wonder about events that happen offscreen but I never felt that way about Inside Man. It felt like the scenes that explained these things were cut from the movie or these questions never had any answers in the first place and that's weak. Particularly annoying is Jodie Foster's character who won't disclose what she does but never seems to tire of reminding us how important she is. We're just supposed to take her word for it I guess.The only reason I gave this movie two stars is I laughed at Denzel's taxi cab and pina colada gags and at the kid's outrageous video game. Other than that this movie has no redeeming features.".

See the main problem with Inside Man is that the film's turns aren't half as dramatic as the film's makers want you to feel they are. Lee simultaneously draws upon and contrasts the film against old heist classics such as Dog Day Afternoon. As a result we get a film with edges far far more interesting than its basics are. We get the Sikh bank worker who complains about his rights being violated and the young boy with the ultraviolent video game that the character Dalton Clive Owen is shocked by and so on. At least the film's denouement is full of interesting bits that help compensate for the heist portion's ineffectiveness. Nonetheless this is Inside Man confusing uneventful and not half as important as it would like to be.".

	schema:headline " Would have been better if it wasn't so 'clever'...";
	schema:reviewBody "It's all too obvious that Inside Man is meant to be a lot more clever than it actually is director Spike Lee peppers his film with a light sprinkling of comments on race and society but not many of them hold any weight and by the time the film ends it's difficult to work out just what Lee is actually trying to say. Films that try to be intelligent and fail usually receive low ratings from me but this one manages to claw some points back because it is entertaining and the central bank robbery plot line is intricately handled with care and panache. It's a shame that Lee decided to try and make more of this than was necessary. I realise that a great deal of undemanding bank robbery films have already been made but this one could have been one of the best if the director had stuck to the strongpoints. The plot has two sides to it as we follow a bank robbery from inside the bank and out. Dalton is a smart bank robber who figures out a way to both rob a bank and bamboozle the police at the same time. Denzel Washington is the cop on the case while the plot is given a third dimension from a scheming power broker.One of the principle problems with this film is that too much is made of it and the plot sometimes doesn't come together very well as Lee analyses his plot from both a past and present perspective. This means that we have the police interviewing suspects at the same time as the robbery is going on and this usually involves cutting back to the bank and seeing someone doing something memorable before Denzel Washington and his partner try to crack the people they think could be responsible. It gets a bit repetitive too often but there's usually just about enough going on to make the film interesting. The acting is good with the wooden Clive Owen getting a role that suits him as the masked bank robber while the charismatic Denzel Washington provides more interest as the copper. Willem Dafoe doesn't make much of an impression however and Jodie Foster could have been better used. Scenes such as the one that sees a kid talking to Clive Owen about a video game involving some rapper are painful and unnecessary however. The heist plot is well worked out though and seeing the plan come together at the end is the film's biggest highlight. Overall I can't say I didn't enjoy this film as its entertaining and well worked but it's not the great film that the director obviously wanted it to be.".

If Mr Chase is aware that someone out there knows about his terrible past then surely that's even more reason to destroy the evidence? The whole story is so frustratingly vague like reading a book with half the pages missing. Aside from this none of the characters are at all fleshed out and the film totally lacked tension. Which leaves us having to concentrate on the ridiculous plot. Also the end dragged interminably. I've given it 5 because it looked good some of the performances were top notch and it made me laugh a few times.".

We are further informed through flash forwards that all hostages survive the bank robbery. There are two prime issues that no one has addressed for me not even Spike Lee and Mr. Gewirtz his screenwriter. Specifically a Who was the Inside Man? Was it Case the Christopher Plummer character? The rabbi? The employee who lied about his cell phone and was severely beaten? The kid who would not wear his hood? Heck was it the 8yearold with the video game b How did DaltonClive Owens' character select box 392? Did Case hire Dalton? As the sole purpose of the heist was to get the content of that box was it dumb luck or was Dalton clued in? If Case is in the Inside Man why doesn't he get his own incriminating evidence out of the box shouldn't he have burned it a long time ago?.

	schema:reviewBody "I have never seen any of Spike Lee's prior films as their trailers never caught my interest. I have seen and admire Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster's work and have several of their DVDs. I was however entirely disappointed with this movie. If this film is any indication of Spike Lee's ability as a director my advice would be to get a job and stop wasting the time and talent of others. I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators watched the same movie that I'd seen. I can only assume from their sappy lovelorn reviews that their adoration of Spike Lee has blinded them to the banality of this piece of work. I only paid 2.50 in a Second Run theater and still felt I'd wasted my money.The IMDb Trivia page says it all....... Shot in 39 days  How can you expect to shoot a big budget Blockbuster as the media hype promised in such a short time? No wonder there was such a weak performance by all. Ron Howard was first going to direct the film...  He may have done this project some justice given more time to do so of course. Though the writing was atrocious the premise had some merits. OK! maybe not. I'm sorry! This film was so rife with pitiful clich's implausible scenes and lousy characterizations that maybe even he couldn't have made much of it. Hey Ron! Be sure to thank Russell...Good call!  Jodie Foster filmed her part in three weeks.  And it showed! Her portrayal of a Fixer who makes people's problems go away was as unbelievable as the script she was given. Did she even want to be there?Other Peeves  How many bank robbers would bother to come to the door and inform a uniformed police officer that they were inside robbing the bank and he'd better keep away...or else?  When Detective Frazier Denzel Washington comes into the bank to verify there are no corpses yet how many bank robbers without a gun would have led a cop much less let a cop back out to the front door allowing the police officer to walk behind him?  Det. Frazier later claimed to have given the robber every reason to shoot me. Why then in their brief struggle didn't he even try to expose the robber's face? That may have gotten the response he was looking for...a robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification. And why did it take Steve Stevie SteveO the robber's accomplice so long to come and help out?  I understand that these weren't your typical bank robbers. They had a different agenda and didn't want anyone harmed. But the cops had no reason to think that they wouldn't. To them it was a desperate situation. Why then when two of the bad guys stepped outside to pick up the pizzas? were they not taken down. first of all how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield? Is this Spike Lee's version of NY City or SNL's?. Taking them down would have reduced the bad guy's numbers screwed up their plans and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up. If not there at least would be fewer bad guys inside. Give SWAT something to do or send them home! What police department in this country would have allowed Madeline White Jodie Foster to just waltz right into the bank and discuss a matter with the robbers that she would not disclose to them first? She had no authority no governmental credentials and besides this was after all already a hostage situation...add one more? Why wouldn't the Bank CEO Christopher Plummer just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago? Screw sentimentality! The diamonds he could have sold. Who was that schmuck the character not the actor with the Jersey accent that conveniently volunteered and said he knew the recording was 100 Albanian but yet he himself couldn't speak it.....SIR! PUT YOUR HAND DOWN! And his Exwife! What a schlump she was!!! Both were totally unbelievable.  When interrogating suspects why did Det. Frazier continually harass the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist? i.e.  telling the elderly woman she could go and then she couldn't then could then couldn't? Give me a break!  Who after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put on jump suites couldn't deduce their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages?  Near the end of the movie a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room behind which Clive Owens hid out for a week....where did the materials come from? the drywall  studs. It was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer so he could relieve himself. The bank employees hadn't complained about the smell all week long? Hello! After such a debacle since the documents had fallen into the robber's hands what kind of references was Ms. White expecting to get from the bank CEO seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail due to her failure? And last but certainly not least What's with the Electric Glide that Denzel did? HOW STUPID! Was that supposed to indicate his resolve to bring these guys to justice? He looked rather like a man who hopped a ride on a shopping cart while trying to prevent a bowel movement! CheeeeZheeee!!!! Other than the mediocre plot lousy script bad acting and overall pitiful directing......yada yada yada. Hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not!.".

	schema:reviewBody "For most of its length Inside Man looks to be a great crime movie. The movie is efficient and stylish. Even the smallest characters are given real personalities and the movie has a wonderful sense of New York attitude. Denzel gives a thoughtful performance and Plummer is excellent. The script is smart.But then about two thirds of the way through problems with the script begin to show up. The movie begins to seem unfocused and some of it is unconvincing and even tending towards the ludicrous. One begins to realize that Jodie's character serves no use in the story and the story itself wanders off in an odd and unconvincing direction. The final idea behind the story isn't bad so much as the execution there is no proper setup in terms of plot or character. It really feels like the scriptwriter had an idea that he was determined to use even though he couldn't completely get a handle on it.Still it's fun for the most part and even though it loses a lot of momentum at the end it's still reasonably entertaining. And it's certainly worth watching.SPOILER Here's a small but telling example of a script problem. After this big hostage thing and standoff the cops finally get into the bank and discover nothing has actually been stolen. Then Denzel's boss tells him just forget about the case no one really cares. But 50 people were taken hostage which is kidnapping and thus is a very serious offense and it was a big news story and just because no money was lost no one is going to be demanding police action? WTF? The movie seems to have this idea that the robbers really didn't do much wrong because they didn't steal any money this is reinforced at the end but that's just nuts. END SPOILER".

	schema:reviewBody "I went in to this film with high expectations due to the cast and whilst their performances were fairly good the film as a whole was not as great as I'd hoped. As a hostage movie I found The Negotiator with Sam Jackson far more entertaining and the start of Swordfish with Hugh Jackman far more exciting the worlds largest walking claymore mines. I found the story interesting but once I got the gist of what was going on I just found myself wanting to get to the end not really caring what happened along the way. As a bank robbery movie I found the whole process of Oceans 11 and Heat far more interesting and cerebral. I won't give anything away and talk about the ending but when it comes considering the fairly slow build up it is one of those oh right moments but it doesn't hit you like the ending of Planet of the Apes or The Usual Suspects. So to summarise an interesting journey but not one to add to your DVD collection for repeated viewing. It gets a 7 mainly for the 2 central performances from Owen  Washington and for Jodie foster looking great for once good riddance to those awful Silence of the Lambs FBI clothes".

The 410 are the most notorious of the street crews in Baltimore and are wanted by the police for their acts of vandalism and public mischief. Sarah threatens to send Andie to live with relatives in Texas unless she cleans up her act which includes ending her association with the 410 and trying harder at school. Andie's neighborhood friend Tyler Gage convinces Andie to audition for entry into the Maryland School of the Arts MSA an institution which ended up turning his life around for the better. Andie passes the audition but isn't sure she fits in there. The school's director Blake Collins isn't sure she fits in there either. Blake is a brilliant dancer but looks for conformity to his way.

Everything a entertaining mainstream movie has to have. The acting is mostly OK no major problems found although there are a lot of stereotypes used in the movie the handsome white guy the envious exgirlfriend the Looser the bad black guy.... But which movie doesn't have them? I also like the soundtrack a lot of good tracks can be hear with great dancing performances. This movie deserves 5 out of ten points!".

This kind of movie is obviously going to be a little bit predictable and cheesy but still it's fun to see with some friends on a Saturday night.Also the soundtrack really helped improve the movie there were many excellent cool songs playing throughout the film such as The Way I are by Timbaland and Low by Florida ft.

A range of mediocre acting phenomenal choreography and dancers simple and predictable plot and morals of the story.Predictability 1 Ballet is boring it is usually depicted as bland and too 'classical' in a film of this genre to young folks. The main character Andie is essentially a street nonprofessional hip hop dancer does not know how to interpret the classical music she is given by her teacher thus continues to do the style of dancing what she normally would to hip hop music its cute and funny. Later on it shows that all forms of dance make one great versatile dancer.2 Stereotype main character is a White girl. Not too many complains here because I was surprised to see they did not make it known or emphasis that fact that she was white who was enthusiastic about hip hop and street dancing. She was just there along with all the members of the '401 crew'.3 Mean black people. This one never fails. We have the angry high tempered black male of 401 and the supportive black girl Felicia that always stands behind her friend but later loses her patience and finally is fed up and gets an 'attitude' whether constantly covering up for Andie's absences was necessary or not is objective.4 Foreign accent student of any ethnicity. Jenny Kido has funny one liners although the humor mostly depends and derives from the broken English of said person  basically doesn't really have any real dialog throughout the whole movie.5 Cute Hispanic girl who from time to time speaks Spanglish. Missy whose family is almost painfully stereotypical said a few phrases in Spanish in the beginning of the film and wears stand out looking clothing.This was the first movie I ever saw where I subconsciously knew what was happening next during some moments envisioned in my head it seemed.

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I really wanted to like this movie. I loved Step Up and I was hoping that this movie would at least come close to the same level. But...it really didn't. Chemistry between the leads was missing...in fact chemistry between any of the characters was lacking. I am still not sure why they cared about each other at all. Also I felt like there was no point to the movie except to string a bunch of dance scenes together. There was no real growth on the part of Andi or the other characters. Maybe originally this movie was intended to show how someone from the streets could fit in...but I never saw Andi struggle. The dialogue was clich and boring and the minor characters while perhaps intended to add humor and depth did nothing for me.And then...the dancing.A lot of people have been raving about the dancing in this movie and saying that it is the only good thing about it. However...it was ALL THE SAME. There was hardly any variation when it came to style except for maybe five seconds of a mediocre ballet student. I felt like I was looking at the same dance over and over and over again with the moves slightly reshuffled. The one exception was the final dance which I did enjoy watching. At least the original Step Up combined different types of dancing to some extent that was completely lacking here.In short...stay at home and save your 12 bucks and if you're looking for a dance movie go back and watch the original movie again. This isn't worth it.".

I'll start with the message. The message is to be yourself and not conform to what other people think and feel. You know why I have a problem with that? It's because when you go to get a high education it's ALL about conforming. That's why you go. To understand someone ELSE'S rules and follow them so you can be successful in someone else's world. Because this is not YOUR world. Right now this is a white man's world and that's not going to change any time soon. If you don't want to conform that you don't have to. But don't try and change an entire organization that was perfectly content with the way they ran things before you came along. 6 or 7 people should not change how an organization of thousands of people operate. That's just reality. This is a dreamers movie. I also don't care for the characters. You've got this white girl with this chip on her shoulder who can dish it out but can't take it. She feels she can make fun of someone and joke around but when someone does the same to her she goes all you hole on us. I hate that. Girls shouldn't behave that way. If you want to talk smack them be prepared for it to come right back at you. She is part of a group of ignorant teenagers with bad style. The ring leader of this group is violent but can't do anything by himself. He's got to have his friends by his side before beating on someone which is cowardly and stupid. You can't hold respect for these characters. They are all shallow and idiotic. Honestly only teenagers can identify with this movie. But mature educated people know that this type of attitude about life will land these characters exactly where they dance the streets.".

She gathers a group to impress an underground street dance competition. I don't even bother about the story plot. It is simple nothing you cannot understand.

A few simple plot changes would have given the storyline the level of emotional intelligence that even a cartoon deserves.

It's Where You're At.Considering the fact that I haven't see the first one nor do I want to I really have nothing else to compare this movie too and because of this it stands alone. Step Up 2 the Streets brings not only the best dancing I have ever seen on screen aside from White Nights I guess but what it does is it proves that even with a moderate script you can still present something remarkable with the right kind of characters and good pacing.The whole concept about following you're heart is a load of bull and has been done many times before but it was however never mentioned in the film which I was very pleased about. To a reasonable extent I enjoyed most of the characters and the talented actors that really developed their characters. I can imagine it being extremely difficult to finds actors that can not only act but have incredible dancing abilities. It's because of their talent that I can over look the fact that a lot of them look older than their character's age.What I mean about good pacing is that because I watched this movie at three o'clock in the morning I never once felt that something felt out of place or that this was more dancing than story or vice versa. I was kind of tired and if any film can keep me up long enough to watch the whole thing then it will have my praise. WARNING SPOILERS  FROM ANOTHER MOVIEI remember the first time I watched Jeepers Creepers which I watched around the same time as this film. I was about half way through when the monster was finally in the open and it turned out to be some indestructible monster with wings. It was after that that I decided to stop the movie at wait until morning to finish the movie. I didn't have that problem with Step Up 2 the Streets.I give it too the critics that the ending was it's weakest point and had the potential to conclude with a better punch but that wasn't a big problem because I found that I didn't want the end too come because I was so in to the story of these characters and the fantastic variety of dancing.I would just recommend to watch this movie with an open mind. Try not to right away hate or love anything about it until the movie ends and then ask yourself was this movie worth watching?

I admire the work Nick Gomez and Spike Lee put into this masterpiece of a movie. This movie made quite an impression on me because of its realness and its appreciation of detail of life in urban New Jersey. It struck a chord with me personally because I grew up with friends like those depicted in the movie. It further made an impression with me because I used to spend time in Teaneck several years ago so some of the characters were kept real. At times this movie seemed like a documentary because you didn't know whether or not these were real events taking place. Although movies like Boys in the Hood and Menace II Society grab more attention I personally feel these movies were somewhat enhanced to appeal to a broader audience. New Jersey Drive was an uncompromising piece of in your face reality. Lee and Gomez covered every detail in this urban drama from the music clothing slang and location.Unlike some of the movies I mentioned earlier the actors performed as if they weren't actors. Nothing was compromised in order to make good theater. The only misfortune to come from this movie was the fact that many people slept on it. I look forward to more works of art from Nick and Spike in the hopefully near future.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie brings to mind Boys 'n the Hood Menace to Society South Central and others of its ilk and even shares actors with some of them. The film's us vs. the law mentality is underscored by the allblack neighborhood vs. the nearly allwhite police force. Here the cops are so bad they seem like caricatures and in one scene they even ambush the boys as they drive by in a car they've just liberated from its owner. It's like a bushwhacking from an old Western but the contemporary setting makes it look all too real.The story centers on young Jason Petty and his buddies to whom school is just an inconvenience that takes time away from their real occupation of boosting cars. This happens to be Newark N.J. a rustbelt city low on jobs but notoriously high on crime. In fact the problem is so severe that the cops all have Car Theft written on their backs to show that an entire unit must be devoted to this particular crime.The boys use a slim Jim to gleefully break into cars and go joyriding as if it's no big deal. They only run into real trouble when the police ambush them. The vicious Nazilike Lt. has a vendetta against the boys seeing them not as human beings who might be worthy of redemption but as human targets. In fact he's a little reminiscent of that sadistic Nazi officer of the Warsaw ghetto who shot down Jews for pleasure in the film Schindler's List. When the boys steal a police car in retribution for the ambush things predictably go downhill fast. They are severely beaten by the cops and Jason finally ends up in prison. Clearly these are bad boys who'd steal your car in a minute but the film wants us to see them as antiheroes showing Jason protecting his sister and his friend taking care of his own grandmother. The film left us wondering whose side to take and who to feel sadder for the boys whose lives are going down the drain the honest citizens whose cars are being stolen left and right and who could be caught in the crossfire of a shootout at any moment or the city of Newark itself the spirit of whose law is being betrayed by brutal souldead cops.In spite of the overthetop portrayal of the latter the film offers a realisticlooking rendering of the ghetto of the protagonists and their families and of the culture of car theft in a city where there appears to be only 2 career paths  law enforcement and crime. Strangely the entire subject of drugs is never mentioned.The filmmakers including producer Spike Lee are obviously biased against the Newark police who we hope are not as bad they are portrayed here. Nevertheless they've given us yet another a strong affecting story about the inner city and black youth gone awry and Sharron Corley is fine as Jason.".

The trouble starts when they steal a police car and the cops launch a violent offensive that involves beating and even shooting suspects.Mayor Sharpe James refused to allow filming of New Jersey Drive within the city limits therefore the filming locations were in the surrounding locations of Newark rather than the city itself. I am surprised they would turn down the shooting... but hey I guess if you're known for being a car theft city you don't want to support that claim.Some have called this the best hood movie. I don't know. I liked it and thought it seemed fairly accurate to how I imagine life in the streets to be. But it lacked a solid plot or story arc and I think it suffers from that. I do like how it has no real hero  both the thieves and the police come off as less than perfect.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this 1995 film writerdirector Nick Gomez brings to the screen a wonderful film that captures the essence of inner city life and crime in Newark New Jersey. Car theft and joyriding is a thrilling experience for many teens as they courageously face the mean streets while trying to survive and overcome many obstacles. The story begins by introducing us to Jason Petty a tough yet decent teen who like many of his friends gets his kicks out of stealing cars and having fun. As he tells the story from his point of view Jason exposes us to how he and most of his friends deal with the unfortunate every day occurrences in their neighborhood. From gun violence to police corruption to juvenile detention and the death of close friends there is nothing positive for these kids to look forward to. The acting is incredibly believable if not downright brilliant. Since the film is set in the New Jersey ghetto the urban vernacular and the overall dialogue is truly fantastic. The cast includes Sharron Corley Gabriel Casseus Donald Faison of Scrubs and a cameo appearance of the late hip hop artist Heavy D.333".

In fact Mayor James refused to have any footage of the movie shot within Newark city limits taking away a good part of the movies authenticity!The movie starts with a carjacking gone bad that ends up putting one of the carjackers Ronnie Lambs Koran C. Thomasin the hospital on life support. Lambs and his fellow carjackers unknowingly carjacked tough take no BS Newark cop Emil Rosco's Saul Stein car. It was Officer Rosco who just happened to be on the scene when Ronnie and his friends were ambushed in a police string. Shot four times by Rosco Ronnie now in the hospital and no gun found on him has Rosco in deep trouble with the only witness to the shooting fellow carjacker Jason Petty Shannon Corley slated to testify against him before the grand jury!This all sets the stage for Rosco hounding Jason all throughout the movie to get him to change his testimony. As for Jason he gives Rosco and the Newark Police all the rope they need to hang him by continuously going out with his friends carjacking cars thus putting his and their lives as well as freedom in jeopardy. Jason's mom Rene Petty Gwen McGee knows that her son is out stealing cars instead of going to school but try as she does Rene can't convince him that he'll end up either dead or behind bars as a result of his actions. It's later when his straight as an arrow sister Jackie Samantha Brown starts to hang out with the same crowd that Jason does that he throws a fit that almost has him gunned down by her new found Gangsta boyfriend Ritchie Andre Moore.

SPOILERS Spending 90 days behind bars in a juvenile dentition center Jason finally saw the light and decided to go back to school and put his life of crime behind him. The fact that Officer Rosco was indited in the Ronnie Lambs shooting helps also in Jason now not having to worry about Rosco framing or working him over which he did a number of time in the movie to keep him from talking. It was in fact Midget's fiery death is a stolen car chased by police that finally convinced Jason that he was right in his decision to go straight! It was Jasons refusal to join Midget and his friends in this latest carjacking caper that ended up saving his life!".

He strolls around his dirty prison cell in his pants and gets served a bowl of filthy looking rice with a cockroach crawling around in it. From scene one we can tell this isn't going to be a pretty looking film. Whilst beating up prison guards we hear his voiceover saying he 'never could stand bullies' and because of this his first job was freeing circus animals from their cages.He got into crime from an early age stealing heaters and other electrical equipment to sell on. Because of his downright thuggery he gets sent to a juvenile detention centre where he eventually becomes the boss of the Comasina which is a district in Milan.Bank robber Vallanzasca has a gang of not so merry men including crackpot best friend Enzo played by Filippo Timi. They seem to enjoy nothing more than to terrorise the poor folk of Milan committing murders robberies and kidnappings while profits are spent on women and drugs.They finally have it out with their rival Francis Turatello and Vallanzasca's team hold wealthy residents to ransom. As you can imagine things get a little messy.Kim Rossi Stuart has a lot of charm mixed with a crazy brutality and a great face to slap on the front of a newspaper. There's a fantastic scene where Vallanzasca dresses as a business man and just strolls straight through into the bank's back room to help himself and it's only with this charm that he manages to go through with it.There is a bit of a trend in Eurocrime dramas recently and if you want to see a better and grittier prison film check out A Prophet.Michele Placido is not a stranger to the crimedrama genre and we're left feeling that he could have made more from this. Angels of Evil could possibly have benefited from being a tad shorter and with six writers on the project could it have been a case of too many pens spoil the screenplay? It's a decent film and worth a watch with its grimy story charting the rise and fall of a well known gangster but it's been done better before.The disc is great with special features including a making of featurette an interview with Stuart and a few deleted and extended scenes thrown in there for good measure.".

He tells us about his childhood were early on he his little brothers sister and friends started stealing things and selling them. One day he finds one of his brothers dead. In adulthood he and his team start robbing armored cars. But he's a peaceful criminal who avoids violence. They have guns just to intimidate people. Eventually he ends up in jail.When he's out he he reunites with his gang. They club do drugs drink women etc. He eventually meets a girl with whom he has a son. At one club they run into the big crime boss in Milan named Turatello. He happens to be with Vallanzasca's sister whom he hasn't seen in years. So they reunite as well. They quickly start the business of robbing banks and start provoking Turatello by robbing his casino. But now Vallanzasca buddies start getting violent they kill people against his wishes. They start kidnapping rich folk and other higher stake crimes.They plan their most complex heist yetrobbing the tax office in downtown Milan. While Vallanzasca is inside the office impersonating some high officer his friends are spotted outside by cops and bullets start flying. There are victims on both sides and now the gang has to lay low. At a checkpoint Vallanzasca is shot in the butt and eventually caught. This leads to a longer stint in jail the same jail where Turatello is now. And what starts with some tense moments between the two ends up in a great friendship with Turatello taking Vallanzasca under his wing. There are trials and lots of people turn against Vallanzasca. He's not reluctant to use violence anymore and through Turatello takes revenge on all those who flipped. He also gets married in jail as scores of women fall for him. He becomes a public figure a media darling constantly taunting the police. But the cycle of violence catches up with him as Turatello isn't immune.During a transfer Vallanzasca who's always promised he'll escape actually manages to do so. His family offer support he ends up giving a radio interview but at this point he's subject of the largest manhunt in Italy.Angel of Evil is unmistakably an Italian movieit's loud as no one speaks but only screams. It's much more interested in these fast screaming litanies than in showing us some action. And it's more concerned with the several jail stints than with the actual crimes. An Italian version of Heat this is not unfortunately. Initially things are pretty confusing scenes are short characters aren't established except for the lead. Once things calm down a bit about an hour into the movie you also start liking the movie a bit more.The second major weaknesses of this film is that it tries so desperately hard to establish the lead as a charismatic brilliant criminal angelic leader of thugs ladies man seducer of the entire nation master manipulator of individuals and masses. Instead of looking like an Italian member of a gang they want him to be some American super individualistic cowboy. And thus they missed an opportunity to make a great action thriller crime drama centered on a group of interesting criminals. We learn nothing about his crew we can't even tell them apart let alone learn their names. Some of this may have to do with the fact that the lead actor was also involved in the script. This movie could have been strong as a buddyteam crime saga.Angel of Evil is two hours long but it does feel much longer. Based on real life events this could have been an outstanding movie but they really missed their chance here.".

	schema:headline " Audie Murphy's Last Western Is Pretty Mediocre";
	schema:reviewBody "Cimarron Kid director Budd Boetticher's last western A Time for Dying shares a common narrative thread with his cult Randolph Scott sagebrushers from the 1950s. The stark outdoors action unfolds as part of a journey of selfdiscovery and initiation for the twentysomething hero and heroine in the rugged southwest. Indeed this picaresque adventure follows a young man who is swift on the draw with his sixguns and later a young girl who becomes his wife as they make their way to and from the notorious Texas town of Silver City. Along the way our hero and heroine encounter two prominent historical figures Jesse James and Judge Roy Bean.Sadly this 67minute Boetticher picture lacks those classic qualities that distinguished his earlier oaters. The characters are sympathetic but far from charismatic. The actor and actress were unknowns. Audie Murphy who produced this low budget film appears briefly as the infamous Jessie James and his presence marginally enhances the film while Victory Jory all but steals the show with his hillbilly portrayal of the infamous hanging judge. A Time for Dying suffers too from a downbeat ending.A Time for Dying opens with a sharp shooting horseman Cass Dunning Richard Lapp of Barquero blasting the head off a rattlesnake apparently a real 'live' rattlesnake as it is about to strike a baby rabbit. Three riders confront Cass and warn him about wearing his matched pair of sixguns tied down when he rides into nearby Silver City. When Cass challenges Billy Pimple Robert Random of Time Walker about this Silver City rule Pimple points out that he is the exception to the rule and slaps his Colt revolver that he affectionately calls 'Thunder' and 'Lightning.' Later Cass encounters this predicament in a Silver City saloon when the patrons and the barkeep warn him about wearing sidearms tied down. Before Pimple and his cohorts ride away Pimple tells Cass about the new girl scheduled to arrive in Silver City. She is going to be employed at Mamie's brothel and everybody is awaiting her arrival. Anyway Cass spots the picture of the girl that Pimple was talking about in the saloon and he asks the barkeep and patrons about Billy Pimple. The barkeep says that Pimple is itching to be the next Billy the Kid and has 'the deposition of a rattlesnake in the sun.' Pimple had bought everybody drinks on the house because he was such a sharp shooter himself. Cass demonstrates his prowess with a pistol and the barkeep clamors that Cass' shooting skills surpass Pimple.When the stagecoach arrives Cass rides to Nellie Winter's Anne Randall of The Split rescue and carries her off with him.

	onyx:emotionText "Cimarron Kid director Budd Boetticher's last western A Time for Dying shares a common narrative thread with his cult Randolph Scott sagebrushers from the 1950s. The stark outdoors action unfolds as part of a journey of selfdiscovery and initiation for the twentysomething hero and heroine in the rugged southwest. Indeed this picaresque adventure follows a young man who is swift on the draw with his sixguns and later a young girl who becomes his wife as they make their way to and from the notorious Texas town of Silver City. Along the way our hero and heroine encounter two prominent historical figures Jesse James and Judge Roy Bean.Sadly this 67minute Boetticher picture lacks those classic qualities that distinguished his earlier oaters. The characters are sympathetic but far from charismatic. The actor and actress were unknowns. Audie Murphy who produced this low budget film appears briefly as the infamous Jessie James and his presence marginally enhances the film while Victory Jory all but steals the show with his hillbilly portrayal of the infamous hanging judge. A Time for Dying suffers too from a downbeat ending.A Time for Dying opens with a sharp shooting horseman Cass Dunning Richard Lapp of Barquero blasting the head off a rattlesnake apparently a real 'live' rattlesnake as it is about to strike a baby rabbit. Three riders confront Cass and warn him about wearing his matched pair of sixguns tied down when he rides into nearby Silver City. When Cass challenges Billy Pimple Robert Random of Time Walker about this Silver City rule Pimple points out that he is the exception to the rule and slaps his Colt revolver that he affectionately calls 'Thunder' and 'Lightning.' Later Cass encounters this predicament in a Silver City saloon when the patrons and the barkeep warn him about wearing sidearms tied down. Before Pimple and his cohorts ride away Pimple tells Cass about the new girl scheduled to arrive in Silver City. She is going to be employed at Mamie's brothel and everybody is awaiting her arrival. Anyway Cass spots the picture of the girl that Pimple was talking about in the saloon and he asks the barkeep and patrons about Billy Pimple. The barkeep says that Pimple is itching to be the next Billy the Kid and has 'the deposition of a rattlesnake in the sun.' Pimple had bought everybody drinks on the house because he was such a sharp shooter himself. Cass demonstrates his prowess with a pistol and the barkeep clamors that Cass' shooting skills surpass Pimple.When the stagecoach arrives Cass rides to Nellie Winter's Anne Randall of The Split rescue and carries her off with him. Nellie explains that she has had a difficult time finding a decent job. She says A decent job doesn't always mean the men folks will stay decent. Cass tells her that he rescued her because Nellie is the prettiest girl that he has ever seen. Moreover he didn't want any of the men touching her. Cass has determined that he wants to become a bounty hunter. They ride into Vinegaroon Texas and check into a hotel.While Nellie sleeps in the bed with her clothes in the room Cass slumbers in the hallway with a chair tilted back against the wall and his Winchester cradled in his arms. Two of Judge Roy Bean's deputies surprise and disarm him and arrest Nellie and Cass because they have violated the 'indecent conduct' law of not registering as man and wife.

I actually prefer the action sequences in Dillinger to the famous ones from Bonnie  Clyde because they seem rougher more natural and less selfconscious. The shooting sequences in Bonnie  Clyde seem too choreographed and slightly pretentious in comparison. Another selling point for Dillinger is that it contains wonderful performances by Oates and Ben Johnson. Actually Ben Johnson almost steals the show as G Man Melvin Purvis. Even though they only have 1.5 scenes together Oates and Johnson complement each other nicely here.".

Forgive me for quoting my own review of Mann's film Milius taking his cue from Bonnie And Clyde from the earlier Lawrence Tierney film Dillinger and from the gaudy gangster films of Roger Corman fashioned a film that was both flashy yet homespun part unabashed Bmovie part evocation of American Gothic. Even his occasional tinkering with historical accuracy could be forgiven since it was clear he had a firm grasp on what the Dillinger phenomenon was really all about  'farm boy makes good by turning bad' is an undeniable folktheme of American life. And the brilliance of Warren Oates' performance in the Milius film is that Oates plays Dillinger like a runaway farmboy with a sense of humor and a quick temper who just happened to rob banks for a living. That's as much as you can give any professional criminal without lying about the nature of crime namely it's about stealing other peoples' money and hurting many of them in the process. Other reviewers have remarked this as a Bmovie  but it is intentionally so it never makes any pretense otherwise and that's important having decided to make a Bmovie leaves Milius with considerable leeway as to how far he wants to push any aspect of the material. So while it's hard to think of any particular dramatic highpoint of the film perhaps the scene where Dillinger and Purvis go to the same restaurant or the death of Pretty Boy Floyd? it's much harder to find any moment that really drags the film down  the pacing of the film is that of a Bmovie it moves! There's nothing exceptional about the cinematography or music or production design what we're left with are memorable performances by some of the greatest character actors in cinema at the time and an exciting story with enough savvy to trigger our emotions.Milius watched the Lawrence Tierney Dillinger and learned from it before starting this film Mann should have watched Milius' film over and over before starting Public Enemies. In any event this is still THE Dillinger story and and an entertaining action film as well.".

Johnson also narrates in part of the film.Oates does a fine job of playing Dillinger. Unfortunately  remember this is the '70s a decade in which the antihero was a full bloom  the film tends to make this crook into a sympathetic figure. The screenwriters tell us Hey folks see this criminal really wasn't a bad guy! Gve him some slack! Yeah right.A few minor acting notes Cloris Leachman gets third billing but only has a small role at the end as the famous Lady In Red. Michelle Phillips who made a name for herself as a member of the Mamas and Papas singing group did a nice job of acting better than I would have expected.I have seen three versions of Dillinger and all of them are good including this one.".

Unfortunately  remember this is the '70s a decade in which the antihero was a full bloom  the film tends to make this crook into a sympathetic figure. The screenwriters tell us Hey folks see this criminal really wasn't a bad guy! Gve him some slack! Yeah right.A few minor acting notes Cloris Leachman gets third billing but only has a small role at the end as the famous Lady In Red. Michelle Phillips who made a name for herself as a member of the Mamas and Papas singing group did a nice job of acting better than I would have expected.I have seen three versions of Dillinger and all of them are good including this one.";

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who visited driveins in the 1950s 60s and 70s must have seen a film or two by American International Pictures a distributor that resembled 1980s giant Cannon Films. Wherever moviegoers ventured AIP would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles  in the 50s came horror movies like 'Voodoo Woman' and 'The Undead' in the 60s were Frankie AvalonAnnette Funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like 'The Glory Stompers' and into the 70s AIP churned out grindhouselevel trash like 'Cannibal Girls' and 'Sugar Hill.''Dillinger' released in 1973 is one of the more 'highbrow' AIP efforts that capture the true spirit of drivein filmmaking it is one of those uneven overthetop flicks that satisfied the masses' thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned. On the whole 'Dillinger' is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable. Heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact 'Dillinger' was a fair effort by screenwriterdirector John Milius 'Magnum Force' but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career.The 109minute 'Dillinger'  epic for AIP's scope  follows the quest of FBI Midwest chief Melvin Purvis played by Academy Award winner Ben Johnson. Purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four FBI agents killed in a 1933 Kansas City ambush that helped gangster Frank Nash to escape justice. At large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber John Dillinger Warren Oates Pretty Boy Floyd Steve Kanaly and psychopath Baby Face Nelson Richard Dreyfuss. Dillinger eventually joined forces with Floyd and Nelson taking along Homer Van Meter Harry Dean Stanton and Harry Pierpont Geoffrey Lewis. He also hooked up with Billie Frechette Michelle Phillips a prostitute of French and Indian extraction. While taking place over several months in 19334 'Dillinger' is basically a chase film with Purvis's entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by J. Edgar Hoover.'Dillinger' has a documentary feel listing dates and places while Johnson supplies loose narrative as Purvis. Milius keeps an honest Depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also sprinkles around blackandwhite photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts. The film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace. The action scenes are Dillinger's strongpoint edited competently by Fred Feitshans Jr in his last professional effort. Thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives. This film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place. The violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on American life.This film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isn't there. John Milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action. The action scenes mostly bloodfilled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including 1967's 'Bonnie and Clyde.' But we simply don't get to know much about Dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between Dillinger and Frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward. Melvin Purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when Milius needs to keep the film from unraveling. All too often the film takes on a shoot'emup persona when its characters could have been explored in detail.Aside from this the picture's main crime is ignorance of historical fact. While many say that 'Dillinger' is just a film it's films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent. Those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that John Dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as Milius's screenplay and the film's documentary style encourage us to believe. In fact Dillinger died before Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have Billie Frechette in tow. While these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why Milius couldn't have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them.Warren Oates's performance as Dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing. Oates is humorous and nicely portrays how Dillinger became consumed by his largerthanlife image in the American press however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime. Ben Johnson gives some life to Purvis suave but rather flat. Michelle Phillips brings emotion to the Billie Frechette character and it's really too bad that Milius's screenplay didn't flesh out her relationship with Dillinger. We never learn what drew her to a coldblooded killer other than the stereotype of an easygoing girl who is attracted to men of danger. The supporting roles with Kanaly Dreyfuss Stanton Lewis and a brieflyappearing Cloris Leachman are acceptable for such talent.As a piece of 1970s exploitation 'Dillinger' appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where I picked up MGM's DVD release for 4.99. The film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drivein flicks with subtitles in French and Spanish. Dillinger's theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra. Largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drivein enthusiasts the film doesn't really call for much else in way of supplementary material. For fans of the genre it's certainly worth checking out. out of 4Roving Reviewer  www.geocities.compauljohnr".

Hollis had fired one of the rounds that hit Dillinger although not the fatal one and he and another agent died while mortally wounding Baby Face Nelson in November of that year.The scene outside the Biograph is ridiculous. It was scalding hot which is why Dillinger and the two women went to an airconditioned theater. The movie shows everyone in overcoats including Dillinger. He had on an opencollared shirt and a white straw hat. Purvis didn't shoot Dillinger at all the fatal round was fired by an agent brought up from Texas.I do however love the line about Handsome Jack Klutas who by the way attended college but had no college degree I knew I'd never take him alive. I didn't try too hard neither. That scene of course never happened. Purvis wasn't even there when Klutas was killed.".

	schema:headline " Milius epic with Oates has a lot going for it";

While dialog is often rough and cartoonish  you can almost feel Milius' strain as he attempts to write dialog that is both romantic and cynical for the love scenes between Oates and Phillips  the action scenes are top notch in both staging and execution. The cinematography is crisp and just lightly overstated Milius' direction is assured if never subtle and the performances rise well above the script.Although it's a rare pleasure to see the incomparable Warren Oates in a leading role this film is not as rewarding in that sense as Peckinpah's Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia from the following year. There's a feeling that Oates and Milius are a bit too concerned with making Dillinger a macho badass although they do a good job of showing how his farmboy roots shine through. A few too many scenes verge on heroworship. As good as Oates is I thought Ben Johnson was perhaps even more impressive particularly since he's been cast here well outside of his normal comfort zone. He's very impressive for example in a brief scene where he connects with a young boy who idolizes Dillinger and admits he wouldn't wanna be a Gman. Chinatown it is not. Milius stages mythology in an impressive manner but with no subtlety and very little flair. The film does have a special sort of quality about it but we don't feel the exhilaration that a good bankrobbing movie should impart. There's too much focus on the PhillipsOates relationship which begins with a beating rape and kidnapping and suddenly veers into romance. It's all very confusing and feels like much else in this film like a attempt to top the earlier Bonnie and Clyde dismissed in the film as amateurs.".

Even the gangsters' girlfriends were better shooters than the FBI guys! It's a pity that the opportunity was missed to make it more realistic in this regard. As far as wounds are concerned no complaints there quite realistic. It's also absurd how many of the gang escape the big shootout.

	schema:reviewBody "I loved every actor in this film. I was even impressed by michelle phillips acting. Warren Oates is one of my favorite actors but I felt at times he was a little less than believable in the role of Dillinger. Harry Dean Stanton and Richard Dreyfuss provided some lighter more amusing scenes such as the time at the gas station with the old man and when Baby Face joined the gang. The line by Dreyfuss where he says I don't take orders from anyone. I got my own way of taking banks. I go in take the money and kill everyone in sight was such an example of light humor in an otherwise violent and intense movie. What frustrates me in true stories most of the time is the historical inaccuracies. Harry Pierpont was executed by electrocution not killed by the cops on a bridge and Baby Face was killed 4 months after Dillinger. This in no way takes away from the greatness of this film and may have served to make the story in the film better.I have read some of the other comments to this movie and I am a little confused. This movie was not a documentary. I am a little frustrated by historical accuracies also but that doesn't take away from the point of a film. If this was a documentary I would have howled at them showing Baby Face or Homer Van Meter dying before John Dillinger. But it is not a documentary but an action packed portrayal of a much larger story. If you want to draw morals or statements from this type of film it would be a live by the sword die by the sword statement. If they showed for instance Jesse James dying at Northfield MN in a movie it would be historically inaccurate but not far from the fact of him eventually being killed in part of a much larger violent atmosphere.If you want historical accuracy read a book or more exciting primary documents if you want a sense of the violent atmosphere of the public enemy era in a short time while eating popcorn even watch a movie like Dillinger.Stories I have heard about the shootout in Mason City Iowa by the Dillinger gang and the shootout outside of Des Moines Iowa by the Clyde Barrow gang have served to make me obsessed with these stories since I grew up in Central Iowa.I recommend both Dillinger and Bonnie and Clyde because they are both great movies about Depression era outlaw gang life AKA public enemy era. If you had to choose only one I would pick Dillinger as the most believable and intense and Bonnie and Clyde for the acting although stilted action Warren Beatty plays an awesome Clyde Barrow. Bonnie and Clyde is more of a love story then the an action packed gang story of Dillinger hence the more contrived action scenes of the former.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Milius's DILLINGER is a hardcore fastpaced account of a GMan pursuing and getting his man one of the most notorious outlaws of the century.The problem the writerdirector faces when dealing with historical figures is what kind of movie do I want to make? Do I want to lionize the protagonist make him bigger than life a living myth? Or do I want to show a man with all the failings that implies struggling with the same emotions the rest of us do? Milius here chooses the latter approach and Warren Oates as Dillinger is never less than human exudes the requisite bark and menace but lacks to some degree the gravitas that would have been needed to make him a more imposing figure.The film unlike most of its kind doesn't bother to probe the psychological impulses that first drives an individual to crime. There are no flashbacks to Dillinger's childhood we are only shown his coming home to an average middleoftheroad American family and those unfamiliar with the true story will have to assume that John Dillinger the bank robber and outlaw is a natural byproduct of the Great Depression and the poverty that sweeps the nation. That sentiment is echoed in the scene in which Ben Johnson confronts a little boy. Used to be that cops cowboys and firefighters were boys' heroes. Well not no more they're not. The kid when told he has to go to school to be a GMan bluntly retorts that Dillinger didn't. But he's in jail! Purvis shoots back. The kid waves and walks away. Purvis is puzzled. Things have changed.Only later on during Dillinger's confrontations with Babyface Nelson do we get hints that Dillinger's bankrobbing spree is fueled by growing megalomania You can't kill me punk! I'm immortal! He has embraced the myth that sensationalized press accounts of his exploits have created and it becomes clear that Dillinger fancies himself a hero of the people a rebel fighting Hoover Roosevelt's New Deal and Big Government. The films remains evenhanded though never passing judgment on the central figure's morality or lack thereof though Dillinger himself is a little too often referred to as nice despite some proofs to the contrary. Purvis is not necessarily portrayed as an Elliott Nesslike paragon of morality either he's no arbiter of all that's just and good he's just a man on a mission  to avenge the Kansas City massacre in which several FBI agents perished at the hands of gangsters. DILLINGER is almost documentarylike in this way the viewer is presented with the facts however fictionalized for creative purposes and it's up to him to make up his mind though I'll admit I found myself rooting for Dillinger and his gang during the shootouts is the failing on my part or Milius's? Like all bankrobbery films the movie tends to be somewhat shapeless events happen in an elliptical fashion to mark the span of time between hits and the tension inbetween what is basically a succession of setpieces is relieved by quiet interludes of the wild bunch enjoying the fruits of their labor in the peaceful countryside. Another problem with the film is that Harry Dean Stanton apart none of Dillinger's partners in crime fully register with personalities of their own not even  most egregiously  Richard Dreyfus's Babyface Nelson.Ben Johnson as tough stonefaced FBI Agent Purvis brings the cool veteran assurance of a man biding his time to his role. If anything Johnson makes Purvis too tough almost invulnerable  never once letting a crack in his armor show  that it's hard to believe that such a man would later in life commit suicide with the gun he used on Dillinger.Michelle Phillips in her debut does a creditable job as a halfbreed former prostitute turned Dillinger's girlfriend and her attachment and devotion to her man is never less than credible bringing a certain kind of poignancy to her scenes with Oates. Aesthetically the film's compositions are pleasant if a tad too tightcropped and take full advantage of the barren scorched earth landscapes of Depressionera little towns. The archival footage newspaper clippings and older movie clips interspersed in the narrative gives the film its oftheera feel and further its newsreellike quality. As for the violent action sequences they are the highlights really staged Old West style a la Peckinpah fast and furious bouts of carnage mayhem and death punctuated by the mighty roar of Tommy guns.DILLINGER may in the end be too narrow in scope to fully do justice to as fascinating a figure as its eponymous antihero. Nevertheless it is a very watchable actioner a la Joseph H. Lewis's DEADLY IS THE FEMALE a.k.a. GUN CRAZY or the FBI STORY and true crime story fans should give it a try AFTER having seen such gangster classics as LITTLE CAESAR SCARFACE  SHAME OF A NATION PUBLIC ENEMY N.1 WHITE HEAT etc...".

With banks failing all over the country and people losing their life savings bankers were not among the most popular people in the USA in the Thirties. No matter that these robberies didn't help the situation any a lot of people were glad someone besides the rich was just going in and taking the money.Ben Johnson is a grim and determined Melvin Purvis eager to the shooting down of FBI men in the Kansas City Massacre before J. Edgar Hoover's agents were allowed to carry weapons. He did not however personally bag all the criminals he's credited with in this film. Nor did Pretty Boy Floyd played by Steve Kanaly later of Dallas ever run with Dillinger's gang. However Baby Face Nelson aka Lester Gillis did and he's played as the psychotic punk he was by Richard Dreyfuss before he became a star.There's no real character development in this Dillinger but certainly enough action to satisfy those who want that in their movies. The film has a documentary like quality to it. The main female roles are played by Michelle Phillips as Dillinger's girl Billie who stands by her man and in the end Cloris Leachman as the infamous Lady in Red who betrays him. Neither actress is given much to work with in the script.I'm looking forward to the new Dillinger film with Johnny Depp this year. Knowing him we'll get one interesting Dillinger. Still Warren Oates is the best we have so far.".

Although it claims to be a kind of biography of Dillinger you learn very little about him. The movie starts in the middle of his crime spree so you don't see what lead him into that life. And from what you see of him here he comes across little better than a gunhappy thug who is into abusing his girlfriend  surely the real Dillinger was more interesting than that. For that matter you learn little if anything of Melvin Purvis or the other reallife figures involved here. They are all pretty bland characters who have one role either to pursue and eliminate evil or escape from the law and rob banks. In fact it's near impossible to tell the Dillinger gang members apart! The script is not just weak in giving character development the story is also poorly told with the story jumping around from place to place before we can catch our breath and properly digest what happened. Characters disappear and suddenly appear and the story often jumps months ahead without bothering to tell us what happened during that time.This was Milius' first job as a director. He got the job only because A.I.P. offered him his longdreamed goal of directing if he also wrote the script. I cannot help but think that Milius was so occupied in preparing to direct that he didn't give himself enough time to polish his script.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly Fun and Entertaining Gangster Film";
	schema:reviewBody "John Dillinger Warren Oates and his gang go on a bank robbing spree across the Midwest but one GMan Ben Johnson is determined to bring him down.Following Bonnie and Clyde and The Wild Bunch American International Pictures wanted their own violent gangster film. Producer Sam Arkoff hired the thenunknown writer John Milius to construct the script. An earlier very rough version of the script had come in to producer Lawrence Gordon and Gordon thought Milius  his former assistant  would be right for the job.A little research and a solid script would make this an excellent story but those involved went one step better. Retired FBI Agent Clarence O. Hurt 18971975 one of the agents involved in the final shootout with Dillinger was the film's technical adviser. Hurt had a distinguished career in the gangster era also being one of the men who brought in Alvin Creepy Karpis. Interestingly Hurt's house was burgled during his funeral  the newspapers liked to say this was the underworld's belated revenge.In order to save money Arkoff was always cutting corners Milius was also offered the director's chair so that AIP would only have to pay one man rather than two. Gordon says this was his idea but either way the reason was the same. Milius used John Ford as his inspiration and if you pay close attention you will see homages to Ford's My Darling Clementine.The casting of Oates was pure perfection.

	onyx:emotionText "John Dillinger Warren Oates and his gang go on a bank robbing spree across the Midwest but one GMan Ben Johnson is determined to bring him down.Following Bonnie and Clyde and The Wild Bunch American International Pictures wanted their own violent gangster film. Producer Sam Arkoff hired the thenunknown writer John Milius to construct the script. An earlier very rough version of the script had come in to producer Lawrence Gordon and Gordon thought Milius  his former assistant  would be right for the job.A little research and a solid script would make this an excellent story but those involved went one step better. Retired FBI Agent Clarence O. Hurt 18971975 one of the agents involved in the final shootout with Dillinger was the film's technical adviser. Hurt had a distinguished career in the gangster era also being one of the men who brought in Alvin Creepy Karpis. Interestingly Hurt's house was burgled during his funeral  the newspapers liked to say this was the underworld's belated revenge.In order to save money Arkoff was always cutting corners Milius was also offered the director's chair so that AIP would only have to pay one man rather than two. Gordon says this was his idea but either way the reason was the same. Milius used John Ford as his inspiration and if you pay close attention you will see homages to Ford's My Darling Clementine.The casting of Oates was pure perfection. Although many actors have portrayed John Dillinger before and since Oates actually resembles the man for the most part. Singer Michelle Phillips as Billie Frechette Dillinger's girlfriend came about by an old Hollywood trick lying. Phillips had told the producers she was half Indian to land her first acting gig.Arkoff wrote in his autobiography of the ways they saved money on this one besides the use of Milius AIP was also selling off the cars after the shoot.

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Mann's massively budgeted and heavily promoted Public Enemies was somewhat of a disappointment at least to me personally and thus I went searching for other cinematic versions of the John DillingerMelvin Purvis saga. I quickly came across this biopic and it immediately looked a lot more like my preference. Dillinger is an early 70's film the best era for cinema with a splendid cast and an incredibly violent character. I don't know why exactly but back in the seventies they were better at recreating the desolate and grim 1930's Depression Era than they are nowadays. The atmosphere and scenery used in Dillinger feels a lot more authentic than in Public Enemies despite the fact this AIPproduction probably didn't even cost one tenth to make. The life story of John Dillinger is wellknown. He was an eloquent but dangerous bank robber in the Midwest area during the Depression era but became particularly immortal when he was declared public enemy number one by the FBI and idolized by the newspapers and media. Dillinger always collaborated with loyal and almost equally infamous partners Homer Van Meter Harry Pierpont Baby Face Nelson Pretty Boy Floyd and wasn't ashamed to make public appearances with his girlfriend Billie. Melvis Purvis head of the Chicago bureau and right hand of FBI boss J. Edgar Hoover devoted himself to capturing and killing Dillinger and his gang. The film is narrated in a more or less chronological order with the emphasis lying on Dillinger's ego and Purvis' personal vendetta. Most of the criticism towards Dillinger comes from people claiming the script penned down by director John Milius isn't always fully accurate. Probably so but this merely concerns unessential details and  besides  if all movies based on true stories would be 100 accurate they would be called documentaries instead. I believe the facts are only slightly altered and that strictly for entertainment purposes. The bank robberies and shootouts naturally form the highlights of the movie. They are quite extended and very VERY violent. Multiple cops and robbers are literally perforated with machine gun ammunition and John Milius blatantly depicts the bloody carnage of these battles. The soundtrack is great and very apt with The Gold Diggers' Song and Happy Days are Here Again. The casting is extraordinary. With his rough looks and almost naturally criminal charisma Warren Oates is the best imaginable choice ever to play John Dillinger. If you look up some pictures of the real John Dillinger you'll be stunned by the resemblance he bears with Warren Oates. I love Johnny Depp and all but this role belongs to Oates forevermore. Ben Johnson is terrific as FBI man Melvin Purvis and Michelle Phillips 14th of The Mamas and the Papas is quite convincing in her film debut as the loveinterest Billie. Furthermore there are several fantastic supportive roles for Harry Dean Stanton one of the most underrated actors ever as Homer Van Meter Geoffrey Lewis as Harry Pierpont and a very young and hardly recognizable Richard Dreyfuss as the illtempered and nasty Baby Face Nelson.".

He wants us to know that he's doing a service with this robbery by gracing us with his celebrity.If the rest of the movie was as clever and gripping at its first 90 seconds Dillinger would be remembered today as a firstrate crime movie instead of a chaotic pit stop by one of the wildest and most singular characters of the auteur era John Milius. With all it has going for it you want Dillinger to be more than it ever manages to be.Milius loved violence in films. Dillinger is a raucous epic of criminal violence inspired by thenrecent badguy films like Bonnie And Clyde and Butch Cassidy  The Sundance Kid. It's clear from the casting of Oates and of Ben Johnson as Dillinger's nemesis Melvin Purvis that the film he really wanted to make was The Wild Bunch. It's here Dillinger falls apart.Wild Bunch is a movie about bad men where loyalty and interpersonal relationships dominate until the bloody end. You see them as people running out of options and care about them enough that what happens to them matters. Dillinger is in such a hurry to get to the bloodshed that it sidesteps the characterization until it's too late. Dillinger is surrounded by henchmen but most of them are just there for the stunts and squibs. The only person he has any time for is a woman he assaults until she loves him Billie Frechette Michelle Phillips. Watching him holler at her as she screams and cries is exhausting and pretty much all you get from Milius the scriptwriter in the way of relationship development.He lets himself go too easily is how one of his more thoughtful henchmen Pierpont Geoffrey Lewis explains it. Whether roughing up Billie or another hood with an even more dangerous reputation than himself Baby Face Nelson Richard Dreyfuss Dillinger as played by Oates is all snarling brawn and no brains.The violence here is visceral and energetic but it doesn't serve much of a purpose. Ultimately all that Dillinger and Dillinger is about is celebrity. Even Peckinpah didn't work in so nihilistic a vein.I'm already a murderer so I might as well be famous declares prisoner Reed Youngblood Frank McRae when running off with Dillinger. Later after Dillinger's fatal date at the Biograph Theater Milius lingers on a shot of a woman dipping her kerchief on a bloody wall symbolizing fame of a sort.Johnson does provide a strong presence even if Milius can't decide whether he's supposed to be a decent man or a glory hound. Perhaps he is a bit of both. Celebrity works both ways in this game. At least with Johnson you have a character you can understand at some level who understands the symbolic importance of stopping a famous criminal and pulls you in in his unshowy way. Oates a great actor doesn't have himself a great part here and it shows in the way his characterization meanders from that of a gentleman robber to a vicious killer.Being Milius you get some good lines amid the carnage. There are also some wellshot scenes of bucolic beauty by Jules Brenner which stand out more for the absence of anything interesting going on. Dillinger buries a comrade and talks about Jesse James Dillinger and Billie ponder a run to Mexico before returning to his life of crime. A life of sound and fury signifying nothing except celebrity which is in Dillinger turns out the biggest nothing of all.".

Did they ever have a romance off screen? They looked perfectly suited to one another physically.Favorite scenes take place up at a lake in Maine although I can't understand why Loretta's character leaves her friend the maid's character played with pizazz by Patsy Kelly alone naked on the shore friend had lost bathing suit in the water. Loretta instead of helping her takes off with Robert Taylor's character on his boat abandoning her friend. I'd never do that to my friend!. In fact that was the most annoying thing to me about the film Patsy Kelly was always supporting Loretta and Loretta never did anything to repay her.Basil Rathbone was downright scary as the butler. He was colder and more frightening here than he was with Greta Garbo in Anna Karenina and that's saying a lot! I like the way Loretta shudders in the beginning after she first meets the butler. It made me laugh. Listen to your instincts girl leave! But no she's coaxed into staying by Patsy Kelly's character Gracie.Monroe Owsley has a small but impressive role as James Coakley a weak scoundrel on the make. He was to die only a year later after a car crash. Jane Darwell and Billy Bevan put in appearances as servants. Marjorie Gateson did well in the role of Robert Taylor's mother. Also worthy of note is the beautiful large dog Prince played by Hamlet. I would love to have an affectionate dog like that! I wonder who his trainer was? He was adorable. When he puts his paw up on Loretta at one point to comfort her I sighed Awwwwww! 8 out of 10 stars.".

	schema:headline " And The Villain Still Pursued Her";
	schema:reviewBody "In a film that was primarily a vehicle for Loretta Young I'm guessing that Darryl Zanuck did not want to use his favorite leading man Tyrone Power in this remake of Common Clay. Power and Young did do several films together in the Thirties but they were either equal vehicles or Power predominated. So Zanuck got the services of Robert Taylor who was the MGM equivalent of Power for Private Number.Or it's possible that Power also took a look at the script and realized that the part Basil Rathbone had would be a show stealer. Or that Basil Rathbone would make it one as the villainous and lecherous butler is the kind of role Rathbone could really sink his teeth into.Certainly the part is out of the Snidely Whiplash tradition of villains. Rathbone is the tyrannical butler who rules the house servants with an iron hand including 20 kickbacks on their salaries of which the clueless masters Paul Harvey and Marjorie Gateson know nothing and for reasons I can't figure out no one is telling them or complaining. The only who raises her voice to Rathbone is cook Jane Darwell.When Loretta Young arrives looking for work Rathbone in true stage villain tradition is willing to forget the kickback for other considerations. But Young catches the eye of Robert Taylor as Harvey's and Gateson's son. They marry in secret and Young keeps her pregnancy a secret for as long as she can.With Rathbone playing Iago as well as Snidely Whiplash to the parents they move for an annulment. It all gets rather messy in court but of course it all works out for the course of true love.Young is certainly beautiful and who wouldn't fall for her. Only toward the end is Taylor given anything to do that requires any real acting on his part. Patsy Kelly playing Patsy Kelly is also fine as Young's best friend. But the one you will really remember from Private Number is Basil Rathbone.".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this movie on FOX . I love these old flicks. Lorreta Young plays a maid working for the woman of the house. You know there is going to be a problem because in the beginning Young runs into this man and they flirt with each other. It turns out he is the son of her employer. In the meantime we meet the Basil Rathborn character who plays the Butler the supervisor of the staff. It doesn't take long for us to see what kind of weasel he is. You see he is pocketing part of the checks of the staff. One poor guy asks if he can not take any money out for one week because of a family problem the weasel tells him no. But as soon as the Lortta Young character comes to get her pay we see he fancies her and is willing to help her. She goes out with a fellow maid played by Patsy Kely the sense and brains of the movie. THey go to meet a date and trouble ensues when one gets in a fight. Lorreta Youngs purse gets swiped and she is without any money to get home. The man who swiped her wallet offers to help her. They end up going to his grandmas some house of ill repute. ANother raid happens she gets arrested and calls the weasel to bail her out. He does..BIG MISTAKE. She goes to Maine with the family for the summer and she and the son fall in love and secretly get married. Here lies the problem the weasel is mad because Young rejected him so he has another girlfriend. He finds out about Young being pregnant and tells her employer. They are shocked to find out it is the sons kid. The mother seems pretty cool it is the father that is the real bastard. The mother likes Loreta Young only when the WEASLE tells the secret about him bailing her out does the mother get alarmed. Now the family thinks she is just a floozy looking for money and soon the son believes it too. She has the baby and seems to be doing well until Gracie her maid friend who quit when she heard her employers talking bad about Young shows her a newspaper about her being a gold digger. After she gets served with divorce papers. They begin a war now. Fire with Fire. I am not going to tell the end. All Iam going to say is that we get the usual march in time newspaper headlines and there is a trial. This is a good role for Lorreta Young and a very young Robert Taylor as the son. Basil Rathborn plays the perfect weasel and Patsy Kelly plays a friend we all would love to have. She is loyal and even risks her job for her friend. She sticks with her after she has the baby and gets her a lawyer and tells her to fight..her kid is being called bastards now. Patsy brings along her crazy friends for the ride. She is the star of the movie IMHO. Very good movie wish I could get on DVD. Also Lorreta Young is suppose to be 17 she looks around 27 This is a movie made after code but I am very surprised.".

	schema:headline " Fine Performances Overcome a Creaky Script";
	schema:reviewBody "Common Clay a play by Cleves Kincaid opened in August of 1915 on Broadway. It was relatively successful and ran for 316 performances. In 1919 a silent film of the stage play was released starring Fannie Ward as Ellen and W. E. Lawrence as Hugh. Common Clay was filmed again as a talkie in 1930 starring Constance Bennett and Lew Ayres. Both films were well reviewed with the New York Times commenting on the 1919 film as the amazing adventures of 'that common clay girl' are still amazing and Miss Ward and her company first wring and then cheer the hearts of their spectators. March 3 1919.The 1930 version of the film was precode and had a number of racy elements. The 1936 version retitled Private Number was cleaned up slimmed down and simplified. Some of the character names were changed. The new title is a complete mystery since telephones don't enter into the story at all. Although Robert Taylor received top billing the film actually belongs to Loretta Young. Ms. Young portrays a young girl down on her luck and penniless who becomes a maid for a wealthy family. Basil Rathbone is delightfully slimy as the lecherous and crooked butler for whom Ms. Young works.Of course Ms. Young Ellen and Mr. Taylor Dick the Winfield's son fall in love. The progress of their romance at the family's summer house in Maine is photographed beautifully. Ms. Young looks gorgeous in a bathing suit a long gown and her maid's outfit. Mr. Taylor wearing far too much makeup as he did in those days is nonetheless affecting as the lovestruck college boy. Both stars combine physical beauty with polished performances. Patsy Kelly is always good and she is very good here as Ms. Young's fellow maid and friend. Marjorie Gateson and Paul Harvey are stuffy but sympathetic as Mr. and Mrs. Winfield Dick's parents. Prince a Great Dane is excellent as Hamlet a Great Dane.In the earlier versions Hugh now Dick loves Ellen and leaves her high and dry and pregnant when he goes back to college. In Private Number they marry and she makes him go back to finish his degree. Although the acting continues to be first rate as is the direction and cinematography the script creaks along from one implausibility to another. Probably the worst one is when Ellen is thrown out of the Winfield's home and fetches up immediately in a lovely farmhouse that someone never specified has lent her.It all comes to a climax in a totally unbelievable but nonetheless absorbing trial where evildoers are unmasked and justice triumphs. At the end of the film Ms. Young forgives Mr. Taylor for not trusting her and they go into a final clinch.Private Number shouldn't be a good movie but it is. The creaky script is more than made up for by the direction by Roy del Ruth the extraordinary visuals and the thoroughly professional acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of the few Robert Taylor films where he actually does a decent job with the role he's give. This is Loretta Young's film though...with a splash of Patsy Kelly and a huge dog thrown in.Loretta come comes to the big city to find work and decides to try being a maid at a rich family's home. With the help of Patsy Kelly she gets in he door to talk to the creepy head of the servants...the butler played by Basil Rathbone. He's a scheming sort and goes for her in a big way but she always manages to skirt the issue around him. She finally meets the family's son and that's it. They fall in love and that's it. Well...almost.This is a decent enough picture. Normally I don't do to well with Robert Taylor but in this he gets by. This along with maybe Johnny Eager are probably the only films I can swallow with him in it. In this he goes without a mustache and honestly I think he looks way better. Loretta Young is a fine actress and she always brings you into her innocence in her films. Patsy Kelly is just the same as always. A wisecracker with the best lines in the film. She's a spark plug throughout this. Basil Rathbone really plays the smarmy head butler very well. So well you'll hate him. The dog a huge great dane is just a star all the way. Watch all his gestures. Most of the scenes he's in seem so natural and not set up with a trainer. This big sucker had personality.Throughout this film was good but towards the end it just gets to be a bit...yeah rightish. There are scenes where if the character would speak up a lot of what happens would work themselves out but they up the snobbery and bossiness to keep it going. The end takes place in a court room to annul the marriage and the groom doesn't even show up until the end of the trial. I mean the guy signs the annulment papers for it to go through and he's not in court the whole time? Come on. The court scenes are actually a laugh. Not really well done but acceptable. His whole family lies to get to point in court and they leave without an aftermath of all this. I mean they blatantly lie and no punishment. I thought lying in court was a crime. Not in this film. They just let it slide without an outcome. Of course this is suppose to be a love story. Working class maid marries the rich son. Perfect for its day and age in the middle of the depression.Pretty good little film. Grab it and see a really young Loretta Young and Robert Taylor. Stay and watch it for Patsy Kelly and the huge Dog. You'll probably get a kick out of it like I did.".

	schema:reviewBody "In today's world imperious butler Basil Rathbone would be slammed immediately with a ton of sexual harassment suits and all sorts of other charges as he demands a take from the salary packets of each of the servants he hires and can fire at will. When first seen Rathbone is berating each of the staff for little things he considers unacceptable whether it be maid Patsy Kelly's hair or the condition of cook Jane Darwell's condition. Kelly is busy minding the birds when Loretta Young appears at a side door looking for a job. Rathbone obviously ogling her from the moment he turns around in his office and sees her offers her a position with a 15 a month cut then later makes his intentions clear when he saves her from the advances of a lecherous chauffeur. Young is promoted to the ladies' maid for the gracious mistress of the house Marjorie Gateson whose son Robert Taylor arrives home from college and is immediately enchanted by Young whom he believes is a party guest. After Rathbone gets Young out of a scrape with the law Young along with Kelly accompanies Gateson and Taylor to the country where a romance blossoms between ladies maid and the wealthy son leading to potential scandal where Rathbone uses Young's legal past against her.A light hearted first half turns a bit cold in the last few reels where Young must declare her innocence of any wrong doing and I found myself losing interest at that point. Up until then the film had been a mixture of upstairsdownstairs style drawing room comedy an American version of Downton Abbey with some interesting drama but then after a scene where the master of the house Paul Harvey accuses Young of luring his son into marriage it becomes an overly chatty courtroom mess where all the humor of the first half turned into gushy soap opera. As horrid as his character is Basil Rathbone is excellent an example of somebody abusing his power in every way he can. Gateson who could play society matrons both snobbish and dizzy makes her character here extremely likable an understanding woman of conscience who wants to stand up to imperious husband Harvey and support Young but feels trapped under his thumb. Taylor like Young seems too old to be believable as a college age student but I found them an attractive pairing together. As usual Patsy Kelly gives a raucous and scene stealing performance with Joe E. Lewis very funny as her date in one scene bringing along a shy toothy sailor actor unknown who can only say hello but can give a great punch when an intruder makes a pass at Young in front of him. The sequence involving obvious May Beatty seems like something out of another movie utilized only as leverage for Rathbone to have something on Young. This has a lot going for it but some twists in the screenplay prevents it from being as satisfying as it could have been.".

	schema:reviewBody "It doesn't take long to figure out who is going to be the archvillain. Basil Rathbone frequently played villains. For example he opposed Errol Flynn in fencing duels in Captain Blood and The Adventures of Robin Hood. Here he plays the imposing dictatorial Wroxton who functions as the butler in the mansion of Mr. and Mrs. Winfield. More importantly he is given the authority to hire and fire other household functionaries besides which he takes a cut of their salaries to insure his continued approval of their work. He is uncommonly stiff and formal and treats the staff as a drill sergeant treats his recruits. He reluctantly offers Loretta a job. She doesn't accept right away and is about to leave as she can't imagine working under the thumb of the zombielike Wroxton. However maid Patsy Kelly as Gracie flags her down and convinces her to give it a try. Patsy becomes her friend throughout the film. The son of the Winfields RichardRobert Taylor is immediately smitten by Loretta's beauty initially assuming she is a guest rather than a maid. Soon he's talking marriage but she initially objects that a marriage between a scion of a wealthy family and their maid wouldn't be accepted socially. He nixes this objection and eventually she gives in not telling his parents initially. Meanwhile evil Wroxton finally makes his move proposing marriage. She flatly turns him down. Wroxton spends the remainder of the film trying to get Loretta in trouble with the family or the law. He announces to the parents that one of the staff is going to have a baby of which Richard is the father. Loretta admits such but informs them that they are married. Wroxton's major success relates to an incident in which a broke Loretta hesitantly accepts a ride with an unfamiliar manMonroe Owlsey as Coakleywho supposedly stops to introduce her to his grandmotherMay Beatty as grandma Gammon but it turns out to be an illegal gambling den. Unfortunately the police stage a raid just then and Loretta winds up at the police station with no money. Loretta reluctantly calls Wroxton to take a taxi to the police station and pay her fine. This he does. Thus he finds out about her entrance to the gambling den. When he tells the Winfields about this they demand an annulment of the marriage. Richard is not so demanding at first and refuses to sign the annulment but after talking to Loretta he gives in and signs it. However there has to be a trial. Her lawyer finds Coakley who agrees to tell about his role in her being found in that gambling den. However Wroxton pays Coakley to lie and make it look like Loretta was the sleazy one which seemed to cook her goose. But Loretta's lawyer finds out about the dirty deal between Wroxton and Coakley and tells Richard who promptly socks Wroxton's jaw causing him to fall over backwards over a desk the most satisfying moment in the film! Loretta's lawyer called her to the stand once more and she testified that she was only 17 at the time thus underage to be in such an establishment This sealed Richard's mind to withdraw the annulment request........Besides the police raid there was another episode of pandemonium when a guy who talked like a mobster got fresh with Loretta while she was seated in a nightclub. The big sailor with buck teeth who hardly talked got up and socked this guy. In response his buddies came at the sailor followed by various sailors coming to his defense. Soon everybody was fighting and Loretta's salary was stolen from her purse....... As always Loretta is extraordinarily beautiful with many closeups of her face with those big soulful eyes. Robert Taylor was also in his prime and made a very handsome groom.".

And there's also a fine music score by Louis Silvers! The performances are never less than great and the direction by Roy Del Ruth is always highly commendable. I would regard this entry as his best film. Of course he did have a marvelous cast to work with! And it's true that the first half of the movie is more enjoyable than the last because that's when we're introduced to people like Basil Rathbone's delightfully tyrannical butler to Patsy Kelly's running interference and to Joe Lewis and his idea of the perfect first date  and a blind one at that! In the first half director Del Ruth stages a really wonderful brawl which he caps by a glorious scene in which the GOODY TWOSHOES HEROINE IS ARRESTED IN A BROTHEL! I say again This movie is a product of the moral clampdown? Who's kidding who here!From first to last Peverell Marley's photography is always a joy to behold. Ditto MarkLee Kirk's sets decorated by Thomas Little. And joining the fine performances and the highly commendable direction we must pay tribute to the screenplay concocted by Gene Markey and William Conselman from a story by Cleves Kinkead.".

I would regard this entry as his best film. Of course he did have a marvelous cast to work with! And it's true that the first half of the movie is more enjoyable than the last because that's when we're introduced to people like Basil Rathbone's delightfully tyrannical butler to Patsy Kelly's running interference and to Joe Lewis and his idea of the perfect first date  and a blind one at that! In the first half director Del Ruth stages a really wonderful brawl which he caps by a glorious scene in which the GOODY TWOSHOES HEROINE IS ARRESTED IN A BROTHEL! I say again This movie is a product of the moral clampdown? Who's kidding who here!From first to last Peverell Marley's photography is always a joy to behold. Ditto MarkLee Kirk's sets decorated by Thomas Little. And joining the fine performances and the highly commendable direction we must pay tribute to the screenplay concocted by Gene Markey and William Conselman from a story by Cleves Kinkead.";

Before that one could only see deeply indoctrinated and indoctrinating movies about just communist struggle against Nazibourgeois oppressors. This was the first time audience was actually able to just root for the good guys while not simultaneously being hammered by deep messages and propaganda. And the production crew did go to great lengths to make it happen.There really is not much propaganda if any to be seen. There is hardly a mention of who the good guys belong to. There are no speeches of Tito struggle communism or proletariat. Germans are still bad but you'd expect that in any war movie done by nonGermans.There are however a lot of clichs and silly plots and subplots clumsy extras and stunt men the stuff you'd certainly expect in an action flick. There is also the most important ingredient  action. It's spectacular and there is lots of it. Silly script surprisingly doesn't detract from viewing pleasure and well paced directing really keeps it together.Valter stands the test of time just as well as its American spaghetti peers Dirty Dozen or Kelly's Heroes. Nowadays we are all a bit smarter and nobody is required to watch it with naive reverence. There is a lot of unintentionally funny stuff in there such as various goofs regarding anachronism laughable German strategy as depicted or the spy plot in which every principal character easily fools the other side by wearing stolen uniforms and having an impeccable accent when talking to his enemy. Still even with all that its easy to put disbelief on hold and follow the movie in what it is dead serious about  being spectacular and fun.Spectacle and fun is what Valter Brani Sarajevo achieves and it not only makes for two hours well spent  it makes you wanna spend them again and again.".

Every movie of Krvavac are pretty watchful like Most Bridge or Partisans Escadrille.Beside Zivojinovic acting performance in that movie was very weak one of the worst in that movie. Beside in real life Zivojinovic is opposite from Valter in movie he is some kind of the fake Valter in real life he was in 90s in Milosevic's Chetniks party so real Valter in reality fought Chetniks and those like Zivojinovic because they were on side of the Axis.Also it is wrong to say that country of origin of this movie is Yugoslavia.Yugoslavia don't exist it was a communist union created by six countries and this movie was not financed from Yugoslav budget but by Bosnia Film from Sarajevo and majority owner of that movie house was Bosnia. So owner of that movie is Bosnia not Yugoslavia.It was Bosnian movie and Bosnian director. Also SerboCroatian language don't exist it was artificial language created 1954 in Novi Sad by Serbian and Croatian communists and imposed by them to all others in former Yugoslavia.This movie languages are Bosnian and German!".

Beside in real life Zivojinovic is opposite from Valter in movie he is some kind of the fake Valter in real life he was in 90s in Milosevic's Chetniks party so real Valter in reality fought Chetniks and those like Zivojinovic because they were on side of the Axis.Also it is wrong to say that country of origin of this movie is Yugoslavia.Yugoslavia don't exist it was a communist union created by six countries and this movie was not financed from Yugoslav budget but by Bosnia Film from Sarajevo and majority owner of that movie house was Bosnia. So owner of that movie is Bosnia not Yugoslavia.It was Bosnian movie and Bosnian director. Also SerboCroatian language don't exist it was artificial language created 1954 in Novi Sad by Serbian and Croatian communists and imposed by them to all others in former Yugoslavia.This movie languages are Bosnian and German!";

	schema:reviewBody "Delving deep into the dusty and long abandonded vaults of bcinema in search of lost gems always leaves me with a bittersweet taste. On one hand the discovery of unexpected gems where no one would think them possible is a rewarding experience. On the other hand though it makes one wonder how many of these remarkable lowbudget oddities personal love affairs of directors never quite famous and now all but forgotten have almost forever slipped from memory? In any case what we have here is a little postapocalyptic gem from Poland that is really better than it has any right to. The dystopian near future of OBI OBA finds a group of survivors of the nuclear war that ravaged the Earth inhabiting an underworld concrete bunker and biding their time as they wait for the mysterious Ark an air ship of some kind that will come and save them. The Ark proves to be an elaborate hoax carefully designed to give hope to the malnourished and desperate denizens of the bunker while in the meantime the dome that separates their miserable existence from the nuclear winter outside is slowly caving in.What first striked me about the movie is the design of the bunker and the depiction of the survivors. The survivors are gaunt filthy and terriblelooking penitents dressed in rags and aimlessly wandering the neonlit halls of the bunker like automatons. The bunker is a rundown seedy place with bright neon lights peering from all sides like the eyes of malignant beasts.On one hand it is a slightly 80's depiction of the dystopian future but the movie never stoops down to MAD MAX cheese. Instead it combines biting political satire with the bleak outlook of a world with no future black comedy with barbs on apathy religion and power. The survivors for example are fed some kind of flour dropping from a tube that hovers in the air  later on we discover the food supervisor uses books and the Bible itself as filler for this meagre meal. There are many such short symbolic touches perhaps not lifechanging or faithrestoring yet playful clever and inspired.One thing is for sure OBI OBA is not your runofthemill scifi schlock. It overcomes its modest budget with creativity and has genuine artistic aspirations both from a writing and directing perspective. My opinion is that it should have been filmed in black and white instead of colour though. The director uses atmospheric light and shadow to great effect and it would have registered even better in stark black and white. The bluegreen neon on the other hand outstays its welcome after a while. Just a minor gripe in an otherwise solid bmovie with its heart set in all the right places.Imagine a less bleak THE ROAD Cormac McCarthy being injected with the satire and humour of DR.STRANGELOVE and you're getting there. See it if you can find it.".

As resources grow scarce people become more and more rampant eagerly awaiting the arrival of a fabled Ark which is supposed to save them all. Amidst this mess we find Soft whose job is to check the structural stability of their shelter. When he discovers that the dome is close to collapsing he plunges himself into the pandemonium of the last human civilization in order to find out more about this mythical Ark.I was able to watch a subtitled version of 'OBi OBa  The End of Civilization' at a festival which had a segment dedicated to Eastern European scifi flicks. I didn't know what to expect  none of the actors rang any bells neither did the director. Boy was I in for a surprise! The acting is very solid throughout the movie I especially liked the laconic fatalism of Soft's boss Marek Walczewski and the performances of Jan Nowicki as the Engineer and of Soft himself Jerzy Stuhr who acts as our guide into the depth of the dome and does a wonderful job of trying to keep calm and rationalize his way out of certain doom.What struck me most though is that this movie works perfectly as an postapocalyptic dystopia. It displays the at times pointless struggle of Soft against his and the others' fate while at the same time painting a very dark and cynical portrait of human society living on borrowed time on the brink of certain oblivion. As we follow Soft into the underbelly of the dome's society we discover its secrets layer by layer and realize how paperthin the wall between madness and reason really is. I am not overly familiar with the circumstances in which the movie was made it was shot when Poland was still a Socialist Republic but the social commentary is quite clear. The movie lends itself to be read as criticism of a capitalist society basically and at times quite literally devouring itself. My guess is that it works both ways and can also be applied as an attack on Socialist societal mechanisms as the movie was shot during the last years of collapsing Polish Socialsm but I'd venture on very thin ice if I were to substantialize this claim.At the very least this film revolves around the human condition and contests if the human race has grown in any way over the last centuries and millenia. Great stuff go see it if you have the chance  especially if you're a fan of dystopian fiction!".

	schema:reviewBody "Moving is indeed one of the most moving films about children. It deals with a girl who seems unable to cope with her parents' separation. The movie is very successful in expressing the feelings of the girl and it is not too sweet or sentimental. Though some scenes might lack originality every scene is still extraordinary for me because of its overflowing streams of emotions.Though every scene is excellent there are two scenes which strike me much more strongly than others. One of them is the fireinlaboratory scene. The feelings and emotions expressed in this scene is indescribably strong and remind me of my own childhood.  Another scene which strikes me as severely is the scene when the mother tries to reach her selfconfined daughter. The last 20 minutes of the film are superbly created. It truly reflects the mental state of the girl and though I think this last part expresses something too obviously I still love it because of its strange beauty and its tremendous power. And I think it really offers one of the best solutions to the problem.While the movie mostly shows the traumatic experiences of the girl it also offers a lot of sympathy for other characters. It's really hard to say whose fault it is in this delicate problem. The parents of the child seem to have done the best they can and the child reacts in a much cleverer way than I would do if I were in her place. I really like her lovelybutstronglydetermined ways of protest. The girl who played this miserable child really deserves some performance awards. It is a very difficult task to play a girl who is both strong and fragile and also in deep agony like this.The editing is perfect and gives priority to emotional flows than narrative flows. The cinematography is dazzling especially during the latter part of the film and in the last scene. I feel no surprise to find that  the cinematographer is Toyomichi Kurita who did a wonderful and unforgettable job in The Moderns'.".

I feel no surprise to find that  the cinematographer is Toyomichi Kurita who did a wonderful and unforgettable job in The Moderns'.";

	schema:headline " Unsung masterpiece by a director who died too young spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "The title literally means moving as in moving day or moving out  but more metaphorically refers to moving on.This is an extraordinary film about a 6th grade girl whose family is in the process of falling apart  her parents are in the process of getting divorced. At first a bit oblivious she begins acting out and concocting increasingly desperate stratagems to encourage them to reunite. The film culminates with a forced by the girl family reunion at a fire festival at Lake Biwa where our young heroine runs away from her parents to spend the day and night by herself  first with an elderly local couple who temporarily adopt her then at the ageold nighttime rituals and finally alone with the moon and nature in the hills above the lake and then on its nowdeserted shore.Tomoko Tabata the young girl who plays the film's heroine turns in a remarkable performance. Her parents are presented credibly as ordinary wellmeaning but fallible people. The cinematography by Toyomichi Kurita who has also worked with Oshima and Altman is absolutely superb. The direction by Snji Somai is masterful. Alas Somai died in 2001 in his early 50s just as he was beginning to receive worldwide acclaim.In many ways this film strikes me as a liveaction counterpart to the animated work of Studio Ghibli with its blend of honestly portrayed everyday life with almost a child's eye view and fantasy or seeming fantasy. The links are closest to Isao Takahata's 1991 masterpiece Only Yesterday and there seem to be a few quite overt homages. This film treasure is available on a virtually flawless DVD from Japan accompanied by an interview with a now just barely grownup Tomoko Tabata. Regrettably there are no subtitles on the DVD  and I have not yet found any online subtitle translations. An English subtitled version does did exist as this was shown at various international festivals when it was new  but it does not seem to have ever gained US distribution. Pray for a festival appearance near you andor a subtitled DVD release  or start learning Japanese.".

	schema:reviewBody "Timing can perhaps have a big impact on the international success of a career. As the 1990s progressed Japanese cinema grew in popularity around the world once more starting to win major awards as in the days of the old masters. The 1970s and 1980s however were a little slower  in terms of international acclaim anyway  for Japanese directors. And while there were some great films made during this period it is perhaps something of a lost generation for Japanese cinema. Most of the films of Shinji' Somai's twenty year career from 1980 2000 were made during the 1980s with the end of his career coming as many Japanese directors saw theirs take off. Domestic success therefore did not result in international in perhaps a reverse of the approach to the new millennium where many Japanese were less aware ofexcited by the films of Kitano Takeshi and Miike Takashi as some in the West. My first exposure to Somai's work was 2000's Kazahana his last film and while good perhaps not a fair reflection of the body of his work. But with releases less easy to locate in the West the Internet can be a place to try and unearth some of his treasures. Ohikkoshi Moving one of Somai's later films shows a strong director using quite simple ideas to powerful effect.Renko Urushiba is a girl about 12 years old whose parents are to separate. A seemingly normal family dinner between the three does not seem to reflect the discussion between her parents Kenichi and Nazuna that Kenichi will be moving out tomorrow. Aware of this fact Renko carries on as normal happygolucky not fully understanding what the situation really means. Gradually Renko's world becomes torn between her mother  applying strict rules while trying to be her best friend  and her father  with a more laidback indifference and between friendship circles at school with newfound empathy with some of the school's outcasts betraying her family's supposed normality. Despite her attempts at trying to patch the family back together the more she tries the more she feels that she is alone the Urushiba's now three individuals rather than a family unit. This results in her running away when trying to recreate a family holiday from the past instead taking a voyage of discovery on her own. Now this all sounds pretty usual comingofage stuff as a child struggles to come to terms with elements of life they will have to get used to as they grow older learning that fairy tales do not exist and life will not always be how you want it. But rather than choosing to focus too much on sentimentality Somai puts the audience in the role of the child. The cause of the breakup is never fully explained throughout the film keeping the audience in the child's perspective of ignorance of the adult actions that impact on their lives. Increasingly Renko comes to terms with the fact that she is on her own neither of her parents willing to help her understand further. It's for this reason that she chooses to run away when the pair still show animosity towards each other when she slyly organises a family reunion for the fireworks festival at Biwako. Her running away allows both Kenichi and Nazuna to better understand their own failings in the family Kenichi chooses against taking a customary swig from his hipflask and Nazuna admitting that perhaps she may be just as much to blame for the relationship failing. But it is now too late. Spending the night alone in the woods by the lake Renko wonders alone until she comes to the shore spying a boat from the festival covered in fireworks. In a dreamlike sequence she watches on as the family happily play together in the water during a summer of yesteryear. But soon her parents turn their backs on her and walk away into the water before sinking below leaving her asking where are you going? Receiving no answer she is left alone. But it is the Renko of the past that disappears the Renko of today watching on shouting Omedetou gozaimasu at the festival boat in congratulations her transformation complete. The closing credits are accompanied by a vibrant gleeful Renko dancing around a street scene touching everyone she meets gifting a flower to her mother suppressing her father's wine glass as she massages his shoulders claiming she is moving to the future. The future is a clearly older Renko in a school uniform a more assertive and serious expression painted on her face. Renko has matured though whether this is for the better is left open. This simple but powerful style of filmmaking is clear to see influencing the likes of directors such as Hirokazu Koreeda Miwa Nishikawa Kiyoshi Kurosawa in Tokyo Sonata and other regulars on international film festival circuits. Somai missed out on this year onyear international success of those that came after him. But much like Renko's acceptance of her situation his influence perhaps has a longer more lasting impression rather than an instant hit. politic1983.blogspot.co.uk".

	schema:reviewBody "'Radio' tells the true life story of a high school football coach who befriends a severely mentally retarded young man whom they nickname 'Radio' because he loves listening to the radio so much lets him hang out with the team and thereby changes not only the boy's life but the lives of just about everyone in the South Carolina town in which they live. When Radio's behavior on the sidelines begins to serve as a distraction during the games some of the less sympathetic diehard football fans of the town make an effort to downplay his role or eliminate his presence altogether.Set in 1976 'Radio' is a thoroughly predictable sentimental heart tugger that will have people either gagging on the syrup or crying in their popcorn. For all its heavy handed manipulation however 'Radio' turns out to be a pretty decent little film due primarily to the superb performances by Ed Harris and Cube Gooding Jr. and to the fact that the movie doesn't overplay its hand as often as it might. In fact it wisely underplays much of the conflict allowing the moments of quiet subtlety to predominate. As played by Harris Coach Jones is a solid decent caring man who can't help but give his love to a fellow human being who needs it. Harris' softspoken strength makes us believe in the goodness of the man. The film does an effective job conveying the incredulous reactions of many of the otherwise wellmeaning town folk as even Radio's own mother asks Joe why he is doing what he's doing. The scenes between Jones and this woman lovingly played by S. Epatha Merkerson are some of the finest in the film. The movie also isn't afraid to confront the issue of whether the people of the town  and that includes Jones himself  aren't actually being patronizing towards Radio in their treatment of him and whether he isn't more of a 'mascot' for the team than a bona fide member. Gooding Jr. slips effortlessly into the role of Radio making him a compelling figure even though he has virtually no lines of dialogue in the movie. Alfre Woodard is excellent as the caring but nervous school principal who sees Radio's presence on campus as a potential threat to student safety but who has enough faith in Jones to give Radio a chance to prove himself. It's nice to see Debra Winger in a movie again although her role as Jones' everpatient eversupportive wife doesn't give her much room to strut her stuff as an actress. There's no denying that 'Radio' is a humanityofman type film that could easily set the teeth on edge with its Goody Two Shoes philosophy of life. Be that as it may 'Radio' turns out to be a warm uplifting film that even Scrooge would probably like.".

The story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from figuring the ending out. In one moment you think that something happens to Coach Jones or Radio. Well it does but certainly not what you'd expect.The film becomes at no point boring or too sentimental and the acting performances by Ed Harris  Cuba Gooding Jr. are some of their best in my opinion. The ending puts a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right. Well I guess that was what Michael Tollin  Mike Rich were trying to do.

The story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from figuring the ending out. In one moment you think that something happens to Coach Jones or Radio. Well it does but certainly not what you'd expect.The film becomes at no point boring or too sentimental and the acting performances by Ed Harris  Cuba Gooding Jr. are some of their best in my opinion. The ending puts a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right. Well I guess that was what Michael Tollin  Mike Rich were trying to do.

I adore Ed Harris so watching him and Cuba act alongside each other was a treat to watch. Radio I suppose is a predictable piece of sentimentality but the way it's done is wonderful. I have worked with people who are mentally challenged and ever since then I have grown to understand and deal with them with patience so while I was watching the story unfold I couldn't help but feel emotion for Radio. I really don't understand how Cuba Gooding earned a razzy for his performance here I felt it was Oscar worthy!. I really feel Radio is a nice feelgood story of a kid that's mentally challenged being accepted by the society that he is living in and becoming a legend in his own right. Maybe people won't love it as much as I did but if you've worked with these kinds of kids perhaps you'd understand why I got into this as much as I did.Performances. Cuba Gooding gives yet again a fantastic performance. This should have revived his career but instead he's doing many crappy DTV movies now which is very sad with a man of his caliber of talent. He feels mentally challenged looks mentally challenged it really was a phenomenal performance. Ed Harris is just as good. His character isn't as hard to play but he has a lot of heart and his character was just as important.Bottom line. Radio is a great piece of sentimentality and it's bound to jerk a few tears or two see it.910".

The answer appears to be that in spite of his handicap James Kennedy understood much more than what he was given credit for and went to become a fixture in the sports scene. Also the film is saying how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if only we have the patience Coach Jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart.Radio directed by Michael Tolllin is a formula film inspired on a true story. Yet the movie is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances the director was able to get from his wonderful cast.Coach Jones is instrumental in getting the young man who is called Radio because his passion for collecting them involved in sports a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has had only hard knocks in his young life. Coming from a poor background Radio lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the coach's intentions. Radio is seen by the school kids as a mascot at first then his sunny disposition wins him the acceptance of everyone because he is a good person without an ounce of malice in his body.The film owes a lot to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. who make a great pair as the coach and Radio. Mr. Harris one of the best actors of our times is never boring in anything he graces with his presence. He gets the essence of the principled coach who sees the possibility to make amends for something that bothers him from his past. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man.The supporting cast is excellent. S. Ephata Merkerson one of the best actresses of her generation does interesting work as the mother of Radio. Alfre Woodard another good actress plays the high school principle with style. Debra Winger only has a few scenes in the film.Radio while being sentimental will warm anyone's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people are in our society that we know nothing about and how quick we are to judge them. Michael Tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us.".

I think they went a little overboard on his character but that's better than the reverse showing him worse than what he was in real life. Odd to see Harris playing the role too since he has a long resume of playing nasty profane characters.Anyway I never complain about a nice feelgood film and it is nice to see a bunch of well meaning kind people. Those folks direct their friendship love and compassion to James Kennedy better known as Radio a mentally slow high school kid played by Cuba Gooding Jr. The story takes place in the mid 1970s in South Carolina. Gooding does a nice job with the role too. However like Sean Penn's role of a mentallychallenged man in I Am Sam an hourandahalf of a character like this is plenty. After that the loudness of those guys gets tiresome to hear.Note It was interesting in one of the documentaries on this DVD to find out that in real life in took years for Radio to make his transformation not months as shown in the film.".

I never really got Steinbeck's message.You see all this time I thought his book and the movie were about LOVE . . . and love which is so damn important whether in all caps or in lower case is still such a small and unimportant emotion compared to human dignity. That's the story of Radio and that's the story Of Mice and Men. And yes talking about OMM I did cry in the final scene when big Lennie so pathetically says Tell me about the rabbits George. But until I saw the movie Radio even though I never would even think of doing a cruel thing to retarded individuals . . . I never really got Steinbeck's message and I never really understood about human dignity. I like the fact that Radio learned slowly but that the town and the townspeople learned rapidly from him. And the one line where it's said  . . . he treats ALL of us ALL the time like we wish people treated us half the time . . . Radio was absolutely nothing like I expected and everything the best movies are.".

Ed Harris is great as Harold Jones but this actor IS great so this is not anything new.The mentally challenged young man called James Robert Kennedy always walk around the T.L.

One day when the football's ball is throw near him he decides to stay with the ball for the impatience of Johnny Cash one of the best players from the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you would ever met. One day Cash decides to punish James mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up.When coach Jones discovers that horrible act he stays angry and punish all the team deciding for this day on to help James who gets the nickname 'Radio' because of his passion for radios in general.The movie shows how Radio becomes an adept assistant helping the team train despite hardships from the players and even getting respect from basically all the people who lives in the small city. I would recommend this movie for everybody who wants to watch a real and beautiful story. It has a life lessonspecially showing us how a person can make a difference even not being what we call ''normal''.

	schema:headline " Great Performances In A Well Done FactBased Film";
	schema:reviewBody "The highlights of this film are the two absolutely superb performances by Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris. Gooding was the title character  James Robert Kennedy a mentally disabled young man known simply as Radio because of his love for radios. Harris played Harold Jones  a local high school teacher who was also coach of the Hanna High School football team and the school's athletic director. The movie is the portrayal of how their relationship develops with Jones taking the young man under his wing so to speak and making him part of both the team and the school community fighting the efforts of many of the townsfolk and school board officials to have him removed.It's certainly a heartwarming story although it's not exactly what I'd call a tearjerker although there are moments when tears might flow particularly the death of Radio's mother. There are question raised throughout the movie that are often hard to deal with. One admires Jones' devotion to Radio but one wonders why he seems unable to show the same devotion to his own daughter. It's great to see Radio becoming gradually accepted as part of the team and school but the movie doesn't shy away from the question of whether he isn't being treated more as a mascot than anything else  certainly a question that ran through my head on a number of occasions as we watch Radio lead the team on the the field and join the cheerleading squad from time to time. Jones' own personal motivation is finally explained as he relates a childhood experience to his daughter that illustrates why he feels so strongly for Radio. In the end Radio's place within the life of the school is made more official and Kennedy is apparently still roaming the halls and the sidelines of Hanna High as an official 11th Grade student for as long as he wants to be one  this being based on a true story.Based on a true story always makes me wonder. Kennedy is real and he's really at Hanna High and he and Jones are really friends so there's obviously a strong basis in fact for this movie. I wondered though about what seemed to be the surprisingly easy acceptance of Radio among the townspeople. Although the whole community was concerned about the onfield performance of the football team aside from one parent and one school board official people seemed largely unconcerned about or uninterested in Radio himself  which struck me as a surprisingly bland reaction for a small southern town in the late 1960's to have for a mentally disabled young black man. But clearly it worked long term. I did appreciate that this was about much more than the football team. The football team was the backdrop for what happened but no more than that. This was't an underdog overcomes sports story. The Hanna High team didn't have a great season in this movie neither Radio nor Coach Jones inspired them to win anything of significance. The football team just became in some ways a microcosm of the community as they grew more and more accepting of Radio to the point at which Radio's presence was simply a given.This is a very well done film one of the better based on a true story films I've come across. 810".

Because this is not a movie this is a story that really happened and to say this is film is poor bad taste or anything below the belt lowers your soul to a standard that should not be even thought of.This movie touched my heart and I'm sure it touched yours.......Well at least those with sense.";

	schema:headline " I hate this film";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay this review is for everyone who complained that I only wrote 1010 reviews. First off the background. I like to give people the background of what I thought of the film before I saw it so they know where I'm coming from. So...I've not EVER been a fan of this film. I saw the trailer and said to myself 'Wow another 'inspired by a true story Remember the Titansesque 'uplifting' film only now we've got Cuba 'I'm an Academy Award winnner yet I did 'Snow Dogs' Gooding Jr. as a retarded kid. Whoopdifriggingdo.' My fears stayed unabated especially when reviews popped up on AICN such as one proclaiming that the reviewer would rather razor blade his gums than see the film again. So I had decided to skip 'Radio' and just not ever bother with it. I saw RtT as well as 'The Rookie' which by the way was written by the same guy who wrote this and found them not too bad and I actually LIKED 'Rookie' but the concept to this one just seemed TOO dumb to bother with.However turns out that this story happened in Anderson South Carolina which happens to be my Dad's home town. In fact if you watch the film they talk about 'West Side' and there's even a game against this 'West Side' and that school turns out to be the one my father went to. He was even attending West Side in 1976 which is the time that the story took place not the actual event mind you that happened in the early 60s. My Dad even worked at the only Burger King in town so when the assistant goes out for burgers from said chain he very well may have gotten they served to him by my Dad. So a lot of connections. My interest was piqued a TEENY bit but definatly not enough to spend seven dollars on.Which brings us to Saturday. 'Oh we're going to a movie this afternoon' my mom says. 'Which one?' I ask begging that they want to take me to 'Lost in Translation' or even better 'Thirteen.' 'We're gonna see 'Radio.'' I inwardly and outwardly groaned. 'Isn't there anything better out?' Yes there is. 'No and plus it takes place in Anderson.' 'You're paying for it?' 'Yes.' 'Alright then.' So once I get off work I trundle down to the local multiplex not excited at ALL about seeing the film but actually excited about reviewing the film later.So...to what you've all been waiting for the actual review.THE ACTINGI'm going to put off talking about Cuba for a moment to talk about everyone else. AHH!!! Gah! Dangnabit people! Alright Ed Harris whom I LOVED in 'The Truman Show' did an OKAY job in his part as the coach but EVERYONE ELSE WAS TERRIBLE. Part of it was the lines given to them i.e. 'All along we thought we were teaching Radio but it turns out Radio was teaching us' but the other part is that the people were just NOT good actors. From the WB wannabes playing the football players to even the so I hear living legend Debra Winger was terrible. Off off OFF line readings. I've seen better line reading by ME for crying out loud. Note to actors if I can act better than you then you don't deserve to be on the big screen.Now on to good old Cuba Gooding Junior. Now I like this guy I really do. He was great in 'Jerry Maguire' 'Pearl Harbor' and even 'Men of Honor.' Then he decided to go do 'Snow Dogs' 'Boat Trip' and 'The Fighting Temptations.' UGH. I guess he decided he needed to do and acting film to make up for his tresspasses against the silver screen. But lemme tell you something Cuba this is NOT the role for you. First off you are TOO DAMN OLD! The guy is going on 36 and he's playing a role where he's supposed to be in his twenties! The age is showing man. I had no idea how old the guy was supposed to be until they finally told us because he looks like an old guy already and I knew the character wasn't supposed to be that old. Okay he did an okay job of doing the mentally retarded thing. Not Oscar worthy no where NEAR what Tom Hanks in 'Forrest Gump' or even Sean Penn in 'i am sam' were able to pull off. He's just a comical 'retarded kid.' I couldn't feel sorry for him because I kept being told I shouldn't and I couldn't feel happy for him because he's MENTALLY RETARDED! The movie didn't try to show HOW being mentally retarded is a good thing...but I'm getting off topic.Just know that everyone sucked except for Cuba who was good but not great.ACTING SCORE 410THE WRITING'Radio's got a good heart.' 'All along Radio's been the one teaching us.' GIVE ME A FRIGGING BREAK! The key to a good movie is that you don't tell us everything! And this film TOLD US EVERYTHING! And on top of it it didn't let us SEE everything!The whole premise I think it was very unclear was that through something Radio was able to inspire a football team or a town or something. He did not do this. The things we see him do are in no particular order1. Go in a girl's locker room and then be sad about it 2. Get a penatly called on the team for shouting 'chickingshitchickingshitchickenshit!' at the coach which was not as funny as you might think it would be 3. Cause a whole bunch of ruckas at the school with the school board investigating 4. Listen to a radio 5. Tear up his room 6. Talk funny 7. Give out presents for no particular reasonThe things this resulted in1. The coach left the team and they didn't win a championship 2. We find out that the coach is going to start paying closer attention to his familyYes that's it. No OVERCOMING RASCISM no INSPIRING THE TEAM TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP no REALISING THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE WERE RETARDED none of that stuff we've come to expect from this type of film. NOTHING HAPPENED! NOTHING! I left the theatre not sure why I bothered in the first place. All we did was watch some semiinteresting events that happened and see a coach get reunited to his family which wasn't even shown well.Overall it felt like they wanted to make a movie about Radio but didn't have a real point to it all so just gave us some things to look at and a couple of events to make the woman cry. Pathetic.WRITING SCORE 110 with extreme prejudiceTHE DIRECTINGMichael Tollin shows us that he did in fact pass 'How to direct a movie TYPICALLY 101' with flying colours. HE does nothing new he does nothing bold. He directs the film like any other director would have done it only he's latched on to the recent 'zoom at random moments in sports events' trend and figured out like everyone else that sports are more exciting when the camera in on the field instead of on the sidelines. Wooo.I guess I shouldn't have expected anything astounding but I sure didn't get it anyway. The film felt like it was shot by a group of ADs.DIRECTING SCORE 310OVERALLI hated this film. I'll just go out and say it the only redeeming factor in this film was Sarah Drew who was the voice of 'Sarah Rowe' in the CLASSIC Mtv animated series 'Daria' which I'm afraid far too many people have forgotten. She was hot. The rest of the film...was not.However If you areA. An adultandB. You have no taste in filmThen you will LOVE this film. I know this because I heard everyone raving about how good it was and how sad it was and how uplifting it was and how good Cuba Gooding Jr. was...everything the studio execs wanted them to think. They obviously were not paying any attention to what the film actually WAS they made up their minds the second they saw Cuba going down that hill in the shopping cart. Which once again was nowhere near as touching as they meant it to be.But if you are in those categories then you will love the film. Chris' Mom and Dad and speaking to you   The rest of you aviod this film like the Plague.OVERALL SCORE 310".

The atmosphere of an upperclass Muslim home is captured very well and the performances of Mala Sinha and Nirupa as young mothers of different faiths are good. While Shashi Kapoor as the illegitimate Muslim son adopted into the Hindu family is okay it's also fascinating to see Rajindra Kumar in a minor role as and even more fanatic Hindu. There's little suspense in the story the only question really is if Shashi will live or die after he finds out he was born a Muslim but the first half and the message of communal harmony are handled quite well. It's certainly a Yash Chopra film social issues disguised in a romance and still effective today.".

Often I leave a movie thinking I've enjoyed it and never give it a second thought. I wasn't sure for a lot of the film exactly what the point is other than the relationship between Peck An outlaw with Scottish descendancy and Billy A halfbreed Native Indian. But actually this is the point and the characters are what make this movie work. Gregory Peck could never be accused of being type cast and he gave a valiant attempt at pulling off a Scottish accent. A lot of the words he nailed but then the accent completely disappeared for run of the mill dialect. A little more direction and time and his language would have matched an otherwise strong performance. Billy seemed a straightforward character to start with but layer upon layer are revealed as the movie progresses including an explanation for an otherwise daft movie title and you really find a sense of his history and upbringing. The sheriff gave a worthy performance but I was particularly impressed with the Apache gang and the stuttering wife. The Apache were made all the more terrifying by their random nature and personality so far removed from stereotypical Apache. The guy with the white parasol was the best of the bunch. The parasol is mentioned but no reference is made to how he obtained this. Some things are best unsaid had he massacred a previous wagon and removed this as a trophy from some poor unsuspecting traveller? The stuttering wife was beautifully played. Her husband's answer to this disability was to slap her round the face. To her and her guests this was nothing more than abuse but the husband clearly thought he was 'Rattling her brain box' and helping her out. Her vulnerability loneliness and desire for love were superbly portrayed and I wish her love for Billy had been explored more fully. The movie reached a standoff climax and there is a moral about how we treat our dead at the end which again leaves you thinking. Give this movie a chance you may well draw a different conclusion but it is a little gem worth giving a chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very different type of western film although the main premise of the story sounds very routine. One has to wonder why it was filmed over in the Middle East instead of a closer location here in America. If anyone finds out please let me know. This story is about a bank robber named Arch Deans Gregory Peck who has an accomplice that is half Indian named Billy Desi Arnaz Jr. and Billy has been captured by Sheriff Henry Gifford Jack Warden who plans on taking him back to be hanged even though it was Arch who killed someone during the holdup. Arch sneaks up on Henry one morning and shoots him in the shoulder to wound him. He and Billy ride off to Mexico but they are unaware that Henry's friend Copeland David Huddleston has a buffalo rifle and he uses it to shoot Arch's horse that collapses and breaks Arch's leg. SPOILER ALERTBecause of his shoulder it takes a day or two before Henry can ride and this gives Arch and Billy a head start but with his broken leg they are slowed down as well. They come across a home owned by a man named Spencer John Pearce who is abusive to his stuttering wife Esther Sian Barbara Allen and Arch tells him he'll pay him 100 dollars for a ride in his wagon. Spencer agrees and Billy is told to stay with Esther until her husband comes back. While on the road Arch and Spencer are ambushed by Indians and Spencer gets killed while Arch is mortally wounded. Meanwhile Billy and Esther get very friendly and sleep together until Henry comes barging in and handcuffs him to take him back for his hanging. This film was directed by Ted Kotcheff who is a very good and capable director in both film and television. Somehow this film ended up in Israel to be made and even though you can say all deserts look the same the truth is that it does look a bit off and different. Some of the clues that it's not America is that there are no cactus to be found and whatever vegetation that is seen is definitely not from our region. The lack of other actors and extras in small roles also is missing and the whole film has a very remote and distant feel to it. This isn't meant as criticism but the mood and tone of the film is not like any other western I have seen. Peck seems to be genuinely having fun in his role and it's probably because he's getting a rare opportunity to play a character that can be described as a cad and a rogue. Arnaz doesn't have to do much since his character is suppose to remain relatively stoic. Warden is well cast as the hard and tough racist sheriff but for me the best performance in the film comes from Allen as the lonely wife. We understand her loneliness completely and Allen shows some real despair in her beautiful brown eyes. Even for a western this film moves along very slowly and there are several gaps where Peck and Arnaz are separated. This is definitely a different film for the genre but I found the uniqueness compelling for some reason. I am recommending it although if your tempted to view it just be reminded that this is definitely a curio.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a very different type of western film although the main premise of the story sounds very routine. One has to wonder why it was filmed over in the Middle East instead of a closer location here in America. If anyone finds out please let me know. This story is about a bank robber named Arch Deans Gregory Peck who has an accomplice that is half Indian named Billy Desi Arnaz Jr. and Billy has been captured by Sheriff Henry Gifford Jack Warden who plans on taking him back to be hanged even though it was Arch who killed someone during the holdup. Arch sneaks up on Henry one morning and shoots him in the shoulder to wound him. He and Billy ride off to Mexico but they are unaware that Henry's friend Copeland David Huddleston has a buffalo rifle and he uses it to shoot Arch's horse that collapses and breaks Arch's leg. SPOILER ALERTBecause of his shoulder it takes a day or two before Henry can ride and this gives Arch and Billy a head start but with his broken leg they are slowed down as well. They come across a home owned by a man named Spencer John Pearce who is abusive to his stuttering wife Esther Sian Barbara Allen and Arch tells him he'll pay him 100 dollars for a ride in his wagon. Spencer agrees and Billy is told to stay with Esther until her husband comes back. While on the road Arch and Spencer are ambushed by Indians and Spencer gets killed while Arch is mortally wounded.

There are still nice scenes to watch such as the final images when Gregory Peck is besieged below a cart by Indian warriors that hold a remarkable resemblance to Burt Lancaster surrounded in 'The Ulzana's raid 1972' by Robert Aldrich. The actors supporting the lead roles are very fine as Jack Weston  David Huddleston and Barbara Allen playing a stuttering young wife. However  the cinematography filmed in Israel is lousy and in faded colors for that reason is urgent a necessary remastering. Atmospheric and rare musical score  including some of guitar sounds by John Scott. This first Western shot in Israel is professionally directed by Ted Kotcheff and skillfully written by Alan Sharp. Kotcheff got great success on action cinema  First blood Uncommon valor The shooter  and comedy Switching channels Fun with Dick and Jane .

I wonder just how much danger Greg and the cast were in.The title role is played by Desi Arnaz Jr. and Gregory Peck plays a Scottish outlaw from the old west. A pair of amiable bankrobbers Arnaz prevents Peck from being captured by Marshal Jack Warden. Of course Arnaz is caught but later Peck rescues him at the cost of a broken leg. Actually the most interesting part in the film is that of Jack Warden as the Marshal. He may have the badge but he's not exactly Wyatt Earp as the Wyatt Earp legend has him. In fact Gene Hackman may very well have studied this film for his portrayal of a nasty town marshal in Clint Eastwood's The Unforgiven.I wouldn't recommend this film for anyone other than fans of Gregory Peck.".

This is a very good Western it has some great powerful performances from Peck and Arnaz Jr who was truly very watchable and conveyed a lot of underlying emotions. The movie concerns the relationship between diverse characters Peck's humorous kind portrayal of a man who has turned to crime to ensure a living to Arnaz's contained portrayal of a man caught between two worlds perhaps his two hats nomenclature is a euphemism for the two worlds he straddles. The supporting characters are no less interesting with Jack Warden as the relentless sheriff who doesn't understand the relationship between the two and David Huddlestones Store owner who was a buffalo hunter sharpshooter in the recent past and who can see the new future promised by the railroad and the advent of civilization to come. The move itself is quite metaphorical and symbolic but doesn't lose sight of the main thread that of the growth of Billy Two Hats in the company of his wise mentor. I really enjoyed it and I hope you will too. The only downside was Gregory Peck's dreadful Scottish accent which appears and disappears randomly throughout.".

The plot is extremely simple and the only other factor that comes into play is that Arnaz plays a halfIndianand the Sheriff is sure confused as to why anyone would risk their life to save one of them.I read a few reviews that complained about Peck's accent. I honestly couldn't say whether it was good or notit sounded fine to me but I certainly am no experteven if I have been to Scotland a couple times! I am sure someone from the UK would easily detect any defects with such an accent! However what I could tell easily was that the story was very very slow and starkand this was heightened by the lack of a musical score. In fact the only reason I kept with the story was because it had Gregory Peck. All in all a fair movie but that's about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you weren't there then unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you. Which as I say is a shame because although some of the acting is amateurish it is meant to be for realism. Let's face itin real life we don't say things in an exacting or perfect way even when we mean to. In this sense it works. This however does not apply to our known actors in this film notably Jodie Foster born a natural. The fact that the other 3 girls are not accomplished only adds to the storyJodie plays the glue that struggles to keep their friendship close even with the obvious feeling of fatality. Meaning that no matter how close friends are eventually there are some people that just fade away no matter how you try.And therein is the core of the movie. It's not about partying it's not about sexuality but about these 4 girls and their final time as still young girls before they have to go the world alone.If you have ever had a friendship like that in your life you will feel this movieit will mean a lot to you no matter what era it is set in or what era you grew up in. We all knew these girls in school or at the very least knew of them. We all knew the frustrated virgin half wanting to hold onto childhood and half wanting desperately to grow up and thinking that will do it for her. We all knew the boycrazy one the fashion plate whose vanity hides her fear of the world her fear of acceptance. We all knew the party girl the one they whispered about with tales of not only her sad home life but of her notorious exploits. And we all knew the mother figure the one a little more real a little more grounded a little more sad because she knew what would happen. Maybe you were one of those girls.

	onyx:emotionText "If you weren't there then unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you. Which as I say is a shame because although some of the acting is amateurish it is meant to be for realism. Let's face itin real life we don't say things in an exacting or perfect way even when we mean to. In this sense it works. This however does not apply to our known actors in this film notably Jodie Foster born a natural. The fact that the other 3 girls are not accomplished only adds to the storyJodie plays the glue that struggles to keep their friendship close even with the obvious feeling of fatality. Meaning that no matter how close friends are eventually there are some people that just fade away no matter how you try.And therein is the core of the movie. It's not about partying it's not about sexuality but about these 4 girls and their final time as still young girls before they have to go the world alone.If you have ever had a friendship like that in your life you will feel this movieit will mean a lot to you no matter what era it is set in or what era you grew up in. We all knew these girls in school or at the very least knew of them. We all knew the frustrated virgin half wanting to hold onto childhood and half wanting desperately to grow up and thinking that will do it for her. We all knew the boycrazy one the fashion plate whose vanity hides her fear of the world her fear of acceptance. We all knew the party girl the one they whispered about with tales of not only her sad home life but of her notorious exploits. And we all knew the mother figure the one a little more real a little more grounded a little more sad because she knew what would happen. Maybe you were one of those girls. Maybe like me you had been each one at one time or another...This film really captures that fragile time in life when want needs pressures womanhood childhood the world and loneliness are all embodied in each female's head each factor on the precipice.

The whole movie seems realistic and is very interesting and thoughtful. It concerns four teenage girls struggling with problems as they live their lives in the San Fernando Valley. Jeanie Foster is fighting with her divorced mother Annie Currie is a teen runaway who drinks and pops pills and runs away from her abusive father. Madge Kagan is a young girl who is overweight and mad that she is a virgin. Plus her parents are overprotective and she has annoying younger siblings. Then there is Deirdre Stroh who is not as developed as the other characters she is basically one of their friends who likes boys and has a lot of boy troubles. I like the music the acting and there were some scenes that were great...the party and the ending were standout scenes. The concert scenes were funny as well. The ending is a tearjerker but I won't give it away. See for yourself and rent or buy this great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jodie Foster Cherie Currie the former lead singer of the seminal allgirl rock group the Runaways in her remarkably able acting debut Marilyn Kagan and Kandice Stroh are uniformly believable splendid and touching as the titular quartet who are a tightknit clique of troubled fiercely loyal adolescent girls with negligent uncaring selfabsorbed parents who do their best to grow up and fend for themselves in the affluent San Fernando Valley California suburbs. The girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex drugs alcohol commitment and so on at a tender young age when they're not fully prepared to completely own up to the potentially harmful consequences of said decisions. Foster giving one of her most perceptive affecting and underrated performances to date is basically the group's den mother who presides over the wellbeing of both herself and the others she's especially concerned about the goodhearted but reckless and selfdestructive Currie whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely end.This picture offers a poignant insightful often devastatingly credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of broken dysfunctional families which exist directly underneath suburbia's neatly manicured surface and the tragic net result of such families tough resilient but unhappy and vulnerable kids who have to confront the trials and tribulations of growing up on their own because their parents are either too inconsiderate or even nonexistent. Adrian Fatal Attraction Jacob's Ladder Lyne's direction is both sturdy and observant while Gerald Ayres' script is somewhat messy and rambling but overall still accurate in its frank gritty unsentimental depiction of your average latchkey kid's nervewrackingly chaotic capricious and unpredictable everyday life. Leon Bijou's soft dewy almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence. Giorgio Moroder arranged the excellent score which makes particularly effective use of Donna Summer's elegiac On the Radio. The topnotch cast includes Sally Kellerman as Foster's neurotic insecure peevish mother Scott Baio as a sweet skateboarder dude Randy Quaid as Kagan's rich older boyfriend British 60's pop singer Adam Faith as Foster's feckless absentee rock promoter father and Lois Smith as Kagan's smothering overprotective mother. Appearing in brief bits are Robert Romanus Mike Damone Fast Times at Richmont High as one of Foster's morose exboyfriends and a gawky braceswearing Laura Dern as an obnoxious party crasher. Achingly authentic engrossing and deeply moving Currie's grim ultimate fate is very heartbreaking Foxes is quite simply one of the most unsung and underappreciated teen movies made about early 80's adolescence.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion its thought provoking funny and sad with amazing performances all around!. All the characters are wonderful and the story is just brilliant! plus Jodie Foster and Cherie Currie are simply amazing in this!. The Ending is very powerful however I won't spoil it for you and I thought the character development was top notch! plus you can really relate to all of the characters especially Jeanie and Annie as you will be rooting for them! plus I loved how it moved slowly and giving you a chance to get to know all the characters and what there about. I can't believe this only has a 5.9 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion and it was funny seeing Randy Quaid in this type of role plus this is extremely well written and made as well!. One scene that really got to me was when MadgeMarilyn Kagan is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party and the film has many surprising moments as well! plus the dialog is especially excellent. This is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time In my opinion its thought provoking funny and sad with amazing performances all around and i say Go see it immediately! your bound to love it!. The Direction is fantastic!. Adrian Lyne does a fantastic job here with awesome camera work and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace!. The Acting is amazing!. Jodie Foster is really cute and is amazing as always! she was extremely likable caring had a lovable character was intense in some scenes was focused and she and Cherie Currie were the heart of the film as Jeanie and Annie!Foster Rules!!!!!!!. Cherie Currie is way hot and is amazing here i really felt sorry for her character as she had a very likable character that just needed help she gives a powerful performance and created a very memorable character she was amazing!. Scott Baio is great as Brad he was really likable and did his job well i liked him. Randy Quaid is great in his serious role surprisingly i liked him. Sally Kellerman is great as the mother i liked her a lot. Marilyn Kagan and Kandice Stroh are both very good as Madge and Deirdre and did what they had to do well as the other two friends. Laura Dern has a very early role here as it was cool to see her not much of a part though. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall go see it immediately it's an underrated masterpiece!.  out of 5".

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion its thought provoking funny and sad with amazing performances all around!. All the characters are wonderful and the story is just brilliant! plus Jodie Foster and Cherie Currie are simply amazing in this!. The Ending is very powerful however I won't spoil it for you and I thought the character development was top notch! plus you can really relate to all of the characters especially Jeanie and Annie as you will be rooting for them! plus I loved how it moved slowly and giving you a chance to get to know all the characters and what there about. I can't believe this only has a 5.9 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion and it was funny seeing Randy Quaid in this type of role plus this is extremely well written and made as well!. One scene that really got to me was when MadgeMarilyn Kagan is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party and the film has many surprising moments as well! plus the dialog is especially excellent. This is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time In my opinion its thought provoking funny and sad with amazing performances all around and i say Go see it immediately! your bound to love it!. The Direction is fantastic!. Adrian Lyne does a fantastic job here with awesome camera work and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace!. The Acting is amazing!. Jodie Foster is really cute and is amazing as always! she was extremely likable caring had a lovable character was intense in some scenes was focused and she and Cherie Currie were the heart of the film as Jeanie and Annie!Foster Rules!!!!!!!. Cherie Currie is way hot and is amazing here i really felt sorry for her character as she had a very likable character that just needed help she gives a powerful performance and created a very memorable character she was amazing!. Scott Baio is great as Brad he was really likable and did his job well i liked him. Randy Quaid is great in his serious role surprisingly i liked him. Sally Kellerman is great as the mother i liked her a lot. Marilyn Kagan and Kandice Stroh are both very good as Madge and Deirdre and did what they had to do well as the other two friends.

	schema:reviewBody "Foxes is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s. And unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it Porky's Fast Times at Ridgement High the movie holds up well against time.Its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi Scott Baio remember him? lead a fine young cast that's well worth watching.The film follows four Southern California girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents. The teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties concerts or out on the street. Seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill party or boy away.But rather than condemning them the film is sympathetic blaming absent uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone. And the charismatic cast is impossible to dislike.The film's opening  a long and loving pan  sets the tone for what follows. We see the girls asleep at daybreak amid the objects that define teen girlhood from Twinkies to a picture of a young John Travola while Donna Summer's On the Radio is scored beneath.From there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life. Annie Runaway rocker Cherie Currie is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill. Deirdre Kandice Stroh is the boy crazy drama queen. Madge Marlilyn Stroh is the shy girl in over her head. And Foster is the one with the plan. It's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line Sally Kellerman.It's an almost impossible job and one that Foster ultimately fails at.Despite its age Foxes remains a pleasure to watch. Dated hair clothes and references to Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill haven't hurt the movie.The cinematography is simply stunning with breathtaking filtered shots of the L.A. basin at dawn dusk and at night. Giorgio Moroder adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of Donna Summer and Janis Ian.Perhaps the movie's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around Foster never broke out like the casts of St. Elmo's Fire 1985 or Empire Records 1995. Foxes shows why they should have. But perhaps like Bowling for Soup's song 1985 they just hit a wall.".

And Cherie Currie's wild girl character has potential but lacks screen time and is so doomed she should have a paper taped to her back reading BURY ME.This ponderous melodrama starts off well good actors and some cool Hollywood Boulevard exterior locations.

You could get a part time jobexplore church do volunteer work or practice a musical instrument. You could be in a committed relationship or listen to classical music.These girls are choosing the White Trash option. None of their parents are unemployed or living in a trailer.I always wonder about the hygiene of such kids. It's not like they did a lot of flossing or ate whole foods. They vomited ate junk food smoked drank did drugs and slept around. Wouldn't their breath reek and their clothes be crusty? Disgusting.I think it's completely ridiculous to say that this is the way teens of that era were in So Cal. Some were but plenty weren't.Having said all that this movie had grit and that was its' best quality. The street scenes the freestyle dialog and the concert footage were real and made an impact. Real people do not live in a polished way even the educated and real people do not speak from a script.Great opening and utilization of Donna SummerGiorgio Moroder music. Also nice use of a climax that would inevitably lead to a permanent change in course for the girls. Actions have consequences. The blonde chick was a train wreck waiting to embrace her fate.While it's true that the sheer size commercialism and heat of the Valley can lead to alienation it didn't have to be that way. Back then there were plenty of parks book stores skating rinks and single family homes with pools and orange trees. You just had to choose your friends wisely and stay focused on productive pursuits.".

Disgusting.I think it's completely ridiculous to say that this is the way teens of that era were in So Cal. Some were but plenty weren't.Having said all that this movie had grit and that was its' best quality. The street scenes the freestyle dialog and the concert footage were real and made an impact. Real people do not live in a polished way even the educated and real people do not speak from a script.Great opening and utilization of Donna SummerGiorgio Moroder music. Also nice use of a climax that would inevitably lead to a permanent change in course for the girls. Actions have consequences. The blonde chick was a train wreck waiting to embrace her fate.While it's true that the sheer size commercialism and heat of the Valley can lead to alienation it didn't have to be that way. Back then there were plenty of parks book stores skating rinks and single family homes with pools and orange trees. You just had to choose your friends wisely and stay focused on productive pursuits.";

This film teaches us how to let go even when it is painful and does so with a sweet melancholy but informed style whereby Foster talks philosophically about feeling the pain of life. I loved that scene. It was my favorite scene in the movie actually.The transition from funeral to wedding was meant to show that life does go on and so must we. Baio's skateboarding through a pack of goons and outrunning them was meant to show us that the troubled times will pass and we are meant to get through them to better times.The whole metaphor of moving on and the procession of life is present throughout the film and serves to give us hope in the end.I like this movie though I do not watch it often as it tends to make me melancholy.It shouldn't be viewed by young children and probably only those raised in the 1970's80's would want to.It rates a 7.410 from...the Fiend .".

However in the 1800s a growing Temperance movement arose determined to oppose the destructive habit by any means necessary. This series tells the story of this crusade until it achieved its ultimate goal of passing the 18th Amendment of the US Constitution which imposed prohibition. After that victory the series covers this social reform's disastrous unintended consequences that encouraged clandestine drinking and organized crime while undermining civil liberties and society's respect for the law in ways that still reverberate today.";

	schema:headline " Greatest Legal Miscalculation of 20th Century America Documented in Outstanding BurnsNovick Film";
	schema:reviewBody "My favorite comment in this documentary is offered by Pete Hamill American journalist novelist and essayist who said basically if you want people to brush their teeth pass a law banning toothpaste. And then people will do everything they can to acquire toothpaste illegally and they'll brush their teeth just to spite the law. The unforeseen consequence of Prohibition is that once you take away a person's right to do something that people have always done people will feel the desire to want it much more intensely in the same way if you deny a child all sweets the kid will be sneaking chocolate inside his jacket sleeves. Hamill later says he doesn't drink but he would probably take a swig in front of a government building if the law ever forbade him from doing it. Encouraging moderation is not the same as banning something completely.The other comment worth noting concerns repeal crusader Pauline Sabin who had been entrenched in republican politics prior to 1928. Republican congressmen would vote to adhere to the strictest of prohibition laws as laid out by the Volstead Act and then go to one of Sabin's parties demanding a drink. She concluded that the United States had become a Nation of Hypocrites which is the title of the third installment of Burn's documentary. Sabin becomes an unlikely hero who would sway the country against Prohibition and the eventual repeal of the 18th Amendment of the Constitution the only amendment so dignified. Ironically Daniel Okrent points out that today alcohol is somewhat harder to come by than during Prohibition because of liquor laws underage drinking laws etc. When alcohol was strictly forbidden there was nothing in place to regulate it except for raids on speakeasies and private distilleries.Based in part on Daniel Okrent's Last Call The Rise and Fall of Prohibition Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's Prohibition is a thoroughly entertaining simultaneously humorous and sobering look at one of the strangest episodes in American legal history. The documentary is in three parts the first chronicling the birth of the temperance movement which began in the 1820's almost a century before the ratification of the 18th Amendment. No question that alcohol was a problem for some people mostly among the rural poor but the temperance movement decided alcohol itself was the problem and vowed its eradication by the late 19th century. The first part ends with the ratification of the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution prohibiting not only the sale but importation of alcohol. Part two concerns the passage of the Volstead Act designed to enforce the amendment and the immediate consequences of trying to stop people from drinking and the antithetical results such as lawlessness and bribery. The third and most sobering of the episodes chronicles many of the unintended consequences such as the violence erupting in Chicago and the night club craze. The documentary ends with the movement for the repeal of the 18th Amendment.The unforeseen catastrophes of the 18th Amendment which were designed to heighten American morality and assuage drunkenness turned America into one of the most alcoholicdriven nations among the industrialized world. Americans drank more booze partied more got more drunk and flaunted the law more often during Prohibition than at any other time in the nation's history since after the Civil War even as compared to the present time. Possibly only the 1960's are somewhat comparable to the mayhem of the 1920's.The irony of ironies that the decade begun by the Temperance Movement's victory with the passage of the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution in 1919 would be nicknamed the Roarding Twenties and the Jazz Age. This was not a decade known for drinking milk. This was a decade characterized by cocktail glasses in the hands of flappers dancing on tables to the evocative music of Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Men would be raising giant mugs of frothy beer in underground establishments called speakeasies. Only Prohibition allowed the likes of Al Capone and Lucky Luciano to become wealthy gangsters almost movie stars by today's standards. The leaders of the Temperance Movement particularly the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the AntiSaloon League were appalled when their daughters ran off to speakeasies and night clubs to partake of the forbidden fruit. Strangely Prohibition helped usher in the Night Club culture of America which has continued unabated ever since. All the great night clubs famous for their booze music and dancing such as the Cotton Club and the Stork Club were incepted when alcohol was supposed to be illegal.For some reason I didn't think Prohibition permeated into so many aspects of American life during its enforcement from 1920 through 1932. People could open small businesses in their basements and make a fortune through bootlegging and then be hauled away under the Volstead Act. The rise of the Chicago Gang syndicate became a prototype for similar syndicates across the country all vying for their bootlegging territory. At one point citizens were legally compelled to snitch on neighbors suspected of bootlegging. The story as presented by BurnsNovick is as compelling as any action thriller being produced today. A great movie of American history with all the elements that make a great story. Essentially it's a legal thriller with sex violence and lots of booze. Lots of it.".

	schema:headline " Another Winner From Ken Burns";
	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to making full coverage documentaries you can't beat the work of Ken Burns. Prohibition is another fine illustration of that.This five and one half hour miniseries shown in three parts on PBS and available on DVD never bogs down. That's pretty amazing right there. I would think it difficult to have that kind of running time and not have at least a couple spots where the story gets boring. It never does and is a tribute to Ken's film making ability.Prohibition describes how we got there what it did to our country and why the 18th Amendment banning booze became the only Amendment to be repealed. It was doomed to fail from the start but nobody saw it at the beginning. It almost singlehandedly brought about organized crime in America a problem that has yet to be repealed.Ken Burns covers it all very well and his good name in these documentary efforts never fails to bring in the big names for voiceover work. In this case Tom Hanks Patricia Clarkson Adam Arkin Jeremy Irons John Lithgow etc. etc..Although it was never mentioned I couldn't help but think of the parallels to modern day marijuana laws. When you have a product that millions of Americans want and you make it illegal the money from that product goes to gangs that provide it and with that all the violence that goes along with those gangs. You can't legislate morality as the 18th Amendment surely showed. And pot is much less harmful than alcohol.Another great job by Ken Burns.".

Seeing this film puts lots of things into perspective.On the one hand the concerns about alcohol consumption were and still are real. What the film shows so clearly is that the solutions didn't solve anything plus many new problems were created. A new criminal enterprise was spawned and there simply were not enough law enforcement people to monitor arrest and try those in the booze smuggling business. It was doomed to failure and we are better off today as a result.As history now witnesses prohibition failed. It was replaced by laws which instead of making production and sale of alcoholic beverages illegal make it illegal to be drunk in public or perform certain activities while under the influence. Which should have been the approach all along.I can't help thinking of prohibition alongside the current Tea Party movement. While both of them have certain admirable goals in both cases you can't charge ahead with a tunnel vision that neglects all the other things that will be impacted.".

It was also part and parcel with deep racism and xenophobia  often aimed against the very migrants it was claimed to be there to help. Prohibition was supposed to stop poverty and make life safer but it did the opposite  it destroyed the 5th largest industry in the nation and other reliant jobs creating mass unemployment at a time with no government unemployment system. It created organized crime which is tied now to drug prohibition.The view of the local bar as being a center of commerce and community for the lower classes who did not have private clubs was not the view held by those who saw alcohol as the central evil of their era. But then they wanted easy answers... not accurate ones.People in that era were told in the first mass political propaganda machine ever that alcohol was the cause of all their social ills that domestic violence prostitution poverty gambling and many other things were all due to the bottle. They were told that with no alcohol people could be made 'better'  society would be better. All would be well. Somehow few people questioned the information they were getting but then they had not experienced that sort of propaganda before.There was a good discussion of the long era in which the prohibitionist movement grew and of the sudden increase in alcohol production and the result of the rise of groups that were against drinking or let alcoholics help each other stay sober.THE MISSING PART? However there was no discussion at all of why so many people in that era drank to excess or why any substance or other obsession becomes the center of self destructive behavior. After allyou can't sell anything to people  including excessive amounts of alcohol to people who won't swallow it down.The why of all substance misuse is nearly always tied into feelings of emotional pain and the desire to escape them hopelessness despair trauma and a desire to have a mental 'vacation'. Looking at things in this way is less popular than anger. It doesn't let people have easy answers to complicated problems or give them people to vilify. It fails to let them 'off the hook' when it comes to looking at their entire way of life. Anything can be used this way including ideologies and theologies.The fact is that nearly all the people in that era lived in abject poverty  had no real rights. There were no government enforced rights at all  no workers rights no right to equal housing there were no unemployment benefits or disability system. Child labor was common and sweat shops were normal. Jobs paid so little that you could starve to death while fully employed working 12 hour days. People were worked extreme hours in dangerous conditions and could be fired for anything including being too sick to come to work having a kid to care for or for refusing to do a thing that was wrong or even illegal. You could be fired for not going to the employers church see the job requirements 'Dwight L Moody' met when hired by a relative.Empires of money were made by people willing to do 'all the wrong things' for cash. The employees  employers knew this and that all jobs were like that so you could not quit a job  find better treatment. Nobody was willing to say no to greed or on the job cruelty. After all the entire prohibition movement came into being in a US shaped by men like Daniel Webster who believed the poor were poor because of their inferiority their race their original nationality and that the US should be CLASSIEST and keep voting a privilege of the wealthy... education too. It was not a good thing to be poor in a world shaped by folks like Webster.Read The Jungle for a look at US migrant life in the early 20th century. The migrants in it found the US was not the new wonderful world they had hoped for. It was terrible dirty and filled with poverty. They rapidly discovered that nobody could be trusted in the cities that most US city people were con artists who preyed on each other constantly and had no ethics that jobs were hard to get  easy to lose that their family members died of poverty the cold starvation lack of medical care surrounded by people who COULD help but would not. At the end of the work day or in despair over no work many chose to disappear into a bottle. Knowing what they faced at home men stayed at the bars fearing going back to the pressures of their impoverished family. Yet nobody was campaigning to STOP the conditions that sent people off to drink in order to cope.It was easier to blame booze and ban it and more satisfying as you could feel superior than it was to go after the CAUSES of mass alcoholism and address them by reeling in the abuse of power and addressing poverty.It still is easier to use the blunt instrument of the law to deal with the societal results of greed and cruelty and it is still done everyday.".

	schema:reviewBody "Daniel Okrent's Last Call The Rise and Fall of Prohibition and Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's Prohibition miniseries were two similar projects that began together resulting in two different end products. Together both provide a rather detailed account not only of Prohibition's place in American history but the events leading up to such the results of repeal and the longlasting societal impact of the entire matter. Separate both are still strong informative and entertaining yet each tend to focus on different themes that sometimes do not intermingle and the result is noticeable.Ken Burns in his trademarked fashion intermingles fantastically original photos and video with colorful interviews from subjectmatter experts and firsthand histories overlaced with celebrity voiceovers makes learning hip and brings about a passion for a dark but necessary time in American history. Burns' documentary was too light in certain instances where a deeper look at American history would have benefited the story. Okrent's novel definitely fills in such details that Burns either ignored or edited out but was definitely too heavy at times with whole sections coming across as a historical text book rather than an entertaining narrative.Burns and Okrent as well enlighten 21stCentury audiences to the fact that Prohibition what can be now considered a silly arrangement was not only responsible for the rise of Jazz the introduction of mixed drinks and the invention of speed boats but also led to very beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement and the outright success of Women's Suffrage. Naturally Burns provides much attention to that of the gangsters of the era particularly Chicago's Al Capone. But again he provides just enough details for a satisfactory display of information yet fails to get deeper. Similarly this occurs when discussing the role of the Church and the Prohibition movement. Dry Congressmen and Senators knew how to convince their Baptist and Methodist ministers to use the pulpit to condemn the evils of alcohol particularly in the MidWest states. Likewise Prohibition was an outcry not just against alcohol but also against the rise of poor immigrants filling America's urban centers. The Irish the Germans the Italians all known for enjoying wine and spirits and all Catholics became a scary threat for decent Protestant country folks. Cutting off immigrants from their alcohol was a way to ensure that these new Americans were productive members of society not a burden of filthy drunkards. Burns did not spend too much time on these ideals. However Burns attention to detail and crafting of a narrative tale is shown in his vision and with what is presented. He does keep entertainment at the forefront of his documentary much like what he has done in the past especially with his mustsee Baseball series. Some indirect humor is presented with history playing the comedian to a more nave time. Burns does get political with some of his views but at no time are such views sobering enough to prevent the viewer from seeking out a drink.".

Made with a ton of great movie footage and stills and lots of tidbits about the history of drinking in America  it's out of control pervasiveness among men especially working class men that led to the push for prohibition that puts the now ridiculous seeming constitutional amendment in a somewhat more understandable light. That in turn explains the odd confluence of its backers from religious conservatives to well meaning social progressives looking to save the poor from themselves to blueblood WASPS who hated working class immigrants who drank more openly to women fighting for the right to vote and who saw how often alcohol contributed to domestic violence. The film also does a great job in showing how a law that tens of millions of Americans will simply ignore is much worse than no law at all as it sows the seeds of disregard and contempt for the law as well creating a fertile ground for criminals to give people what they want in a black market. Much the same arguments are going on right now about other vice laws from marijuana to prostitution to proposed laws on fatty and sugary foods. One of the central questions of any democracy is how much and where does the government have a right to intrude into people's lives for the greater good. It's an important and complicated question and one the series does a good job of raising. But at over 5 hours it starts to run a little thin and the points and stories start to get a bit repetitive. I'm glad I saw it and enjoyed myself quite a bit but unlike many documentaries by Burns and his equally talented brother Ric I don't think I'll feel a need to rewatch it anytime soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always wondered how the US ever passed laws prohibiting alcohol. Such an amazingly common thing today it would be like banning caffeine or soda. This six hour story is told well from all sides and it provides clarity as to the insane and radical motives behind the Volstead Act and how it backfired in every way. While the video and photos are all rather dated being from the 1910s and 1920s the interviews of experts historians and people with reallife stories really come together well. The narration is also great and uses some of the best names in the film business.This is a long series about 6 hours. Ken Burns' direction is poignant and wellpaced. It gives you time to think about the meaning and the historical impact of each chapter of this story which touches on many decades.I feel I know understand an important part of American history that never made sense to me. Concepts like Bootleggers and Baptists being aligned and the role of the gangsters in society become crystal clear after viewing this film. I had no idea how vicious and immoral the attacks on Al Smith were by the Herbert Hoover camp. Politics and police seem violently corrupt in this era. You learn a lot about life laws religion and politics in a difficult and bitter era the Great Depression. Most importantly you are reminded of the fact that US was built on Freedomsand Prohibition is such an amazing violation of this. It's a historical guidepost to preserving our freedoms going forward.The story of the Roaring 20s flappers the speakeasy the rumrunners and ironically how the postprohibition era was favorable to women and equality and stories I'd never imagined.FDR had three priorities when he took office 1 regulate the banks 2 cut federal spending 3 legalize beer. He won by a landslide. On a funny note Utah voted to repeal the Volstead Act rather quickly. Amazing given that that state has spend the last 80 years trying to restrict it! This three DVD series is worthy of a weekend of your time. Thanks PBS for this fine historical film and Ken Burns for another amazing tale.".

Looking at the credits while typing this John Lithgow Tom Hanks Sam Waterston this program is loaded with liberals are there any non liberal contributors in this?

I'm only putting this review out here to raise the case that PBS is not the unbiased network it has always said it is. It would serve it's own purposes better if it was truly open minded. Stop with the NPR all things considered treatment talking down to us you wont convince us that you are correct anymore. Interesting material definitely done to entertain a liberal viewership which I guess is all PBS has left it's a shame that all things were NOT considered. 6 of 10 I learned that the bible thumpers got us an income tax in an alliance with progressives.I have about zero trust that this series will cover all bases or just focus on the lower class's drinks like beer.

He's grown fond of the black tenants and particularly of Fanny the wife of a black radical he's maybe fallen in love with Lanie a mixed race girl he's lost interest in redecorating his home. Joyce his mother has not relinquished this interest and in one of the film's most hilarious sequences gives her Master Charge card to Marge a black tenant and appoints her decorator.";

	schema:reviewBody "After 33 years things have certainly changed but this film still touches on issues that were very controversial back then and even now some of the events that take place are subject to debate. This story is about a young white entrepreneur named Elgar Enders Beau Bridges and he buys a New York tenement in a ghetto with plans on having the tenants move out so he can renovate it into his own place to live. He moves in and meets Marge Pearl Bailey who tells him about the people that live there and he finds out that many of the tenants owe back rent for several months. Elgar also meets Franny Diana Sands and they both seem to like each other but she is in love with Copee Louis Gossett Jr. who doesn't like Elgar and is always threatening him. Elgar gets a lot of flack from his parents and his mother Joyce Lee Grant who doesn't understand him says she will help him with new curtains. Elgar meets a light skinned black woman named Lanie Marki Bey and he falls in love and wants to marry her but Franny shows up at his door one day and tells him that she is pregnant with his child.This film was directed by the great Hal Ashby who makes his directorial debut after spending many years working as an editor. Ashby had worked on some of Norman Jewison's films and the two had become good friends. Jewison wanted to help Ashby on his first film and he was one of the producers. The script is sharply written and each character is very well detailed so that by the end of the film the viewer has a good understanding of each of them. The script does tackle racism and its look at on both perspectives of whites and blacks. Ashby uses colors to make points like the all white house and white clothing that the Enders have while the run down tenement that is occupied by mainly black residents has mainly gray tones with some of the interior shots having red. Along with the sharp script and direction this film has several very good performances in it. Lee Grant picked up an Oscar Nomination for her funny role as Bridges mother and the scene with her and Pearl Bailey is a classic. Bailey was making a rare film appearance and she would only appear in one more film until her death. Arguably the best performance comes from Sands. She shows so many layers to her character Franny and if a role ever deserved an Oscar Nomination it was this one. She's terrific here and sadly she would pass away from cancer only 4 years later. Bridges was still a very young actor when he was cast and even though he hadn't yet developed into the fine actor that he is today his performance is still sincere. Several up and coming actors appear in small roles like Susan Anspach Robert Klein Gloria Hendry Trish Van Devere and Hector Elizondo. After all the time that has passed this film still comes across as poignant and pertinent.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was pleasantly surprised with the complexity of The Landlord.  It was brilliantly directed.  The cutting between different scenes was effortless and added depth to the storyline.  There was plenty of symbolism which is one of the things I always look for and enjoy in a film.  For instance when Elgar Bridges and his father are having an argument in the bathroom during a costume party there is a quick cutaway to another man in the bathroom who has on a gun holster which I thought was symbolic of the 'shootout' that was going on between Elgar and his father.  In addition the Enders family is constantly seen wearing white and their home is decorated in white.I thought the acting was top notch.  Beau Bridges was very convincing as a naive sheltered man learning to appreciate and embrace a different culture. But the movie is so much deeper than that...  It dealt with people trying to break free from stereotypes people struggling to be proud of who they are and be accepted for who they are and some people not even knowing who they are trying to find their niche.I love the scene at the party that was supposedly in honor of Elgar where more than one person tells him what it feels like to go from being an outcast to being the envy of everyone.  If I remember correctly they likened it to you having a mole in the middle of your forehead and people are basically disgusted by it.  But then one day that becomes the thing to have and people begin to draw moles on their faces but you have a real mole right there on your forehead prominent for everyone to see and suddenly you are it and your self esteem is taken to new heights.  It seems like everything would be fine for you now but I also interpreted that speech as saying that at the time blacks felt like they were a fad that might eventually fade out.  I thought the words were very powerful as well as the way the scene was carried out.I don't think a film such as this could be pulled off properly now because there is the constant threat of backlash if things aren't completely PC not to mention the fact that things are so different now.  I think this film was made at the right time but it still rings true 31 years later.  And thank goodness for the satisfying and realistic ending.".

	schema:headline " witty and with enough emotional depth and intelligence to carry the subject matter good debut for Ashby";
	schema:reviewBody "As one of the scruffy underdog filmmakers of the 1970s who's career unfortunately faltered in the 80s before his untimely death at 59 Hal Ashby was good at taking a set of characters and a particular idea or theme and getting under the surface just enough to make a mark while also keeping it an oddly entertaining and accessible as a picture for the art houses. Also it shows Ashby coming out of his cocoon of editing jobs he even won an Oscar for Jewison's In the Heat of the Night by giving the Landlord a very particular rhythm. Many times he'll just let a scene play out giving the actors the freedom to work with the script their way and then other times he'll implement montage or just a subliminal cutaway or not so subliminal as Lee Grant envisions an African tribe going to the Park Slope building and a whole pack of black babies upon hearing about a little 'accident' her stepson caused late in the film.I was really struck by how he uses experimentation for equal uses of humor abstraction and to just feel out the mood of the characters in the scene. Like when Brides runs to meet with Lanie at her school and it's intercut with images from Fanny at her apartment and Lanie and a couple of other things. It can be called 'European' and Ashby was an admitted fan of Godard's but it feels unique to the sensibility of the production and the 'radical' feeling of the period. Meanwhile Ashby has the best photography back up a firsttime director could ask for Gordon Willis and Michael Chapman who give the film a look sometimes of lightness especially when Elgar is at the family home and the walls are all a bland white or seem to be then other times they light it darker like in a more intimate setting like Elgar and Lanie out by the beach at night or just when at the Park Slope apartment. A scene especially with Elgar and Fanny is effective not simply because she actually comments on how the red light makes her look a certain way it's the timing of the actors the awkward but strong sexual tension and the red light and the soft soul music coming up that makes it one of the best scenes Ashby's ever filmed thanks to the right team.If the style verges on being a little dated here and there like in the opening minutes as Elgar talks to the camera and says what he intends to do with the tenement or those extreme closeups of Elgar kissing with Lanie which are quite striking on their own its attitude towards the pure human problems of race haven't diminished that much. I liked seeing Bridges who is spoton as the total naive future yuppie who's heart is in the right place but confused how to really go about it as the new landlord interact with the other apartment dwellers their 'welcoming' by chasing him away with a flowered pot in his hands or at the party when after getting him good and drunk tell him what it's really all about in firstperson takes. And most of all it's funny and challenging to see especially during a tense period around 1969 when it was filmed how essential decency on either side of the race coin could get complicated by love and lust of the rich family understandably not understanding how Elgar could go through this not to mention the eventual 'mixed' dating and the pregnancy and at the same time the tenees never totally knowing why aside from foolish design ambitions wanted to run the place to start with.The best laughs end up coming from the awkward moments and the obvious ones as the subtle moments are meant to be more quiet and the 'big' laughs to come from the interaction of not just in terms of race but class watch as everyone in the building uses the drapes from Joyce Lee Grant in a well deserved Oscar nom performance as clothes and headdressing or when Joyce has some pot liquor with Marge who knows her better than her own family probably does. And who can resist the NAACP joke? Or a throwaway joke about dressing up as a historical figure for a costume ball? Ashby and his writers both screenwriter and novelist were AfricanAmericans know not to slam every point home either which uplifts the comedy to an honest playing field which means that when a scene like the quasiclimax when Copee finds out about the pregnancy and flips out with an ax at Elgar it's not really all that jokey when it easily could've been played as such for an exploitation effect. Only the very ending which feels complicated by a sort of need to tidy things up with Elgar Janie and the baby feels sort of forced not helped by the end song not too ironic called God Bless the Children.But as it stands the Landlord is provocative fun if that makes sense as it works as cool satire led by surefire performances Bridges has rarely been this good at being true to a mostly unsympathetic character and it points the way for a career that the director would have where oddball slices of life wouldn't mean there wasn't larger points being made. It's one of the best bets as an obscure find a filmbuff can have from 1970.".

Its take on racism is as fresh and complex as it was in 1970. In fact one other reviewer is dead wrong about the film having no intrinsic style. It is a film loaded with style. And if I may add if this reviewer thinks that all films aren't made in the editing room than you're sadly mistaken. The film is as complicated multilayered messy and ultimately indefinable as the problem of racism itself. There is no way to honestly treat this subject by making a neat little package film. We've been peeling this onion for hundreds of years and we'll be peeling it for hundreds more. Racism is as deeply ingrained in our society as our love of money and power. This film is only a chore to sit through if you have an aversion to fantastic writing unbelievably great characters amazing cinematography brilliant editing and yes a complexity born of its subject. A film for the ages. Now if only the ages will catch up.".

Beau Bridges in this and Gaily Gaily showed what a wonderful young actor he was every bit as good as his brother but never made that Star leap.  Lee Grant one of the best is coy and cunning and wonderful as Bridges' mother and Diana Sands is heartbreaking with excellent work from Lou Gossett and Pearl Bailey.Great music and a topical plot you can't help but get involved with this rich young man's plight.  One of Ashby's better films.  A high 8 out of 10.  Best performance  Lee Grant.".

Beau Bridges in this and Gaily Gaily showed what a wonderful young actor he was every bit as good as his brother but never made that Star leap.  Lee Grant one of the best is coy and cunning and wonderful as Bridges' mother and Diana Sands is heartbreaking with excellent work from Lou Gossett and Pearl Bailey.Great music and a topical plot you can't help but get involved with this rich young man's plight.  One of Ashby's better films.  A high 8 out of 10.  Best performance  Lee Grant.";

When I found that there wasn't too much background footage I stuck with it to see where it was going. Now I understand what the writer and filmmaker were going for the perception and direction of the black community at this period of time and the integration of a naive white person in the midst of it. But I found it to be slow moving not due to the actors  who do a decent job  and wondering where it was going and ultimately when it was going to end. I know that tons of people like and love this film. And I'm not saying it's awful but I did lose interest in it very early on.".

	schema:reviewBody "Movies that deal with race have often been awkward things. One of the biggest problems is they tend to be horribly patronising in tone many of them looking essentially at how white people can help black people. Most of them were of course written by someone white which while it doesn't necessarily make it illinformed it doesn't tend to help either. The Landlord is one of the few from this era that is based on source material by a black writer novelist Kristin Hunter. Hunter's novel was adapted by Bill Gunn who is also black. Of all the pictures I have seen dealing with race in America it is by far the most confrontational and really the only of this period that really challenges white social supremacy as well as overt racism.The late 60s and early 70s was really the age of the oddlooking movie especially with all the new young directors that were cropping up. The Landlord was the debut of Hal Ashby a former editor who had recently won an Oscar for his very fine job on another racerelated movie In the Heat of the Night. Ashby has a somewhat blunt approach and like most young directors seems to be trying to make his mark with lots of unusual but ultimately pointless camera angles and extremely obvious symbolism. One thing that is very striking is how the scenes at the Enders family home are very white and the scenes at the flat block are very black. This is not done so much with set and costume design but with lighting striplight brightness for the former and gloomy halflight for the latter. In fact the movie might as well be in monochrome for all the actual colour tone there is in it. The blackwhite metaphor of this is a little heavyhanded but at least it also serves the purpose of highlighting the stark difference in quality of life. What is probably best about Ashby's method here is the distance he puts between camera and subject often putting a bit of scenery in between us and the action making us feel like snooping witnesses. He will then suddenly take us by surprise with a closeup as a character delivers some key line of dialogue.In line with Mr Ashby having been an editor The Landlord is very much an editor's movie. This was also the age of weird editing pattern and there is a lot of cutting backandforth mixing various scenes together. Sometimes this is rather effective for example the powerful montage of schoolchildren towards the end or the sightgag inserts of what Lee Grant is imagining when she finds out she will have a black grandchild but mostly it is just a little distracting and because it is so mechanical it threatens to alienate the audience from the material. However shining through the rather ostentatious style are some very fine acting performances especially from Bridges Grant and Diana Sands notable for their realism in spite of the occasionally bizarre situations they are in. And what's more in amongst this choppy editing is a story which is at turns comical thoughtprovoking and gently poignant which alongside its hardhitting stance ultimately carries a message of hope and humanity.".

The scene then cutaways to Elgar running to talk to another girl for advicewhile Fanny is telling Elgar this.Copee is a black jealous and violent boyfriend of Fanny.When he learns that Fanny is pregnant and he is not the father he goes berserk beating Fanny into telling him who the father is.Once Copee learns who it is he grabs an axe and goesafter Elgar!!!!I loved the film because it breaks several stereotypesIt shows that color doesn't matter when we are talking about love it's all about the feelings a man and woman feel for each other that is important.Elgar represents a group of conscious men who don't see Blacks and other minorities as inferior. In fact throughout the film Elgar is actually happier with hisblack friends than with his own mother.There are several messages about the dysfunctional family.Elgar's mother Lee Grant is a rich white woman who has everything yet she is a cold miserable woman.It was interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. Copee as a crazy  jealous boyfriend . He usually plays good guy roles but in this role he nails his part by playing a guy whohas completely lost it.The movie was directed by Hal Ashby a man who has directedseveral important cult films of our time includingBeing There 1979 film with Peter Sellers  Shampoo Great 1975 film with Warren Beatty and Julie Christie Coming Home A good 1978 film with Jane FondaThis is a very good movie hard to find on video but I highly recommend it.".

Lee Grant is terrific as Bridge's mother and earned an Oscar nomination for supporting actress and no less memorable are Diana Sands Pearl Bailey and Louis Gossett Jr. Bridges is winning as the landlord who arrives to make change and winds up being changed and Trish Van Devere is funny in her one scene.

And while it was meant as a bit of shocking film in its day today it seems a tad dated and Bridges' character a bit unlikable.I think aside from this mixed focus I was also disappointed because the film was directed by the same man that did the delicious black comedy HAROLD AND MAUDE.

Bridges plays Elgar Enders the son of a wealthy  but pretty despondent  landlady Lee Grant. Grouchy and pretty bigoted this woman cares only about her AfricanAmerican tenants paying their rent. So when Elgar takes over the apartment building he not only decides to change things for the better but he also begins to develop a relationship with one of the women in the building.Like many movies that came out around 1970 this one features numerous jump cuts between totally different scenes. I don't know the specific purpose of this but I get the feeling that they may have done it to create a sense of the confusion pervading the world due to the unprecedented changes occurring around that time. But I will say that it helps to stress Elgar's disgust with his family's ignorance and scorn of the world outside theirs. You really have to root for what he does as landlord of this building just as a complete rejection of everything that he's been raised to believe and do.All in all I wholeheartedly recommend this movie. Maybe it goes a little overboard in practically beatifying Elgar but he really deserves it. Lee Grant's character will probably make your skin crawl. Louis Gossett Jr.  whom I previously only thought of as Fiddler on Roots  plays one nasty dude though we understand why he's like he is. Ditto Prof. Dubois Melvin Stewart.So see it. You'll probably like it. Also starring Robert Klein and Hector Elizondo in early roles.".

	schema:headline " Culture Clash";
	schema:reviewBody "Our hero here is Elgar Winthrop Julius Enders Beau Bridges age 29 a White rich and very nave man who much to the disgust of his hateful bourgeoisie family cheerily buys a rundown urban tenement building filled with Black poor and very sophisticated adults and streetwise kids. Elgar thus sets himself up to be caught in the middle of an inevitable culture clash.Director Hal Ashby creates a cinematic social commentary suited to the late 1960s and early 70s that is both comedic and thoughtful. Elgar's tenement dwellers wrestle with serious issues like how to pay the rent. Elgar's snobbish mother worries about what Elgar wears to an elitist banquet. The plot doesn't flow in a traditional way instead it feels jerky long scenes are followed by very short scenes followed again by long scenes and so on.This change in rhythm brought about by crosscutting amplifies ironic contrasts between these two social classes. The resulting editing is satisfying in that the comedy takes the edge off of the anger attendant to the more serious subtext. This film style works well until the final twenty minutes when the plot becomes too heavy handed and alarming. The bow and arrow scene in the middle is okay but the fearful ax scene toward the end sans humor is not okay because it disrupts tonal balance.Ashby also wanted the cinematography to be darker in the tenement scenes than in Elgar's aristocratic family segments. The result is cinematography so dark in ghetto interior scenes I could sometimes not distinguish people from furniture.Casting and acting are quite acceptable. The standout performance is Diana Sands as Fanny Miss Sepia of 1957. And then there's wonderful Pearl Baily I never realized she had been that young looking.Social commentary films do not usually age well. And The Landlord certainly shows its age. I kept expecting a Simon and Garfunkel song at almost any moment. Overall this film is an enjoyable throwback to a bygone era of hippies social consciousness and the generation gap. It has its flaws but hippie Ashby gets his message across effectively owing to an adroit mix of seriousness and humor.".

Elgar thus sets himself up to be caught in the middle of an inevitable culture clash.Director Hal Ashby creates a cinematic social commentary suited to the late 1960s and early 70s that is both comedic and thoughtful. Elgar's tenement dwellers wrestle with serious issues like how to pay the rent. Elgar's snobbish mother worries about what Elgar wears to an elitist banquet. The plot doesn't flow in a traditional way instead it feels jerky long scenes are followed by very short scenes followed again by long scenes and so on.This change in rhythm brought about by crosscutting amplifies ironic contrasts between these two social classes. The resulting editing is satisfying in that the comedy takes the edge off of the anger attendant to the more serious subtext. This film style works well until the final twenty minutes when the plot becomes too heavy handed and alarming. The bow and arrow scene in the middle is okay but the fearful ax scene toward the end sans humor is not okay because it disrupts tonal balance.Ashby also wanted the cinematography to be darker in the tenement scenes than in Elgar's aristocratic family segments. The result is cinematography so dark in ghetto interior scenes I could sometimes not distinguish people from furniture.Casting and acting are quite acceptable. The standout performance is Diana Sands as Fanny Miss Sepia of 1957. And then there's wonderful Pearl Baily I never realized she had been that young looking.Social commentary films do not usually age well. And The Landlord certainly shows its age. I kept expecting a Simon and Garfunkel song at almost any moment. Overall this film is an enjoyable throwback to a bygone era of hippies social consciousness and the generation gap. It has its flaws but hippie Ashby gets his message across effectively owing to an adroit mix of seriousness and humor.";

	schema:reviewBody "I came upon this movie after just seeing someone post it on a blog a few days ago. I had never heard of it but according to the trailer it sure looked like a comedy. And it was to an extent I should say a Black Comedy. Thanks to the smart and adroit direction of Hal Ashby The Landlord is pretty funny considering the uneven and misappropriated dialogue. We must consider the authors of this story who happen to be African American. I know if it were written by White authors the bias would be pretty different. Nevertheless it seems genuine if not entirely plausible. Elgar is a confused rich kid in his late 20's who has an ambivalent and dysfunctional relationship with his family. Eager to leave the nest and prove himself he sets out to buy a Brownstone in the middle of a slum near park Slope New York. When he arrives as the new landlord and very wet behind the ears he instantly realizes he gets more than what he bargained for a group of Black tenants who owe back rent for two months or more. The group is a somewhat Mottley Cruw that doesn't seem to take a liking to him at first but sense that he's easy prey because he's young polite and inexperienced. Things are somewhat comical watching him interact like a fish out of water and trying to fit in. His initial intention is to evict the tenants systematically so he can renovaye the slum house into a chic bachelor pad. But his plans fall by the wayside as he gets immersed in his duties as a landlord neighbor and even acquaintance. The story loses its humorous tone after midway and turns serious and frightening. Later there are brief moments of sad humor and pathos. Elgar gets one of the Black tenants pregnant falls in love with a Mulatto woman he met at a Night club and struggles with this odd situation he has put himself into. Even though he openly shuns his family and their wishes he can't quite handle the consequences of his choices. Ultimately the story is a fairly sad study on young male naivety and a lesson in culture clashes.Lee Grant is terrific as his cloying and snooty mother. Jeff Bridges shows warmth and capability in an early role. Lou Gossett is interesting as the irate cuckold who wishes to be every other ethnicity but Black. Diana Sands is very good in a role that requires strain humility and shame. The direction of Hal Ashby is what engineers this frantic fable. He intersperses fantasy sequences and dialogue nuances to illustrate a point. Not all of them work but they help the continuity of the experience. Not bad for a first outing as a director.".

But here  really quite good! Lee Grant plays Bridges' mother and does so with panache being the classic bitchy White snob. She's great fun. Diana Sands and a very young Louis Gossett have impressive roles as a married couple who face an ultimate challenge.This film was a failure and didn't stay around long at the box office. Perhaps it's because the trailer gave people the impression it was a comedy. And word of mouth told everyone is was actually a somewhat depressing drama with occasional humorous situations.

Thank God there was a time that wasn't PC and things could be shown as they were and not as someone wished they would be.As America struggled with the issues of race and prejudice a movie such as this came along and tried to show that color shouldn't be a barrier to true love and friendship. Nowadays it's nothing for blacks and whites to mix. The barriers have been somewhat broken although some may say it was forced on white america with all the affirmative action laws and equal rights.I always thought Beau Bridges was one of the least attractive actors whatwith his big bushy eyebrows  but after I saw The Landlord he was actually somewhat handsome and cute in his 20's! And the fact that the lead actor falls in love with a lightskinned blackwoman wasn't lost on me either. Hollywood will still only use lighter black womenHalley Berry Vanessa Williams types for lead roles in movies. Beau Bridges even mentions it to his mother that she might like his new black girlfriend because she was very light. I guess they were ahead of the times back then!But we all know it's so as not to offend WHITE AMERICA.And there was also the rascism that is directed from blacks towards whites that still exist today. It's like some blacks think ALL whites are bad people. That we all are descendants from the white slaveowners! Many of us came over as immigrants from European countries and had nothing to do with slavery!All in all The Landlord was a good movie. I almost thought I was watching the Black Entertainment channel! But it was AMC! And it was good. And there was a lot of symbolism in the movie like the white family wearing alot of white clothing and living in a white house! And it also shows that if you get to know someone and act like a human being with a heart color won't matter at all. People are people on the inside and that is what we need to look at not what is on the outside! We can appreciate our diversities and enjoy them..not ridicule them.

The story centers on Elgar Beau Bridges a white man from a wealthy upper class family who moves into a lower class apartment building in New York. Elgar takes over the building as the landlord intending to evict all of the African American tenants living inside. However as he gets to know his neighbors and develops relationships with them he begins to learn valuable life lessons about race and responsibility. There's a lot to admire in Hal Ashby's Landlord. Very few films before or since have tackled the topic of race and presented it in such a straight forward light. Scenes such as the party in the middle of the movie where the tenants discuss with Elgar what it is to be a minority at the time or one towards the end of the film where an African American activist breaks down and goes on a rant of racial self hate are both chilling and unforgettable. The performances are outstanding as well. Beau Bridges is very convincing as the thoughtless naive Elgar who grows to embrace the African American culture. Dianna Sands is the standout of the movie playing the tragic Fanny with such real emotion and likability that you can't help but feel for her character during the more dramatic scenes of the film. Lou Gossett Jr Pearl Bailey Mel Stewart and Lee Grant are also great in their respective roles.That said the film does have its share of problems. The most prominent being the tone and the story's progression. Labelled as a comedy and a drama the film has drastic tonal shifts that makes it as a whole seem uneven. Take for instance a scene where Elgar's mother visits him in the apartment building. The disapproving mother comes over to chastise her son about integrating with the black tenants only for Fanny to show up and reveal that she's pregnant with the Landlord's baby. The mother's paranoia is played for laughs as she envisions herself as a a plantation owner with many dark skinned grandchildren. In the scene immediately afterward we're shown Fanny and her husband Copee as she reveals the affair and her pregnancy. The next few minutes of the sequence are absolutely terrifying as the enraged Copee hunts down and tries to murder Elgar with an axe. The rushed pregnancy plot takes the third act into almost melodrama territory with the messages seeming more obviousforced and the film's ending becomes a bit sloppy as a result.The unevenness also shows with the characters. Fanny and Elgar get a lot of development and screen time while both of their love interests are strangely left behind. Lanie Elgar's biracial girlfriend never gets enough screen time for their confessed love towards the end of the movie to seem as genuine as it should. Likewise Copee pops in and out of the movie solely to perform his role as the angry cheated on husband. Both seem more like plot devices to display the messages they represent rather than being fully fleshed out characters themselves. Even with the development Elgar suffers a bit as well. The mentioned third act pregnancy plot takes the character back to the thoughtlessness he displayed in the beginning of the film making it difficult to like him or care much about his trials in the end. The Landlord is a good film with biting social and racial commentary however the melodramatic elements in the story and uneven script hold it back from being truly great.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beau Bridges buys a New York apartment building and moves in to manage it. That is basically the premise. But there is much more to it than that. I can usually tell from fadein whether a movie is one that I can get into and if I buy into the characters' world in other words if it feels authentic or not. And this film really delivers. To begin with Beau really must have it as many women come on to him including the black tenants. His eccentric mother played wonderfully by Lee Grant is a real hoot but the heart of the film belongs to the people who live dream struggle and love in this apartment building. One of which is a married black woman who falls for him and when her husband finds out all hell breaks loose. I feel like my meager words can't really capture what this film does the life of the early 1970s in a borough of New York. With direction by Hal Ashby the film has an affection for its complicated characters and their drive to get through today and to have a better tomorrow. And Pearl Bailey adds her sassy self to the mix. This is really one of the best 1970s films I've ever seen. Watch The Landlord and see Beau Bridges at his best as he is in the raw reality of 1970s New York.".

The actual star is Caucasian Beau Bridges who's a rich son of Lee Grant who wants his own place so he buys a tenement building to convert into his own pad but is reluctant to throw the mostly darkskinned borders out. I'll stop there and just say that the script by Bill Gunn from Kristin Hunter's novel provides many satirical moments and a nice dramatic turn near the end and Ashby's quick cutting of some scenes not to mention his lighting techniques provide ample interest throughout. But the tone was uneven to me to the point that I sometimes was confused as to what was the point of some sequences or the ways some characters turn out to be.

Bridges was afraid he might really be killed by an angry black mob. While uneven and heavyhanded at times it's a valuable social document of a mostlyforgotten era.

Celebi transports itself and a boy named Sam 40 years into the future to the present day where Pokemon trainer Ash his faithful Pikachu and his friends Brock and Misty are traveling through Johto.  Sam and Ash become fast friends once they discover the other's mutual love for Pokemon Sam's vintage Pokeball with screwon top is a great moment.  Together they decide to protect Celebi from the villain of the story the Team Rocket agent aptly named Vicious who is hellbent on capturing Celebi for his own ends.  Will Ash and Sam be able to protect Celebi from Vicious' Dark Balls?  Where does Suicune fit into the picture? Will Jessie James and Meowth have bigger parts in this movie than before? And just who is Sam really?Like with the first 3 movies if you go into the movie deciding that you're automatically going to hate it no matter what simply because it's Pokemon or just because your childniecenephewyounger siblinget cetera dragged you into it then you're going to hate it because you've decided that you want to hate it.  That may be but to blindly trash Pokemon The 4th Movie simply because it is a Pokemon movie and especially without having seen it is just plain stupid.  Even nonfans can enjoy this movie without having to know every last detail of the world of Pokemon.  I'm not saying that you WILL become a Pokemon fan because of this movie but you CAN indeed enjoy it if you'll let yourself.Unlike the first 3 Pokemon movies Pokemon the 4th Movie is being distributed by Miramax who I've heard is also working on securing the rights to the 5th Pokemon movie which was released this past summer in Japan.  Miramax claims to have some boffoaggressive marketing strategy for Pokemon The 4th Movie but all I've seen so far is a feeble limited release which doesn't include the usual Pikachu short in the beginning which I was really looking forward to this time.  I hope that Miramax will see fit to put the Pikachu short called Pikachu's Exciting HideandSeek onto at least the DVDVHS release if not with a future wider release of Pokemon The 4th Movie.  I hope that the current release is just the tip of the iceberg for this very entertaining film.".

It is a matter of great wonder to me that others did not find the rich storylines in the film as enlightening as I did. I suppose the unfortunate reality is if a film doesn't cater to the 'lowest common denominator' its success domestically and more and more in foreign markets is questionable at best.At first I wish to address the flaws.  The animation as has been pointed out before is at best subpar.  But where they skimped on artistry in the drawings of the characters the storyboard simulated camera angles and image composition are superb.  The film lover will note the use of techniques from film auteurs such as Orsen Wells note the second part of the opening scene which is quite obviously an homage to the master or Sam Peckinpah pay close attention to scenes leading up to the first Pokemon Battle and try to tell me you aren't reminded of Straw Dogs.  I also thought the sound was pretty crummy.That aside the film was a pure masterpiece.  As in the preceding three Pokemon movies the story centers on the loveable 'Pikachu'.  Pikachu looks like an overfed mouse that can use his powers to fight other Pokemon sometimes to the death.  All Pokemon Japanese for 'The Monster who lives in the pocket' have special powers.  It has been said that Pikachu is the most powerful of all of these but to find out that one must become a 'Pokemon Master'.  As a parent I am still confused to what that really means and I suspect that in 10 years the entire lexicon of Pokemon movies and television programs will be required viewing in the more credible Psychology and Philosophy departments in Universities around the world.Countering the hero that Pikachu presents us is yet another Pokemon who is called 'Meowth' brilliantly voiced by the multitalented yet underrated Addie Blaustein.  Meowth unlike every other Pokemon can speak in English who only know and converse in Japanese.  As a side note I hope in the DVD version the English translation of the Pokemon's conversations will be provided.  Meowth travels with a hapless game of criminals called 'The Rocket Team' who battle with Pikachu and his owner Ash to become Pokemon Masters.Within these two characters lie the classic storyline of the Epic struggle between good and evil truth and deception black and white.  It is highly recommended that the casual fan revisit the entire running of the TV series in order including the surreal yet awe inspiring Jhoto Journeys and the films before returning to this work.Nine out of 10.  Near perfection in my book.".

As a side note I hope in the DVD version the English translation of the Pokemon's conversations will be provided.  Meowth travels with a hapless game of criminals called 'The Rocket Team' who battle with Pikachu and his owner Ash to become Pokemon Masters.Within these two characters lie the classic storyline of the Epic struggle between good and evil truth and deception black and white.  It is highly recommended that the casual fan revisit the entire running of the TV series in order including the surreal yet awe inspiring Jhoto Journeys and the films before returning to this work.Nine out of 10.  Near perfection in my book.";

For the more adolescent fans however many there are I am more dubious to recommend this. Pokemon 3 may have been dark but the story was imaginative and had some wisdom and emotional depth. Whereas Pokemon 3 could almost have been a family movie Pokemon 4ever is easily just a kids movie.Pokemon 4ever takes Ash and friends out of the darkness and back into sunlight. As beautiful as this fourth entry is it is also quite corny. All pokemon movies integrate a new legendary pokemon into the story. Pokemon 4ever showcases Celebi a forest spirit who is chirpy but nothing more. Celebi has about as much personality as the sugar fairies in Fantasia. She may be a pokemon but a character she is not. Equally unmemorable is the cackling antagonist who dresses like the terminator's second cousin and behaves like a shallow Disney villain.Pretty much the entire film takes place in the Johto region forest having been aired at the end of the fourth season This is a visually spectacular piece of landscape which becomes the setting for a less than spectacular storyline. Pokemon 4ever may be concise and simple in plot but not only is it rather shallow but it feels strangely rushed. Pokemon 4ever also has the kind of syrupy ending that tries to pull to emotions out of us which it has not earned. The pokemon world can offer a variety of strong story possibilities but this movie does not exploit them. This is essentially a Disney movie that has pokemon in it. My conclusion is that Pokemon 4ever is a visually strong but thinly written entry in the adventures of Ash Ketchum.".

This was made during the first real dark period of the anime where less and less quality was apparent. If there is one thing that symbolizes that time this movie is it.The plot revolves around Satoshi Ash meeting Yukinari Sam who just happens to have traveled 40 years into the future because he saved Celebi from a poacher. Now the two must protect Celebi from a masked man known only as Vicious IronMasked Marauder. Throughout the film we slowly see a friendship form between Satoshi and Yukinari that doesn't really go anywhere as well as with Celebi who does just about nothing until the middle of the film and still doesn't do much even then. Sure there are other characters but they do just about nothing for the whole film. The animation is good except for the CGI which is just awful and everywhere. The acting is just mediocre and forgettable though not awful. The soundtrack is forgettable except for the ending song which sometimes get stuck in my head. Almost everything about this film is forgettable except for the ending which is amazingly bad and stupid. The English version from what I've heard is even more stupid and confusing.

In that movie its about a couple of young people trying to save the spirit of the forest and stop humans from destroying the forest this Pokemon movie is about a bunch of kids also trying to save the spirit of the forest and stop humans from destroying the forest. Both these films have environmentalism themes that are both used subtly and very entertainingly  but i like this movie more and its less gross. This Pokemon movie was my childhood in fact i think i watched this movie before i saw the anime or the first movie with mew two. Which is really good because this movie has a intro describing the world of Pokemon narrated by the character Brock this intro is very informative endearing beautiful and will always be super nostalgic for me  i feel the tears coming. The reason this intro is very good is because it explains what Pokemon are who the characters are all in a few minutes the first Pokemon movie didn't have this and many people including the nostalgic critic  watch his video felt the first movie lacked that necessary information. Anyways the movie starts off with a kid named SAM traveling through a ancient forest he is warned by a young woman that the spirit of the forest named celebi has the power to time travel and can accidentally take people through time coincidentally he bumps into a Pokemon poacher who has just captured celebi Sam helps it escape and they then time travel to the future. In the present ash misty and Brock travel to that same forest where a city made of tree houses is. The same woman  now older warns them about the time traveling Pokemon and the boy who dissappeared 40 years ago coincidentally the boy arrives in front of them. As they try to find a way to heal the injured celebi Sam and ash become like brothers. Meanwhile there is a new villain called the iron masked marauder whose intro involves him capturing a tyranitar with a  Dark Ball which supposedly has the power to turn Pokemon evil  this is my favorite kind of poke ball it looks super bad ass! he then has the tyranitar hyper beam an entire trailer park not only does this guy look completely bad ass hes played by Yugi from YUGIOH! Anyways he wants to capture celebi for his own ends he stalks the kids through the forest with an awesome tripod making him a very intimidating villain. When he confronts them one of the best Pokemon tag team fights ensues between his sneasel and scizor and ash and Sam. Sam actually uses a vintage poke ball and uses a charmeleon. Unfortunately the villain does catch celebi with a dark ball and makes it evil and then Ash actually gets in a hands on fight with the villain  human vs human! and he gets beaten up pretty bad the villain then tells celebi to create as meowth calls it a twig monster and it then begins to destroy the forest as it heads for the city the villain goes into super evil mode by this point. Another legendary Pokemon called suicine then arrives to help with the battle and the fight is amazing! They finally make celebi good again but he starts to die! Here's where magic time travel becomes involved and you should probably watch it yourself  there's no way to describe it. The boy Sam is then returned to his time and its revealed that the boy is someone ash knows. This movie is beautiful the visuals are stunning the scene where the butter free appear its gorgeous but its not just the animation  actually the CGI could have been better the music is very emotional the atmosphere is perfect the mysticism used is quite intriguing especially as we learn of the lore of celbi and suicine. The dialogue is better than most pokemon movies ash and Sam actually have a moment talking about their moms and its very endearing the movie feels so much more than a Pokemon movie it feels impactful i still watch this movie to this day with my sisters i feel there is a little something in this movie for everyone  celebi is like disturbingly overload cute im starting to question if Pokemon was meant for boys. And for me it was like a Hayao Miyazaki film before i even watched any Hayao Miyazaki movies and it influenced me very greatly in doing my part to protect nature in anyway i can.".

The forest and the scenery in it is beautiful to look at. The CGI could have been better though.Sammy was a likable character and I liked his relationship with Ash. I hope Ash later learned that Sammy is...you know.As to be expected the final halfhour is actionpacked and full of excitement even if it doesn't quite match the CharizardEntei battle from 3.

Most of all there are plenty of adorable forest Pokmon which is lovely and the timetravelling concept is absolutely clever!Unfortunately I don't really like the 3D graphic incorporated into this film which I felt it is overly done. Overall the forest is indeed beautiful but not until a 3D monster appears which does not blend well with its surrounding. They also tried to let Ash to steal the spotlight even though this animated feature isn't about him so these are at least the two turn offs.Nonetheless Celebi Voice of the Forest 2001 is quite sweet to watch and it is interesting.

The first film had potential because the central character had dark value that threatened to actually create a strong narrative it didn't of course but it had some good moments. With this film the plot seems to be mostly about introducing a new pokmon for the fans to care about. This means that there aren't even any vague themes to interest me and the story is very much simple characters in a simple story of bad characters and good characters doing bad and good things respectively. It relies almost totally on the monsters and constant action to hold the interest and I suppose in this regard it will suit young children ho really just need colour movement and noise.The animation is reasonably good but the pocket monsters themselves are quite bland with lots of soft edges and no real threat or grit about them  the evil Celebi in its nest is the exception though as it is well done. Meanwhile the human characters are simplistic and delivered in big sweeping gestures and with voices to match.

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing the first teaser of Thale I wasn't expecting very much of this Norwegian low budget film which is a mix of the genres crime drama gore and adventure. The more I got surprised by seeing the film at the cinema. 'Thale' is based on a mythical character in Norwegian folklore called 'Huldra'. A hulder is a beautiful young woman living in water in the dark woods louring men into the water with them getting attention with their heavenly singing. This folklore came from warning kids to stay away from waters back in the ancient times. A hulder looks just like a woman except you tell it's a hulder by her tail. The film opens with some rather disgusting scenes really preparing you on something the film isn't  gory. Two crime scene washers comes to a cottage out in the deep woods. It's a long time since I've seen such a start of a film involving blood stiff body and puking. But the film soon changes more into a thriller when the two men find i cellar looking like a serial killers office. Then they discover Thale...It's easy to see that this film is low budget but there's much talent here. Silje Reinmo Thale is very good and the CGI is handled well. Norwegian folklore suits CGI great. With more work on the script this could easily have been a classic like TrollHunter. Far from perfect but I'll give a 610 for the talent and the difference. I'd like to see more on a larger budget and a more thorough script.".

After all there are only four actors in total and a voice.Even if the lead character is supposedly the one driving the story the movie being seen from his perspective the one that really made the film feel real and interesting was in acting and role his friend interpreted by Jon Sigve Skard. A phlegmatic character he underlines the weirdness of the situation by acting totally cool creating the appropriate contrast.Over all it was a nice film although the entirety of it was pretty much about the same thing and something that was already obvious from the beginning.

Made on a shoe string budget by rising Norwegian director Aleksander Nordaas the film explores the huldra a mythical being from Nordic folklore. Without giving anything away I will just say that the acting especially that of the very beautiful Silje Reinmo in the title role was excellent for such a low budget picture. The CGI and cinematography in the movie also impressed offering another breathtaking view of the Norwegian countryside. The film is let down slightly by some holes in the storyline and ultimately by the ending which I found could have been done so much better. This said Thale is an excellent example of what an imaginative director can fulfill within the confines of a small budget.".

They did really good jobs with their characters and carried the movie so well.I believe that you have to really be accustomed to Norwegian folklore and legends to really get the storyline of this movie. Without such knowledge the movie can be a little bit indifferent I suppose. And one thing that I was puzzled about was why Thale was so different from the other Hulda people in the forest. Gives you something to think about.The story in Thale is about Leo and Elvis who are out deep in the forest on a cleaning job on a very messy site when they discover a hidden entrance to a basement. They scale the stairs and find a small laboratory of sorts hidden beneath the surface. And here they also find a young beautiful naked woman in a bathtub. Leo and Elvis find themselves wrapped up in some mysterious events as they start to find out who or what Thale really is.This movie came out of nowhere and proved to be good fun to watch.

You can see the opposite chemistry in them when Elvis seems to be the more emotional soft sided type and Leo is the one more calm more tough that keeps it all together. The journey takes them to a basement where they find a woman named Thale the huldra. Despite other reviews of the movie concentrated more on misoginism i see it as this. The huldra appears first as a frail woman naked which for her seemed natural and defenceless which would be psichologically a natural state. She had just lost the one taking care of her and met with the two strangers after no contact with other humans . The storyline of the movie is pretty good but a bit lost also . The author did a great job in telling the huldra's story and why she was like she was but the narration from the tapes and of her description is actually wrong. The huldra only acted violent when threatened which was a primary instinct but in the end it only shows that she was unknowledgable to the world around her and had her own sense of right and wrong.".

She demonstrates incredible power psychic abilities and weird eating habits but there are some ruthless people after her who'll let nothing stand in their way. Alongside members of her own race who want her back...It ain't thrill a minute but the plot and performances are of sufficient quality to keep one hooked and even moving in some cases. Being short in length helps too keeping unnecessary padding at bay for the most part. Special mention must go to Silje Reinamo who not only convinces as a sympathetic extraterrestrial creature but bravely hops around starkers for half the duration.

Huldra's do have a...tail read thale and sometimes it did remind me of Splice 2009. But here it's told like a lullaby just before you go to sleep. That's maybe the only negative thing about this flick. It doesn't contain gore or real horror. It do has a few jump moments but once thale shows her ugly side it doesn't become gory or bloody even as she attacks the intruders. Even as thale Silje Reinmo walks around for 90 in her nudies it never becomes gratuitous. I guess that most of the horror buffs will mostly prefer Trollhunter but this here also do offer a few things. A happy ending for Leo and it's up to you if thale has something to do with it or not. People who know the story about huldra's will love it for others it's a rare flick.Gore 05 Nudity 35 Effects 35 Story 255 Comedy 05".

It do has a few jump moments but once thale shows her ugly side it doesn't become gory or bloody even as she attacks the intruders. Even as thale Silje Reinmo walks around for 90 in her nudies it never becomes gratuitous. I guess that most of the horror buffs will mostly prefer Trollhunter but this here also do offer a few things. A happy ending for Leo and it's up to you if thale has something to do with it or not. People who know the story about huldra's will love it for others it's a rare flick.Gore 05 Nudity 35 Effects 35 Story 255 Comedy 05";

This movie does a great job of revealing bits and pieces of the story as it goes along until you finally understand everything at the very end. The main characterfound in the basement Thale is one of a few of her kind  but she was kept away from the others by a slightlyabusive but mostly fatherly scientist in hopes of keeping her away from the scarier characteristicslike eating people of the rest of the Tailedgroup. This movie mixes many different genre's but keeps the main focus on the story when it could have become overly filled with special effects gore or sex appealwhich would have happened if it was American made. A sequel is supposedly coming in the English language with the same director and hopefully it isn't butchered by American influences. The movie focuses primarily of where Thale came from how she became who she is and where she is going in the end. A clichd side story about government coverup is the only downside to the movie but at least this is kept to a minimum. This is very similar to Species but with some different twists to the story making it unique enough to be seen. Please watch this  you will definitely be engrossed for 76 minutes. This is another foreign film that deserves more attention by Americans.".

He managed to create with a limited budget a slightly curious film that benefits a lot from the strong performances of the small but talented cast. The two main male actors Erlend Nervold and Jon Sigve Skard have to great performance but the most mesmerizing performance in this movie belongs to one of the most promising stars of nordic cinema Silje Reinmo which without speeches or many screen time was able to give her curious character a lot of energy and enigma. Unfortunately Thale it is not given much space or time to grow and shine within a median plot that apart from being practically free of active or violent sequences unfolds virtually in its entirety within a basement where Leo and Elvis try to learn more about Thale and realize what secrets and dangers hide behind this beautiful creature. The interactions between the three actors are a bit limited and at the end of the film we get the feeling that we didn't get to know very well the mysterious Thale or their violent sisters but at least we are given an good characterization of these mythological creatures that begin and end up a mystery to all of us even though the movie give us a small explanation of its origin and some glimpses of their strength and real nature. It's true that the minimalist plot of Thale doesn't stand out the full potential of the legend that is in the core of the film but it can't be said that this movie is a weak fictionfantasy product because it manages to entertain the audience and emerge us in a fantastic and tense world with some surprises. It's true that the plot should have focused a little more on Thale and should have also instilled a bit of suspense and action to this production but taking into account the limitations and the essence of the film I consider this Thale a reasonable cinematic product.".

But miles better as a fairy tale movie than Snow White and the Huntsman and more suitable for kids. Some jumps few scares but a really restrained hand directing it. She's nude but tastefully done with no nipples and the lead actress really sells the part for having literally no dialogue. Really enjoyable if a little slow as a bedtime story should be.".

Santo Carbone in Calabria in 1860 is a guerrillabandit who has captured Colonel Breviglieri of the Piedmontese army that is seeking to incorporate southern Italy into unified nation. Later he assists the Bourbon troops of Francesco as a colonel in that army. Carbone is played by Ernest Borgnine dubbed into Italian here and looking very Wild Bunchy in his demeanor. Katy Jurado plays his wife Assunta Carbone. A libidinous bandit called 'O Caporale becomes Santo's assistant...when he is not carrying on with Mariangela played by the lovely Rosanna Schiaffino. 'O Caporale is played by Vittorio Gassman as a saucy comic type speaking in his Neapolitan dialect which seems alien to Gassman's mouth. The battles are many the pace of the screen excitement never lags. In the end the banditheroes are captured by the Piedmontese. Carbone is killed by one of the land barons of the region who probably doesn't want the man's influence to continue among his captors. In short this is an engaging adventure yarn of no special depth or conviction that would have played well with general audiences. Director Mario Camerini had a career going back to the Italian silent era and this is neither his best nor his worst work. The movie did not have any kind of commercial release in the United States but was shown on television as The Italian Brigands in an Englishlanguage version which I believe used Borgnine and Jurado's own voices.".

Moving film in which there are nailbiting action scenes  intrigue  blasts  suspenseful set pieces and mediocre European stars  if not much continuity . While obviously not having the budget of 007 movies it does its best to exploit the Madrid  Paris and Istanbul scenery .

As he starred all kind of movies as Hercules Against the Barbarians  Maciste against Mongols Charada international  Operation Lady Chaplin  Desert commando  The road to Fort Alamo and Ringo of Nebraska. Sympathetic acting by Ken Clark as a type of James Bond as well as a young and adventurous seducer stunningly accompanied by the really charming women as Margaret Lee  Evi Marandi and Mikaela .

While I didn't enjoy it as much as the first in the series Mission Bloody Mary it's still a fun movie and definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of EuroSpy films. In this one Malloy is searching for a kidnapped scientist who has developed a beta ray that will instantaneously dissolve all metal. Along the way he runs into a pack of baddies intent on stopping him Russian spies and enough beautiful women to make even James Bond envious. I'll be honest  the plot doesn't really matter much. There were times as I was watching From the Orient with Fury when I couldn't remember what Malloy's ultimate mission was. But I still was having fun so who cares. Ken Clark has an easy going air about him that makes him great to watch. I'm really starting to enjoy his work. He's joined in the cast by one of my new Euro favorites Margaret Lee Evi Marandi and the everpresent Franco Ressel. It seems sometimes that I run into Ressel in just about every Italian movie I watch. Terrific location shots from Paris to Madrid to Istanbul add to the overall feel of the film. If I had to point to one weakness that keeps me from rating From the Orient with Fury as high as its predecessor it would be the repetitive nature of some of the fight scenes. I think Malloy runs into and fights the same four or five henchmen at least a eight or nine times. It does tend to get a bit old. Otherwise I've got few real complaints. I'll give this one a 610 upon my initial viewing.".

Ken Clark acquits himself well in the role of the twofisted CIA agent who must rescue a scientist from the villains. The scientist Professor Frank Kurtz has perfected a beta ray gun that can disintegrate any metal. The action shifts from Paris to Madrid to Instanbul as Maloy and Kurtz's daughter try to find him. Franco Ressell makes an excellent villain who abducts the professor and tries to throw the CIA off the trail by staging the professor's death.

The scientist Professor Frank Kurtz has perfected a beta ray gun that can disintegrate any metal. The action shifts from Paris to Madrid to Instanbul as Maloy and Kurtz's daughter try to find him. Franco Ressell makes an excellent villain who abducts the professor and tries to throw the CIA off the trail by staging the professor's death. Despite a healthy looking budget From the Orient With Fury isn't as furious as it could have been.";

Rocky V is one such film that is affected by the  as I call it  Phantom Menace syndrome. This refers to Movies that are interesting in their own way but fail to live up to the hype or expectation of previous instalments or simply do not follow the formula that everyone derided for being too predictable anyway. For me Rocky V is the best of the sequels to the 1976 original as it does not follow in the Rocky tradition of simply having a bigger guy to fight than in the previous film. Rocky IV was a great spectacle but it was more comical than anything to think that an entire Russian government could be funding one oversized boxer who could kill a man with one flurry of punches not to mention turn a blind eye to illegal doping. The fifth instalment in the anthology goes back to the more personal story of the character and deals much more realistically with the aftermath of loss and the twisted nature of professional prize fighting.Stallone recruited his own son for the role of Robert Rocky's son and the result is one of the best father son relationships ever committed to celluloid. The scene where Rocky realises that he has been a negligent father and must make his peace with the boy is affectionate and heartfelt and could never been as realistic without the real life history behind these two people.OK there are some flaws and I am not too naive to suggest this movie is worthy of an Oscar. The casting of Tommy 'The Machine' Gunn could have been better as real life boxer Tommy Morrison sometimes appears wooden and is never really threatening enough to Rocky for the final fight to have any tangible tension. Similarly aside from the final tune of Elton John's 'The measure of a man' the music does not measure up to the awesome and inspirational anthems that have accompanied previous instalments. Any Flick in the early nineties that used rap music as its primary soundtrack has ultimately dated for a modern audience.My advice would be to watch this movie in full before you judge it. There are some sad moments in this fall from grace story as well as few goofs in terms of weak acting. But it's not as bad as people say and as the sixth instalment nears completion it's about time everyone got back into the Rocky spirit for one more round.A good film. 710".

In Rocky V Rocky Balboa is faced with such a scenario. This movie proves to me that you need to have more than one string to your arrow as you never know when it might come in handy one day. Rocky V also points out that money and possession are not the important things in life but family and true friends are!Losing it all does not mean a thing unless you've got something to lose And Rocky Balboa had it all. Times have changed though for former Heavyweight champion of the world. A lifetime of fighting has taken its toll mentally and physically and the maneuverings of an scrupulous accountant have left him financially strapped. But resiliency and the ability to come back have been trademarks of the Rocky legend. Just when it looks like the champ is down for the count he discovers the raw talent of a young fighter named Tommy Gunn who just might be Rocky's last chance for glory. In a world where achievement is marked by dollars and cents and in a profession where success is measured in wins and losses Rocky Balboa knows that whatever the struggle your only hope is to give it your best shot.This film is probably the weakest of the five films in the Rocky series. Yet there are some very good parts to it. The way we see Rocky get over bankruptcy was very good as is the way he eventually makes his family the most important thing in his life. Again I found this story to be good though I guess it lacked that real Rocky feel to it mainly because the champ was unwilling or unable to get into the ring. Stallone has done a grand job in being the writer of all the Rocky films. The cast make a final appearance that is reasonably good. Stallone is good as Rocky once again. His character is still trying to make a contribution to fighting after being told that he can no longer professionally fight in the ring. So he helps out fresh talent Tommy Machine' Gunn who is acted by real life boxer Tommy Morrison. I found this character to be just far to arrogant and stubborn which in a way did not suit being a part of the Balboa corner. Tommy has had an interesting life not only fighting wise but in a personal way. He has been caught in drug rackets drink driving and admitted to the world that he has contracted the fatal HIV virus. I am not so sure he is the greatest of actors though.The normal cast members were good. Talia Shire's character Adrian lets the world know that her husband is finished boxing and has nothing else to prove in the boxing ring. Making a special appearance was star from the first three films that of Burgess Meredith. Just seeing him onscreen was really satisfying. Mickey was a favourite character of mine. I must mention that I liked seeing Stallone's very own son Sage in Rocky as Rocky's son Rocky Jnr. He was pretty good as the son that felt left out in the cold. He also has a mean punch like the old man as well. I found that all the Rocky films had terrific soundtracks. This is due to the great work by composer Bill Conti. Bill has done a wonderful job in organising the music to go with all the fighting scenes and the poignant scenes which require that tune to set them off just nicely. Rocky five had probably the best song on any of the soundtracks that being the Elton John hit Measure of a man'. I think it is a wonderful song with some terrific lyrics. I have loved most of the music that the Rocky movies have given us.Rocky V might not be the best movie ever made but it certainly had some sort of impact on me. I believe if a movie only makes a slight impression on you then it has achieved in a small way what it was meant to do. I heard that plans for Rocky VI were being made with a script finished by Stallone just a few years ago. Personally I feel that if it was to be made it would not be that great a film because Balboa can no longer make a comeback in the ring and if he does he could well become  as his wife said disabled'. All things being said these films are a terrific avenue of motivation and can help any person get the spark back to turn their luck around in any venture they pursue.Rating 3 Stars or 6.510".

So he helps out fresh talent Tommy Machine' Gunn who is acted by real life boxer Tommy Morrison. I found this character to be just far to arrogant and stubborn which in a way did not suit being a part of the Balboa corner. Tommy has had an interesting life not only fighting wise but in a personal way. He has been caught in drug rackets drink driving and admitted to the world that he has contracted the fatal HIV virus. I am not so sure he is the greatest of actors though.The normal cast members were good. Talia Shire's character Adrian lets the world know that her husband is finished boxing and has nothing else to prove in the boxing ring. Making a special appearance was star from the first three films that of Burgess Meredith. Just seeing him onscreen was really satisfying. Mickey was a favourite character of mine. I must mention that I liked seeing Stallone's very own son Sage in Rocky as Rocky's son Rocky Jnr. He was pretty good as the son that felt left out in the cold. He also has a mean punch like the old man as well. I found that all the Rocky films had terrific soundtracks. This is due to the great work by composer Bill Conti. Bill has done a wonderful job in organising the music to go with all the fighting scenes and the poignant scenes which require that tune to set them off just nicely. Rocky five had probably the best song on any of the soundtracks that being the Elton John hit Measure of a man'. I think it is a wonderful song with some terrific lyrics. I have loved most of the music that the Rocky movies have given us.Rocky V might not be the best movie ever made but it certainly had some sort of impact on me. I believe if a movie only makes a slight impression on you then it has achieved in a small way what it was meant to do. I heard that plans for Rocky VI were being made with a script finished by Stallone just a few years ago. Personally I feel that if it was to be made it would not be that great a film because Balboa can no longer make a comeback in the ring and if he does he could well become  as his wife said disabled'. All things being said these films are a terrific avenue of motivation and can help any person get the spark back to turn their luck around in any venture they pursue.Rating 3 Stars or 6.510";

But the wonderful thing is it isn't drawn out with boring scenes of bonding and what not. This movie made me more angry than Rocky IV even. I won't say why for that would just ruin the fun part. This movie stays realistic to the character of Rocky but this time it is more about his relationship not with himself but with the people around him. This movie is fun.810.".

	schema:headline " Rocky V terribly underrated";
	schema:reviewBody "I have rated this movie as a 10 which will make most readers think I don't have a clue what I'm talking about. To be honest I don't believe this movie is a 10 but I feel I need to give it that bit extra due to the very low rating this movie has polled on this site. Even though it will make next to no difference to the overall rating of the movie it will at least make me feel a little better. I have watched the rocky series probably 100 times each and if I had anything to do with making them I would feel offended that Rocky V is rated lower than Rockys III and IV. I feel that going on best to worst the order should be The original on top followed by the second then the fifth then the third with number 4 coming in last. The original Rocky is one of the best movies ever made no question. By the second film Stallone took over directing duties and done a decent job with it apart from one or two corny things thrown in to it. By the third one however all common sense in the series went out the window right from the opening montage. The fourth Rocky should have been titled Rocky 80's. If anyone over the age of 12 truly loves that movie you should be ashamed of yourself. The first movie wasn't a sports movie it was a drama which happened to be about a journeyman boxer getting to live his dream by fighting for a heavyweight championship. Rocky IV is just a big stupid fight scene with the rest of the movie just filling in time. Why would Rocky turn down his prize money for this fight? Yes he was doing it to avenge his friends death but why not avenge Apollo and make 10 million at the same time which he could at least give to a charity? The training sequence is stupid why would there be any gyms at all if running up a mountain was better than all the best equipment available mixed with steroids. The fight scene itself which was really all they had was obscenely ridiculous. There isn't a referee in the world that wouldn't have stopped the contest 3 rounds in. Rocky gets dropped a good 10 times that fight but keeps getting up yet when he drops Drago once the show is over. He somehow gets an entire nation to change from spitting on him at the start to loving him all in under 30 minutes and all by punching there national hero in the head. And don't get me started on the speech he gives in the middle of the ring at the end I'm cringing just thinking about it. The reason Rocky 5 is not so popular is that people were looking for a sequel to Rocky 4 not another sequel to Rocky 1. Number 5 breaks away from the 80's crap brought to us by the previous 2 sequels. It goes back to its roots of a real story and they brought the original director back for it. This again has made a drama set in the world of boxing rather than just a 'boxing movie'. And for people who are just after the action it actually has more boxing scenes than the other movies its just Tommy Gunn for most of it instead of the title character who by the way was played by Tommy Morrison who went on to win the World Heavyweight title in real life. The script is solid the characters have depth and it underlines the corruption that is ruining the sport of boxing. If you really are a fan of either film or boxing rent the movie again and tell me i'm wrong".

Rocky Balboa is hands down one of my favorite fictional heroes. He's likable funny strong full of integrity. I really wanted to like this movie. It has problems though serious problems. First the guy loses everything? All the money is gone and he's back on the street? That was a little hard to swallow. Next he decided to train some stalker and mold him into his own image to the detriment of his relationship with his only son? It was a little hard to grasp but I did see where he was going with that. Rocky knew he couldn't or shouldn't fight anymore so he lives vicariously and by extension through Tommy Gunn with Rocky assuming himself as a young Mickey in the making. It was alluring to the exclusion of all else. But what I did find very appealing about this movie was the running commentary about the dark side of professional boxing. There was a reason he included a Don Kingish promoter to personify all that is seedy and wrong with the sport. You wanted to kill this guy by the end.What saves this film is the street fight at the end. I don't think it was the best fight scene of the Rockys but it was damn good and damn intense. Rocky is almost out and we see flashbacks of his earlier defeats as the birdies circle his battered head.

Other rich and arrogant fighters would probably be bothered by not living the wealthy lifestyle but Balboa is not.He goes back to live in his old neighborhood with Adrian Talia Shire and his son played by real life son Sage StalloneBalboa starts to train Tommy Gunn  a young fighter on the risewho is played by Tommy Morrison.Gunn has talent but he can't focus enough to use it which parallels the life of Tommy Morrison himself.Morrison at one time was a good fighter but he was arrogant cocky and lazy at times.Everytime he got a good chance to be a champion he would show a poor performance.Morrison retired after receiving the aids virus I believe.A greedy fight promother named George Washington who resembles Don King wants Balbao to get back in the ring.He promises Balbao a big contract but Balbao refuses already knowing the slimeball his dealing with.So Washington lures Tommy Gunn into fighting for him but Gunn can't escape the shadow of Balbao.In a good scene Washington shows what an ugly character he is by manipulating Gunn into fighting Balbao.Gunn confronts Balbao and we see both guys beat up each other to see whose number 1.Rocky 5 is more intense than the horrible Rocky 4 movie and has better acting.In another scene Balbao starts having Flashbacks to his glory years with his manager Micki Burgess Meredith  it's a very sentimental moment.In another scene I like is when Adrian talks to Rocky about how much she loves him and how no matter tough things get she will always stick by him.In a way Adrian Talia Shire represents the most important thing a man wants in a woman.That is a woman who loves a man for the person he is and not by the superficial material things the man can give her.That's my kind of lady.So as you can see there are many good points in Rocky 5 good acting and good action mixed in with many sentimental moments.".

I wish other films can have as great a fight scene as the one in this one. The cool part is Tommy Gun is Tommy Morrison a real life boxer. I only wish I can see Rocky slug it out with another fighter like Mike Tyson or even fight The Rock.This isn't the best Rocky but it's a very good movie. I still recognize it as being part of the series. All of the true Rocky fans should. My only problems are that the movie is too contemporary Rocky has brain damage and how it keeps showing flash backs of the Drago fight. Rocky proved in Rocky IV that Drago was just a man and in this they take it back. It's like Drago is haunting him. Also how everyone looks too old especially Talia Shire. And how the hell did the son grow so fast. I'm sure Rocky wasn't in Russia for years and why was Duke out of the movie so fast. He's a great character. In the end it shows photos from the previous Rocky movies to I guess say it's over. Please Sly. Make another Rocky. End the series with another great Rocky movie. Don't end the series yet.".

He will find a new opportunity  to regret to the top of the glory but this is not simple. He must run in the street's again. In this movie the American people always love him its a national hero and it's not easy for a hero try to retire and go home.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm absolutely amazed at the awful reviews people have given this film. I thought it was great!! Ok I did have the advantage of seeing it on tv last night just after Van Damme's DREADFUL A.W.O.L but i still reckon Rocky 5 is a gem of a movie. Forget his voice which CAN be irritating at times Sylvester Stallone has the sharpest mind in Hollywood and he's highly accomplished in every field of moviemaking. Boxers are the roughest and toughest of people but they're still human with the same feelings and vulnerabilities as everyone else  I think Stallone deserves MEGA respect for the compassion and understanding which shines through all 5 of the Rocky series. I don't think there's an emotion or a situation a boxer could face that Sly hasn't covered  and covered convincingly. The problem this film has always faced is that it appeals to a different more thoughtful audience than the first 4. It's much more of a 'drama' than an 'action' movie. Take it as it is and dramas don't come much better. The 'sugary' scenes between Rocky  his son are always particularly savaged in listings magazines. But what do they know! I found them genuinely touching. Here's a guy with a limited intellect desperately trying to reach out to his son and not really knowing how to express himself. Stallone CAN act! Talia Shire was electrifying  Richard Gant deliciously horrible as the thinly disguised Don King. Touch me  I'll sue! I remember seeing Rocky 4 at the cinema in 1986. At the time it seemed wonderful but all these years later the isn't America wonderful theme has aged badly and the flagdraped ending is just embarrassing. Rocky 5 hasn't aged a bit and remember Stallone was FORTY FOUR when 5 was made. He looked pretty damn good. The fight sequence near the end is as good as anything in the first 4. Yes! People were standing up in the theatre and yelling every bit as much as a real fight and this wasn't even in the ring. I always remember the muffled roar of the audience when Stallone looks to camera just for a couple of seconds and we all knew Tommy Gunn was finally going to get his arse kicked. Sheer entertainment. I've heard Stallone is fond of saying to newcomers Forget the art. It's a business.  Maybe it's because he thinks like that that he produces such wonderful art. For me Rocky 5 has to be 8 out of 10.".

How on earth is Rocky supposed to come out unscathed?? Stallone was going for realism irreversible brain damage. He got dumber than he was in part 1.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Ultraman Mebius  Ultraman Brothers";
	schema:reviewBody "I grew up watching Ultraman on television so much so that back then I can sing the theme song in Japanese of course not knowing exactly what it meant! With so many variations on the Ultra heroes it's actually quite easy for a kid to follow with each episode having a different ugly monster wreck havoc on Earth ok make that Japan and each time Ultra whoever will transform himself do battle through his kungfu moves until that red light on his chest blinks as an indication to stop monkeying around and then he finishes the monster with his signature moves.Ah nostalgia! But what I did like about Ultraman was indeed the intricate modelling done on the landscapes of Japan and how they get so painfully destroyed by the monster imitating Gojira or when our hero is on the receiving end of a smackdown to the ground. And the special effects though so dated today were really captivating to a kid those days. I have many fond memories of my collection of Ultraman figurines which somehow mysteriously disappeared after cousins came visiting one afternoon many years back. Over the years especially after television stopped airing updated episodes Ultraman faded but always had a special place inside my heart.There were the new versions of late what with Ultraman Tiga Dyna and what have yous. I found their design to be unUltraman like especially with their shades of blue. Watching some episodes didn't trigger my interest so I did not pick up from where I left off. However in celebration of 40 years since the creation of the very first Ultraman a new movie only released in disc format here was spotted on the shelves that of a certain Ultraman Mebius. While I thought his colour scheme was right and the new kid on the block very nicely designed and pleasing to the eye what caught my interest was the words Ultraman Brothers and in the same cover you see the heroes of old including Ultraman Ultraman Jack Ultraseven and Ultraman Ace together with Ultraman Taro and Ultraman Zoffy. Wow! But the barebones DVD coupled with its unattractive price put me off for a bit until I saw a preview of it being shown on the television of an electronics shop.And I was sold!I bought the DVD and rarely do I pop it into the player immediately I still have stacks of DVDs unwatched but I did for this one. And I loved it tremendously nevermind the kiddish plot and central theme of the power of confidence can give you courage kinda fortune cookie sayings.For the uninitiated as if I was an expert Yi Lai is in the GUYS formation one of those world wide policemen with snazzy equipment and vehicles to combat monsters that invade earth but almost without a doubt never using such firepower given the presence of Ultraman. Yi Lai is Ultraman Mebius and when called upon he has this transformation device attached to his wrist to being him up to size. Mebius is quite athletic and has a range of powers which this movie will introduce you to coupled with a streak of green in his level of experience. After all Mebius had selected to come to earth because he wanted to find out whatever happened to his brothers Ultraman Jack Ace and Seven.The quartet had been living a life of seclusion of sorts in their human form sacrificing their ability to transform in order to imprison a vicious monster. And you know what the best part is? The filmmakers got the ORIGINAL human actors to portray their aged counterparts and fused some montage shots from their resp ective series of yesteryears! You just cannot get any more cooler or more authentic than that! Pure nostalgia flowing I tell you! And this lends some weight when the quartet had to counsel Yi Lai and dispense some tips and tricks to our new rookie protector of earth  we've been there and done that!Not to spoil the story which isn't much anyway the action sequences are to die for. Fans will recognize our respective heroes' signature killer moves and after 40 years CGI has crept into the movie in the depiction of our heroes' battles against the monsters but that is not to say it's forgetting its maninarubbersuit heritage. You get the best of both worlds combined with closeups and more physical stunts done by stuntmen and the more fantastical in flight action rendered through computer graphics. It's pure eyecandy and one which you're definite to watch on repeat!This is a recommended must watch for all Ultraman fans out there and I'm already eyeing the original series boxset which is currently still priced beyond my reach. Tears will flow when I watch those episodes I tell you! And Mebius does seem interesting enough for me to want to follow his exploits. So if anyone out there wanna get my a gift for whatever occasion you probably know what to get me now don't you? P".

	schema:headline " Great Popcorn Movie for Kids and Fanboys";
	schema:reviewBody "Konaka Kazuya's fanboy film Ultraman Mebius and Ultrabrothers reminds me a lot of the Star Trek movies of the 80's especially Wrath of Khan and Voyage Home. It's a nostalgic fun movie that is primarily made for the benefit of fans of Tsuburaya Production's landmark Ultraman series of the late 60s as well as its subsequent sequels Ultra Seven Return of Ultraman Ultraman Ace and Ultraman Taro. Unlike the recent Ultraman The Next and Kamen Rider The First which both attempted to reinterpret and reinvent classic heroes of the 70s for a newer generation unfamiliar with the original series Ultraman Mebius and Ultraman Brothers embraces the past and makes these original heroes cool again.The story is simple and straightforward enough. A cadre of past Ultraman foes have joined forces to resurrect one of their own  the evil Alien Yapool who had taken control of the monstrous UKiller Ultra Killer Zarus. UKiller Zarus an original movie creation was one of the last super kaijyu's monsters the Ultra Brothers defeated many years prior. In fact the Ultra Brothers Ultraman Seven Ace and Jack sacrificed part of their cosmic powers to defeat the abomination sealing it in the waters off of Kobe Japan.As a result the Ultra Brothers have happily and quietly retired into normal human society. Flash forward to the present where current Ultra Hero Mirai Hibino AKA Ultraman Mebius  whose series is currently airing on Japanese TV travels to Kobe to investigate an evil presence that has surrounded the area. During the course of his investigation he is confronted by the alien invaders. Hibino is overwhelmed by their combined forces. The Ultra Brothers band together one last time to save Ultraman Mebius and defeat the resurrected Yapool and UKiller Zarus who have since been powered up considerably.The alien gundan army assembled to battle the Ultra Brothers seems like a dream team of classic intergalactic foes including Alien Temporer foe of Ultra Taro Alien Guts foe of Ultra Seven Alien Zarab foe of Ultraman and Alien Nackle foe of Ultraman Jack. While I wished that perennial Ultraman foe Baltan and some of the more exotic alien foes of the past like Mefilas King Joe or Metron were included the foes that did appear were quite good as villains.The appearance of Zoffy and Ultraman Taro seemed a bit like a deus ex machina contrivance in order to make an excuse for saving and powering up the Ultra Brothers. Fans of Ultraman Leo who may have felt disappointed by his exclusion in the movie can take some comfort in the fact that he figures prominently in the Ultraman Mebius TV series.While some of the CGI effects seemed almost like the CGI animation you would see in Banpresto video games like the recent Ultraman Fighting Evolution they were nonetheless exciting to watch and really helped to make the action sequences standout. It was kind of refreshing to see the Ultrman heroes actually flying in realistic CGI rather than what has been portrayed in the past miniture figures seemingly dragged along by invisible wires. The final battle in particular was amazing and really impressive.While the target audience is clearly kids the movie is surprisingly entertaining enough for adults especially those who have grown up with these heroes.Ultraman Mebius and Ultra Brothers is not a perfect movie but is engaging enjoyable entertainment best enjoyed by fans of the original series. As a 40th Anniversary film the film is a worthy tribute to these wonderful Tokusatsu live action SciFi heroes of my youth.".

The Ultra Brothers band together one last time to save Ultraman Mebius and defeat the resurrected Yapool and UKiller Zarus who have since been powered up considerably.The alien gundan army assembled to battle the Ultra Brothers seems like a dream team of classic intergalactic foes including Alien Temporer foe of Ultra Taro Alien Guts foe of Ultra Seven Alien Zarab foe of Ultraman and Alien Nackle foe of Ultraman Jack. While I wished that perennial Ultraman foe Baltan and some of the more exotic alien foes of the past like Mefilas King Joe or Metron were included the foes that did appear were quite good as villains.The appearance of Zoffy and Ultraman Taro seemed a bit like a deus ex machina contrivance in order to make an excuse for saving and powering up the Ultra Brothers. Fans of Ultraman Leo who may have felt disappointed by his exclusion in the movie can take some comfort in the fact that he figures prominently in the Ultraman Mebius TV series.While some of the CGI effects seemed almost like the CGI animation you would see in Banpresto video games like the recent Ultraman Fighting Evolution they were nonetheless exciting to watch and really helped to make the action sequences standout. It was kind of refreshing to see the Ultrman heroes actually flying in realistic CGI rather than what has been portrayed in the past miniture figures seemingly dragged along by invisible wires. The final battle in particular was amazing and really impressive.While the target audience is clearly kids the movie is surprisingly entertaining enough for adults especially those who have grown up with these heroes.Ultraman Mebius and Ultra Brothers is not a perfect movie but is engaging enjoyable entertainment best enjoyed by fans of the original series. As a 40th Anniversary film the film is a worthy tribute to these wonderful Tokusatsu live action SciFi heroes of my youth.";

Not being up on German accents this gives the film a uniformity that one suspects might be missing in the original English language version The second point was I had no knowledge whatsoever as to what I expecting . I had vaguely heard on the 13th Century children's crusade that apparently ended in complete disaster but most historians consider this crusade to be a complete work of fiction . I had of course heard of Andrzej Wajda and KANAL remains one of my favourite pieces of European cinema but being a Pole one might prejudge Wajda of being someone who's going to take a genuine ecclesiastical and portray it as historical and spiritual fact . If nothing else it's a warning to never prejudge anyone or anything because this isn't what takes place Bare in mind this is a totally unknown film . As an IMDb junkie I'd never heard of it and to my knowledge it's never been broadcast on British network television and long before the end titles appear you know why this is . At the centre of the story is a pederast Count Ludovic who has been manipulating two of the key characters to his own ends  namely to satisfy his own sexual desires . We don't get any explicit scenes of child rape but even so it does make for a rather disturbing film which even for 1968 when the Hays Code was becoming increasingly redundant sail very close to the wind At the heart of the story is a subtext that everyone should be aware of false prophets of whatever philosophical persuasion . Some people will of course view this film as a critique of religion  that all religions are based on myth and legends and this is a film for secular humanists . Indeed it is but one can also view it as a critique on the secular religion of communism where humanity's faith on a doctrine that conditions the concept of greed out of human beings is no less true that a Bronze Age Palestinian Jew being crucified for our sins is . It's notable that two apes follow he Crusade on its travels and perhaps the point is that only human evolution can save humanity for itself".

	schema:headline " 13th century Christian Children's Crusade as a hormonal teen road trip";
	schema:reviewBody "I've long been fascinated by the socalled Children's Crusade historically described as peaceful march to Jerusalem launched around the year 1212 by a charismatic teen Christian who traveled from town to town in medieval France and Germany recruiting young people to accompany him to the site of Jesus' grave because God told me to.Polish writer Jerzy Andrzejewski wrote a 1960 novel about the Children's Crusade which was adapted as the screenplay for 1968's La Croisade Maudite aka Gates to Paradise.Directed by Polish auteur Andrzej Wajda the obscure gem unfolds as a sort of 13th century Road Trip with youthful hormones and selfish impatience trumping nearly all of the supposedly pious preoccupations of their handsome leader Jacques blonde heartthrob John Fordyce constantly and comically running his fingers through his Beatlesque moptop.What makes the storytelling so intriguing is how each of the main characters tells their own tale in the form of frequently alarming confessions to the one adult accompanying the children a former Crusader turned monk who seeks to atone for the many murderous since he committed while still a knight.The monk is portrayed by Lionel Stander who'd later play Max on the TV show Hart to Hart here resembling an unfortunate amalgam of Yogi Berra and Buddy Hackett.Thusly we end up seeing the same events through several different POVS each slightly askew from the others ala Rashomon.In one notable case the biographical story told to the monk by the somewhat devious beauty Blanche egged on by her apparent boyfriend Alexander differs radically from the more truthful account that we get to see in her private thoughts and recollections.Blanche is portrayed by the almost impossibly beautiful Pauline Challoner best known for the vintage Titanic drama A Night to Remember and the highly regarded and epically ahead of its time 1969 Spanish horror classic La Residencia aka The House That Screamed said to be Dario Argento's main inspirations for Suspiria.Blanche seems to be the one teen who holds all the pieces of the puzzle that led to the beginning of the Children's Crusade.However only after several more accounts are unfolded via the recollections and confessions of the other children closest to Jacques does it become clear what REALLY sparked and drives the epic march on Jerusalem.Among the cast is young Jenny Agutter Logan's Run shortly before she was hired by Nicolas Roeg to star in the woefully obscure lostintheAustralianoutback epic Walkabout 1971.As the supposedly devout and pious young maiden Maud she pours her heart out to the audience while hanging from a tree oddly presaging a similar scene in Walkabout revealing that she's in love with the kids' charismatic leader Jacques  as is just about everyone else at the front of the parade males and females alike includingespecially Blanche's sexually omnivorous boytoy Alexander Mathieu Carrire.Is Maud's obsession with Jacques and her determination to always march at his side the only reason she's on this pilgrimage? What about Blanche's and Alexander's likeminded libidos? Or have they too been called upon by God to free Jerusalem? The latter notion seems backed up by the fact that none of the kids were willing to follow Jacques until MAUD spoke up and defended his vision in a passionate lifechanging speech that we can only see not hear with powerfully persuasive words that  for some unexplained reason divine intervention?  not a single child can remember.Agutter is most prominently featured in the first half hour of the film though she's instantly upstaged within her own flashback when Pauline Challoner's flirtatious character Blanche skips into the frame and announces her intent to make love to the reclusive and handsome shepherd Jacques the libidinous goal of just about everyone other than the adult monk who becomes increasingly horrified by the ungodly hormones raging all around him as the march progresses.Challoner would play a similarly rebellious teen the following year The House That Screamed continuing an intriguing body of work that dates back to playing a somewhat Carrielike killer kiddie in a 1961 episode of the TV thriller One Step Beyond called The Tiger.Stunningly beautiful imagine a younger and even more lovely Brigitte Bardot or perhaps Ewa Aulin from the 1968 Ringo Starr film Candy only with actual acting chops the British actress would make around two dozen films before retiring in the mid'70s despite winning several acting awards and earning herself a devotional cult of admirers.Challoner goes through the most far reaching character arc of the film eventually revealing herself to be a pretty decent if typically amorous and confused teen. She's even seen comforting her onetime romantic rival Maud as inclement weather beats down on the presumably tired and hungry horde as well as helping Maud climb a particularly daunting rocky hilltop.The only other adult among the major players is seen only in disturbing but revealing flashbacks the manipulative and predatory Count Ferdy Mayne later cast by Roman Polanski as Krolock in Dance of the Vampires.Director Andrzej Wajda an honorary Oscar winner is probably best known for his war movie trilogy  A Generation 1954 Kana 1956 and Ashes and Diamonds 1958  and for The Maids of Wilko which in 1979 was nominated for an Academy Award.If I've piqued your curiosity about this obscure cinematic gem be warned that the subject matter becomes increasingly mature  some might even say sordid  in ways I tried to avoid mentioning so as not to incur more spoiler alerts.Though starring and ostensibly about children Gates of Paradise is definitely NOT a children's film.".

The photography was breathtaking.  I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed every single frame would stand on its own.  And the acting?  Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has boxoffice appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist Neo to a T the way Reeves did.

	schema:reviewBody "Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001 a Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a groundbreaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the sciencefiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great scifi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film has a well defined arc and a purpose and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements the zooms the slow motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects pioneered the bullettime effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career. In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking innovative inventive pioneering influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.".

	schema:headline " Immensely entertaining intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!";
	schema:reviewBody "Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later and after having seen the film a few times more that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character Neo or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix and the sequels. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. CarrieAnne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character Cypher to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving however in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger sense of dread hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor mostly in the sequels. Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later my God has it already been 6 years? the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name Neo  one as in The One but also hidden in his other name Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning man and combine this with the second part of his last name son and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination son of man which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him and I quote You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ. It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism Gnosticism Gnosis  knowledge but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great or The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of scifi and people who like philosophy.1010  on my top 3 of best films.".

I was so blown away by that film I feared  and probably rightly so  that I hadn't caught every detail of what I'd just seen. I later found out that many of my friends had had a similar reaction to the film and I know virtually no one who liked the film and didn't watch it at least twice. It's simply one of those rare films that are so rich you just have to watch them several times.In structure style and concept 'The Matrix' was groundbreaking it marked the first time the visual style of Manga comic books and Anime such as 'Akira' or 'Ghost in the Shell' had been successfully translated to a liveaction film. Apart from 'Blade Runner' which has a totally different mood and pace but is also a masterpiece and visionary filmmaking there simply hadn't been anything even remotely like it. The jawdropping action sequences have such a raw gripping energy they feel like an adrenalin overdose but unlike most action films they never overshadow the story on the contrary  they enhance it and make complete sense within that universe.As for the story itself I think this is one of the most original fascinating SciFi tales you'll likely ever see on screen. Clearly inspired by Japanese Anime and Manga yet also by authors like Isaac Asimov or Philip K. Dick the story about humanity's war against its own creation machines of an artificial intelligence that have evolved to the point where they have become the dominant 'species' and vastly superior to their creators could take place in the same world as 'Blade Runner' or 'The Terminator'  albeit several hundred years later. But there is also a mythical even religious undercurrent to the story the themes of a prophecy a liberator or even a messiah make 'The Matrix' transcend the ScienceFiction genre and become even more unique.'The Matrix' was a watershed moment in filmmaking  in every respect  and even though two inferior sequels have left a bit of a stain on the film they can't distract from what an uncompromising and hugely influential masterpiece this is.

Just try it if you haven't seen the movie before.  Watch one of the fight scenes.  Then watch the whole movie.  There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes sure they're great as standalones but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters.  Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE.

	schema:headline " The Matrix Is one of the best Classic SciFi Action Film ever";
	schema:reviewBody "My review of the best epic Science Fiction Action film The Matrix 1999 starring Keanu Reeves Laurence Fishburne CarrieAnne Moss Hugo Weaving Joe Pantoliano Marcus Chong and Gloria Foster.This was be the first movie I went to see in the movie theater with my mom when I was 15.years old when I read in the magazines about The Matrix I was blown away and I wanted to see it right away. The Matrix is the best action scifi films that Keanu Reeves made in the 90's. It is one of my personal favorite movies. The Matrix is a 1999 American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis starring Keanu Reeves Laurence Fishburne CarrieAnne Moss Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called the Matrix created by sentient machines to subdue the human population while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer Neo learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines which involves other people who have been freed from the dream world.Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers this classic scifi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence and that of all mankind is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this  The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and CarrieAnneMoss Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix he can control bend and manipulate spacetime... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen. The slowmotion bullettime effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think makes you gasp and makes totally forget where the 136minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels and dozens of copycats. The Matrix Visually revolutionary and mindblowing. Keanu Reeves plays the main character Neo or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. CarrieAnne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character Cypher to life. He also played the roles in Underrated Daredevil 2003and Bad Boys I  II. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving however in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger sense of dread hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor. Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopia atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 16 years later my God has it already been 16 years? the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The film also won 4 Academy Awards including for best visual effects. 1010 for one of the best epic American science fiction action film's in the history movies like this and Aliens 1986 don't exist anymore. It is one of my personal favorite movies it is the movie I saw with my mom in the movie theater it is memories on my mom who is no longer with us anymore and I miss he.".

	onyx:emotionText "My review of the best epic Science Fiction Action film The Matrix 1999 starring Keanu Reeves Laurence Fishburne CarrieAnne Moss Hugo Weaving Joe Pantoliano Marcus Chong and Gloria Foster.This was be the first movie I went to see in the movie theater with my mom when I was 15.years old when I read in the magazines about The Matrix I was blown away and I wanted to see it right away. The Matrix is the best action scifi films that Keanu Reeves made in the 90's. It is one of my personal favorite movies. The Matrix is a 1999 American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis starring Keanu Reeves Laurence Fishburne CarrieAnne Moss Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called the Matrix created by sentient machines to subdue the human population while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer Neo learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines which involves other people who have been freed from the dream world.Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers this classic scifi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence and that of all mankind is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this  The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and CarrieAnneMoss Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix he can control bend and manipulate spacetime... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen. The slowmotion bullettime effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think makes you gasp and makes totally forget where the 136minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels and dozens of copycats. The Matrix Visually revolutionary and mindblowing. Keanu Reeves plays the main character Neo or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix.

Just watch his mouth  the way he speaks the tone and pitch of his voice his pronunciation even the pauses he makes while speaking have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond big lipped big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.A few more questions pop up in one's mind. Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines? What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?The acting's just amazing all of them no exceptions.

But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it and believe me I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy I decided to give it a try. At first although I really loved the fights graphics and characters the plot confused me. Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know By the second time I watched it I really understood it which made the movie even more enjoyable.I really loved this movie. Just about every character good or bad is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne Morpheus and CarrieAnne Moss Trinity. Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots that we created of course in order for them to get power. Not only that but he finds out that he is one who is according to prophecy going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does so you can really relate to his character.My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.".

Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know By the second time I watched it I really understood it which made the movie even more enjoyable.I really loved this movie. Just about every character good or bad is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne Morpheus and CarrieAnne Moss Trinity. Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots that we created of course in order for them to get power. Not only that but he finds out that he is one who is according to prophecy going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does so you can really relate to his character.My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.";

The irony is that nobody cares about his death instead his children  neighbours are more interested in their materialistic needs. One early morning in Delhi Khosla wakes up and plans to go to the site where he has purchased a plot to build his house. He is accompanied by his wife eldest son Bunty Ranvir Shorey second son Chironji Lal Khosla Parvin Dabas and his daughter. When they reach the spot they find that the site has been occupied by someone else and on further investigation find that it has been captured by a property usurping nexus headed by a man named Kishan Khurana Boman Irani. Khurana demands Rs. 15 lakhs to vacate the plot which Khosla refuses to give. Bunty gathers few local strongmen and forcefully destroys the walls and reoccupies the plot. But Khurana has the police on his side and ...";

Hence the Indian masses cannot be blamed for their taste in cinema simply because they have rarely been exposed to truly magnificent cinema.This is partly because most of the commercial movies are profitcentric as they ought to be but these movies revolve around a nucleus of a few 'stars' and the producers bank on these 'brandambassadors' to make the movie click plus the profit from the sales from the movie soundtrack is a very crucial part in the success of a movie and this incumbency on songs is unparalleled which leads to so many abrupt speed breakers in the narration of a story so that these songs can be accommodated. And it works sometimes but the calamity is that every movie is focused around the same philosophy.This movie stands apart because it does not fall prey to any of the above. There is no 'brand ambassador' for this movie. The forte of this movie lies in its simplicity sincerity and substance and much of that credit goes to the director Divakar Banerjee.At the crust of the movie are two of the finest actors in the country today Anupam Kher as the ordinary middle class fifty six year old man Khoslain Delhi whose only drive in life is to build a new house for his family that has his wife Kiran Juneja his elder son BalwantRanveer Shourie his second son Chirounjilal aka Cherry Parvin Dabas and his daughter. Balwant is a jobless waster and Cherry works for an MNC but wants to leave the country for a better job in America.Navin Nishcol Bapu and Vinay Pathak Asif Iqbal are also assets to this movie.Boman IraniKhurana is a very wealthy and sly business man who captures the plot of land that Khosla had bought for building his dream house. Now if Khosla wants the plot of land that belongs to him he must buy it from Khurana the problem though is that he doesn't have the money as he spent his life's savings to buy that plot of land. This movie is about how an ordinary middle class old man tries to reclaim his stolen robbed dream back from the powerful clasps of this crooked property dealer.The film looks real. Actors don't wear designer costumes there are no exquisite locations but what it does have is ingenuity and a sense of realm. The movie does not focus on a couple of 'brand ambassadors' but does justice to characters and all the actors have done a commendable job in keeping it real. The characterization is superb. The dialogues are witty and have a subtle Indian flavour in them. It also has a hint of dark sense of humour. The opening scene is funny but is inconspicuously and heavily sarcastic which is excellent dark comedy material. You will see many of those in the movie. I would agree that Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron is an excellent reference point.The movie does not exaggerate and neither does it take itself lightly. There are many scenes in the movie that manifest the problems of the common man who lives a mundane life and is helpless. Those who watch movies are these common men and they would love to see something that they can relate to.The best Hindi movie that I've seen since Lagaan. Will remember it for is originality sarcasm and its intrinsic common man appeal.".

	schema:reviewBody "After Lageraho Munnabhai...Bollywood could not have got any better than...THIS. All along these years we've been watching films that crawl without any story or soul...only effort going into them being a good make up in terms of ostentatious song and dance routines only to make it more saleable. and all these years even I've been watching all this. Appreciating some...sulking at others craving for the movies as they were in times of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Sai Paranjape. Khosla Ka Ghosla comes straight out of that genre and sweeps you like gust of fresh air. Since most of you must be knowing the story and for those who don't they must be going and watching this at all cost Khosla Ka Ghosla is one of the finest examples of storytelling in recent times. Every character is sketched out so immaculately that for even a second you can't say that you don't know this person in real life.An absolutely brilliant background score makes this movie a thorough joyride with the highs and troughs dealt with extreme intelligence.As for the performances we know what Anupam Kher is capable of and Boman Irani is definitely a class apart. Navin Nischol in spite of his personal troubles makes a very impressive comeback. Kiron Juneja is very good. Parvin Dabas and Tara Sharma give perfectly restrained and energetic performances respectively.But the one who takes the cake away for my money is the support cast lead by Ranvir Shorey... Every time he opens his mouth he leaves you in splits....and mind you...no slapstick there...everything very common...very everyday like... but brilliantly delivered. His chemistry with Vibnay Pathak in The Great Indian Comedy Show seems to have rubbed off onto KKG too and both give absolutely mesmerizing performances along with the rest of the cast.Every scene every dialog...gives you a great sense of happiness...which you might not identify then and there itself in the theater as in the case of Lageraho Munnabhai but you'll definitely ponder over it and a smile will cross your face even after you've come out of the theater and it will stay with you for a long long time.Brilliant piece of Cinema...Go watch it!!!!Nine and a half on Ten!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "How many times have you come across a film that makes you smile while you have a lump in your throat at the same time? Such are the dwellers of this nest that you feel sorry for them for the trouble they land themselves into but such is the treatment of the film that rather than being a compulsive tearjerker it has that feel good effect on you without being overtly mushy either.Never since the times of Sai Paranjpe or Basu Chatterjee has one come across as authentic portrayal of the middleclass in films as you get to see here. Khosla Ka Ghosla talks about a family in Delhi headed by Mr. Khosla Anupam Kher who invests all his life's savings to buy a plot on which he dreams of building his own bungalow. But after buying the plot he finds the land being encroached by a builder Khurana Boman Irani. He uses paisa pehalwan and politics to get his land back but is too diminutive in front of the mammoth Khurana. Finally the straightforward family attempts devious ways to get back their land.Despite the film being delayed for long the narrative still comes out as fresh and original. An average audience can so much relate to the characters of the film since none of them play the conventional largerthanlife Bollywood hero but a common man. Where else can you find the male lead of the film Parvin Dabas with a name that goes as Chiraunjilal? Kiran Juneja playing Khosla's wife in her minuscule bit is such a refreshing change from the sugar sweet Farida Jalal or the melodramatic Reema Lagoo kind of on screen mothers. Or for that matter Ranvir Shorey as the elder brother isn't the usual dominating or overprotective type clichd character.The scenes that unfold come out so much out of real life situations. The only inspiration that the film derives is from real life. The semiautobiographical script by Jaideep Sahni is original amazing and entertaining. Debutante director Dibakar Bannerjee extracts fine performances from every member of the cast and never lets anybody go overboard or underact. The comic timing of the characters is simply flawless. The theme of the film might be a serious issue but the treatment is very lighthearted. Songs are restricted just to the background and Kailash Kher's 'Chak De Phatte' gels perfect with the proceedings. The background score attributed to Boman Irani's character every time he enters the scene needs a special mention.Post Maine Gandhi Ko Nahi Maara this is Anupam Kher's best performance. He has performed such common man characters before and plays his part effortlessly even here. From Munnabhai MBBS Being Cyrus to Khosla Ka Ghosla Boman Irani perhaps is the only villain who can successfully add a natural comic effect to negative characters. Parvin Dabbas Vinay Pathak Navin Nischol and Kiran Juneja are apt in their roles. Ranvir Shorey plays the most hilarious comic characters to have come out in recent times without being goofy at any time. The actor is simply amazing.Khosla Ka Ghosla is an appetizing pure vegetarian thali in the age of nonveg junkies. Go relish it!".

In fact before I went for the movie I myself thought that this was a bore. It is a beautiful and realistic film. There is simple humour which just helps in 'digesting' the plot. The good thing is that all the actors even the ones speaking just one or two dialogues give a superb performance. Anupak Kher acts really well. I have no words to describe Boman Irani's acting. He is amazing. he just does not act the same in any movie. I also liked Navin Nischol's acting a lot. Apart from that Parvin Dabas Vinay Pathak and Ranvir Shorey give terrific performances. Dibakar Banerjee has directed the film beautifully. It is beautifully paced. Every scene is an important scene in the film. It is not dragged. As far as music is concerned music is not really needed. But I think BapiTutul and Dhruv Dhalla gave superb background score. KKG just reinforces the fact that there is no dearth of acting talent in India just that one must not go for a film just because it has a star cast. A star would have taken the simplicity of the film. In short KKG is an awesome film and one which everybody will relish.".

	schema:reviewBody "Last night I woke up at 8.30 in the night after sleeping for like 6 years at a stretch after the overnight stay me and my friends had. 9 PM. On air is Khosla Ka Ghosla. Now I really wanted to watch that movie when it was released but just didn't had the time to and right now I wasn't in the mood for it but since nothing else on TV was worth a watch I decided to see the film.After a while I realized that 40 minutes had gone by and not for one moment did I feel that KKG had a scene so far which was boring or unnecessary. KKG is truly gripping. It sucks you into it and you'll start getting concerned about Kamal Kishore Khosla Anupam Kher. Khosla is a very innocent middleclass service man who gets a plot of land from Kishan Khurana Boman Irani out of his lifesavings a lump amount of 30 lacs but things get terrible when Khurana doesn't exactly let Khosla get the land until Khosla would pay Khurana another 1015 lacs.As much as I would love to say that Khosla Ka Ghosla was a movie which belonged to Anupam Kher and Boman Irani I cannot deny that it belonged to the other artists as well. What I like so much about Khosla Ka Ghosla is that it does not star big mainstream artists in it except Boman Irani  Anupam Kher and if it did maybe it would have lost its simplicity. Anupam Kher has been doing really lesser number of roles as compared to what he used to in the 90s but after Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Maara Kya Kool Hain Hum and Rang De Basanti Kher almost steals the show again. Khosla Ka Ghosla is very very realistic and that is its USP. Of course there are a few little flaws in the script but that does not stop KKG from becoming an entertaining ride without moving away from the realistic world. The brand of humour used in the movie is simple and enjoyable and one thing which I liked very much about this film is its characterization I cannot deny that I liked every character present in the movie and it felt that they were straight out of someone's lives. Although Khurana and his assistant reminded me of Lucky Singh  Kuku in Lage Raho Munnabhai bit basically because of the role they played.Boman and Anupam of course do play the parts beautifully but one performance which I liked a lot was that was Bappu's Navin Nischol. Now what Bappu is doing in the film I cannot say because I feel that would give out a part of the story. Ranvir Shorey and Vinay Pathak come together again after they did once in Jism. Ranvir as Anupam's elder son and Vinay as the guy whom Boman had betrayed play their parts with ease and rock it. Tara Sharma's accent is weird but I liked her here and the director gets credit for that. Parween Dabas too... actually its not the actors that are there but the characters. Such is the magic of dbutante director Dibakar Banerjee and writer Jaideep Sahani. Full marks to the director who's earned my respect.The music by composers Bapi Tutul and Dhruv too is great. Chakk De Phadde sung by Kailesh Kher which is also the OST of the movie is nice and totally in mood of the film. The other tracks too offer great help in carrying the story forward.When Anupam Kher had said that this is a tribute to Hrishikesh Mukherjee's filmmaking style I'm sure he truly meant it. Khosla Ka Ghosla is simple innocent realistic and entertaining. Go watch it if you want to see a quality film. Much better than the Karan Johar or Rakesh Roshan flicks which are recognised by Filmfare not for their creativity but commercial success. Khosla Ka Ghosla made my mood. Three cheers to the movie! 7.510 from httpmuviegeek.blogspot.com".

What I like so much about Khosla Ka Ghosla is that it does not star big mainstream artists in it except Boman Irani  Anupam Kher and if it did maybe it would have lost its simplicity. Anupam Kher has been doing really lesser number of roles as compared to what he used to in the 90s but after Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Maara Kya Kool Hain Hum and Rang De Basanti Kher almost steals the show again. Khosla Ka Ghosla is very very realistic and that is its USP. Of course there are a few little flaws in the script but that does not stop KKG from becoming an entertaining ride without moving away from the realistic world. The brand of humour used in the movie is simple and enjoyable and one thing which I liked very much about this film is its characterization I cannot deny that I liked every character present in the movie and it felt that they were straight out of someone's lives. Although Khurana and his assistant reminded me of Lucky Singh  Kuku in Lage Raho Munnabhai bit basically because of the role they played.Boman and Anupam of course do play the parts beautifully but one performance which I liked a lot was that was Bappu's Navin Nischol. Now what Bappu is doing in the film I cannot say because I feel that would give out a part of the story. Ranvir Shorey and Vinay Pathak come together again after they did once in Jism. Ranvir as Anupam's elder son and Vinay as the guy whom Boman had betrayed play their parts with ease and rock it. Tara Sharma's accent is weird but I liked her here and the director gets credit for that. Parween Dabas too... actually its not the actors that are there but the characters. Such is the magic of dbutante director Dibakar Banerjee and writer Jaideep Sahani. Full marks to the director who's earned my respect.The music by composers Bapi Tutul and Dhruv too is great. Chakk De Phadde sung by Kailesh Kher which is also the OST of the movie is nice and totally in mood of the film. The other tracks too offer great help in carrying the story forward.When Anupam Kher had said that this is a tribute to Hrishikesh Mukherjee's filmmaking style I'm sure he truly meant it. Khosla Ka Ghosla is simple innocent realistic and entertaining. Go watch it if you want to see a quality film. Much better than the Karan Johar or Rakesh Roshan flicks which are recognised by Filmfare not for their creativity but commercial success. Khosla Ka Ghosla made my mood. Three cheers to the movie! 7.510 from httpmuviegeek.blogspot.com";

Tara Sharma is also quite well cast though Koel Purie could have been a better choice.The things that strike you in the movie are the typical characters the sarcastic humor the realism and the wonderful Delhi feel that is hard to miss.

Just as everything seems set for a ground breaking ceremony a powerful builder Khurana Boman Irani encroaches the plot and shatters all his dreams.How the motley crew of his family and their friends help Khosla finally realize his dreams forms the rest of the story. The plot develops in such a thrilling manner that there are moments you would actually pray for Khosla's mission team.Casting is perfect. Apart from great performances by veterans like Anupam Kher Boman Irani and Navin Nischol you will enjoy even the characters played by offbeat actors like Ranvir Shorey Frankly I didn't knew he can act so well Parvin Dabas Nitish Pandey and Vinay Pathak.I would call it A Superb Comic Thriller. Excellent Job Mr.Dibakar Banerjee.".

As the Khoslas run from pillar to post to get justice the seamy side of the politicians and the public servants is slowly revealed. The movie shows us that not all con men and women live in lavish farmhouses and wear slick clothes and dark glasses!

The ending is not particularly authentic but it does give you a sense of hope in this movie that otherwise is best thought of as a sad commentary on the situation in the homeland.It deserves top marks  for me only two things jarred a bit. Anupam Kher's morning ablutions were sort of 'railway station third class waiting room' like but the rest of his persona was that of a semisophisticate. Meghna had a strange accent that one would associate with a nonnative Hindi speaker but I did like her acting and character otherwise.All in all this is excellent fare  and it is a must watch!".

What happens then is what you have to see by yourself. The movie puts a very good light on the corrupt system as well as the position of youth of India. The eldest son Chirotilal is a good symbol of all those software developers who wants to leave India for better career but are still held here due to their duties towards parents. The movie as other Bollywood movies also feature love family drama. But the main theme comedy is there till end. All the actors have done their best. Songs though not much are good to listen and did not make us bore. Overall its a good movie which can be watched in family.".

However when he takes his family to see the place they find that some rich jerk has simply stolen the property and put a wall around it...and a nasty bodyguard to keep this family off their own land!! Naturally his children are angry but Kamal tells them to relax...they can work it out with Mr. Khurana who is claiming the property. Well they can't! The crook demands they pay him for their land...and the local police are bought and paid for by this rich crook.So what do you do when you can't find satisfaction any other way? Yep they decide to rob Khurana...and to do it they'll get the money needed to buy back their own property from Khurana himself! To do it they decide to offer to sell Khurana some amazing property and allow his greed to get the better of him...and of course the property will not be real. So how exactly will they pull this off? See the film.This film is a bit unusual because it has no song or dance numbers. Now not all Indian films have these lavish dance numbers...but so many of the ones they export here to the States usually do. And fortunately while the film is a comedy it's much more restrained and subtle than many of the other Indian comedies I've seen. I'm no expert on their films but I liked this one.

	schema:headline " Horrifying reality blended with fiction";
	schema:reviewBody "Khosla ka Ghonsla is a lowbudget and simple yet admirable movie which is a realistic picture of the horrifying reality in Indian metros being faced by the middle class Indian people.Indian cities and villages too are the victims of many kinds of mafias viz. the transport mafia the tourism mafia the extortion mafia the kidnapping mafia and so on and so forth. Khosla Ka Ghonsla Khosla's nest is a movie which deals with the activities of land mafia which is neckdeep involved in usurping the land of middle and lower class helpless people not able to resist their unlawful activities and save their land bought with their hardearned money. It's a deservingly much acclaimed movie directed by Dibakar Banerjee.The story belongs to a salaried person Mr. Khosla Anupam Kher who buys a plot with his lifelong savings to build his own house spacious enough to accommodate his whole family involving his wife daughter and sons. But he is taken aback to find that his plot has been grabbed by a landmafioso Khurana Boman Irani by muscle power. Now he is asked to pay a hefty sum to get his own plot vacated. And the more painful thing for him is that the lawenforcing agencies are also like the handmaids of the baddie strengthening the hands of the wrongdoer instead of ensuring justice to the victim. Thus poor Mr. Khosla the victim of the unlawful deed is further victimized by the lawenforcers who have sold their souls to the culprits. As Mr. Khosla's elder son is planning to migrate to US leaving his familymembers behind in India Mr. Khosla is further depressed. However the son Cherry Parveen Dabaas finally realizes the pain of his father and fortunately comes across Asif Vinay Pathak who is the exaccomplice of Khurana. Asif shows him the way to con the conman. How the Khosla family with the help of some actors Navin Nischal and Nitish Pandey and Cherry's girlfriend Meghna Tara Sharma are able to swindle Khurana for a hefty sum and get its plot released from him by paying him his own money forms the remaining part of the story.The story is very impressive and except the final sequences of the Khoslas' swindling Khurana is utterly realistic. The emotions of a middleclass straightforward man his simplicity and naiveness in dealing with the shrewd ones his pain upon seeing his dreams shattered the family bonds the indifference of the young professional towards the feelings of his parents everything is touchingly realistic and contributes in making this simple movie a winner all the way.Cinematic liberties have been taken for the sequences in the later part of the story. Conmen cannot be conned so easily as shown in the movie. Hence though the message of fighting the devil with fire is exemplary it makes the movie unreal on this count. I personally believe that rascals deserve to be dealt with by rascality only and while dealing with them the good people should leave their goodness at least temporarily. However the way it is shown is not realistic. It appears to be something told in the lighter vein and imposed on the narrative to lead the story to the desired climax. All the same the efforts of the writer Jaideep Sahni and the director deserve high accolades. The narrative flows smoothly without any undue digression and keeps the audience tied to their seats. The title of the movie is also apt because own house is as dear and as coveted a thing to a middle class Indian as nest is to a bird.The performances are just excellent. The frontrunner is definitely Anupam Kher who has given the performance of his lifetime second only to Saaransh. Boman Irani is able to make the audience laugh even though he is in a negative role. All others including Parveen Dabaas Tara Sharma Ranvir Shourey Kiran Juneja Rupan Bajwa Vinay Pathak Naveen Nischal and Nitish Pandey have also done quite well.Music is according to the mood of the movie. Editing is good. Technically the movie is perfect. Dialogues are also impressive.Khosla Ka Ghonsla is not a comedy. In fact it is a serious movie of the genre of the movies made by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee in the seventies and the early eighties providing light moments amidst the portrayal of the dark reality prevailing in the lives of the Indian middle class people. The middle class people in the Indian cities managing through moderate salaries can perceive this movie as a mirror of their lives.".

Khosla Ka Ghonsla Khosla's nest is a movie which deals with the activities of land mafia which is neckdeep involved in usurping the land of middle and lower class helpless people not able to resist their unlawful activities and save their land bought with their hardearned money. It's a deservingly much acclaimed movie directed by Dibakar Banerjee.The story belongs to a salaried person Mr. Khosla Anupam Kher who buys a plot with his lifelong savings to build his own house spacious enough to accommodate his whole family involving his wife daughter and sons. But he is taken aback to find that his plot has been grabbed by a landmafioso Khurana Boman Irani by muscle power. Now he is asked to pay a hefty sum to get his own plot vacated. And the more painful thing for him is that the lawenforcing agencies are also like the handmaids of the baddie strengthening the hands of the wrongdoer instead of ensuring justice to the victim. Thus poor Mr. Khosla the victim of the unlawful deed is further victimized by the lawenforcers who have sold their souls to the culprits. As Mr. Khosla's elder son is planning to migrate to US leaving his familymembers behind in India Mr. Khosla is further depressed. However the son Cherry Parveen Dabaas finally realizes the pain of his father and fortunately comes across Asif Vinay Pathak who is the exaccomplice of Khurana. Asif shows him the way to con the conman. How the Khosla family with the help of some actors Navin Nischal and Nitish Pandey and Cherry's girlfriend Meghna Tara Sharma are able to swindle Khurana for a hefty sum and get its plot released from him by paying him his own money forms the remaining part of the story.The story is very impressive and except the final sequences of the Khoslas' swindling Khurana is utterly realistic. The emotions of a middleclass straightforward man his simplicity and naiveness in dealing with the shrewd ones his pain upon seeing his dreams shattered the family bonds the indifference of the young professional towards the feelings of his parents everything is touchingly realistic and contributes in making this simple movie a winner all the way.Cinematic liberties have been taken for the sequences in the later part of the story. Conmen cannot be conned so easily as shown in the movie. Hence though the message of fighting the devil with fire is exemplary it makes the movie unreal on this count. I personally believe that rascals deserve to be dealt with by rascality only and while dealing with them the good people should leave their goodness at least temporarily. However the way it is shown is not realistic. It appears to be something told in the lighter vein and imposed on the narrative to lead the story to the desired climax. All the same the efforts of the writer Jaideep Sahni and the director deserve high accolades. The narrative flows smoothly without any undue digression and keeps the audience tied to their seats. The title of the movie is also apt because own house is as dear and as coveted a thing to a middle class Indian as nest is to a bird.The performances are just excellent. The frontrunner is definitely Anupam Kher who has given the performance of his lifetime second only to Saaransh. Boman Irani is able to make the audience laugh even though he is in a negative role. All others including Parveen Dabaas Tara Sharma Ranvir Shourey Kiran Juneja Rupan Bajwa Vinay Pathak Naveen Nischal and Nitish Pandey have also done quite well.Music is according to the mood of the movie. Editing is good. Technically the movie is perfect. Dialogues are also impressive.Khosla Ka Ghonsla is not a comedy. In fact it is a serious movie of the genre of the movies made by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee in the seventies and the early eighties providing light moments amidst the portrayal of the dark reality prevailing in the lives of the Indian middle class people. The middle class people in the Indian cities managing through moderate salaries can perceive this movie as a mirror of their lives.";

Khosla Ka Ghosla is one movie you could watch over and over again in good times in bad times and in times which can't be categorized under either. This is just a movie for all seasons!Now why would i dare appreciate a movie without giving a single reason? That's because this movie doesn't need a reason to be liked! And even if the critic in you strives to find a prominent reason you'd be in riches! A nearflawless depiction of an urban Indian middleclass family leaves you amazed and very much in splits. The mortals who've had a fortune to spend their childhoods in the lanes of our own Delhi will undoubtedly understand the otherwise some lostintranslation jokes. But do not be repelled by this statement this movie is for all of us. The theme is extremely topical but dealt in a humorous manner by a debut director Dibakar Bannerjee. And by gollies! Does he deliver!The movie covers the chronicles of an average Indian family struggling to come in terms with a fact that their hardearned land has been captured by a landshark and how they react in such a situation. The characters look so real and endearing that you could confuse them as one of your own distant uncles! Anupam Kher has played the typical 55yr oldman character before in Saaransh with utter perfection and he does it again here with lan. Boman Irani has to be given a special mention for a mere fact that it's a tough job looking like an ostentatious Punjabi builder when you've been brought up as a Parsi all your life. And believe me he could pass on as a Punjabi any given day of his life. All the other actors namely Ranvir Shorey Kiran Juneja Vinay Pathak Parveen Dabbas Naveen Nischol Tara Sharma etc. are wonderfully sketched out and believable. Believable being the key word here. The attention to detail is so strong that such a seemingly light comedy makes you observe novel mannerisms every time you watch it. Go for it and laugh your ass off!".

After a deadly injury a character doesn't show any sight of the pain except in his words.Dialogs in the movie are fantastic If you'll write down all the lines of all characters you'll hardly fill 1.5 pages A4 size.Watching this movie a felt like I'm fooled  creators didn't want to work to make it interesting they used CGIFXfightingshooting without everything else that makes movie worthwhile and sold it to me using a bright wrap.People were leaving the movie theatre in the middle of this picture.Hope next movie will be much better.";

There's no plot just a situation that Alice has to fight her way out of. There are some good stunts but nothing we haven't seen before. Most of the action is just ridiculous...bad guys that don't die guns that don't run out of ammo characters that can be interchangeably good or evil at the whim of the scriptwriter. It's like a fiveyearold playing with toy soldiers. The actors are so wooden and look so plastic that I honestly couldn't tell if they were CGI creations or actual human beings.Milla and her husband should be ashamed of themselves.".

The movie made it quite clear early on that there would be no complicated plot lines or character development. And the dialogue was equally simplistic. The lines sounded something like this  go to the 3rd mountain and collect 20 coins and 3 golden power boosters. One quickly sensed this was not a movie at all rather a simple video game cut scene. Also problematical were the incredibly goofy scenes with thousands of bullets aimed point blank at the heroes and all of them missing. It just takes all of the fun out of a movie when there is absolutely no sense of danger to the heroes.On the plus side the action sequences were very well shot and the cgi was first class. That said it just wasn't enough to make this reviewer glad to be sitting in the audience".

It's not even enough eye candy for fans of the games. I blame myself for being a glutton for punishment I guess I've seen all the Resident Evil movies so far so I guess I'm in for the long haul. An overlonghaul. The fact that I'm a huge fan of the games unfortunately doesn't help when passing judgment on the movies. Retribution is in my opinion the worst one to date. The story is just for lack of a more sophisticated word DUMB. Spoilers to followAn underground facility that uses clones to recreate outbreaks? Sounds like a huge waste of time and resources to me. And the reasoning behind having said facility? To show China what the outbreak would look like in the United States. To show Japan what the outbreak would look like in Russia. Really? You mean you couldn't just put a zombie in a room with 4 people and show them what happens? Or at least a computer simulation? Much more cost effective. Having a big dumb facility just makes for having a lot of big dumb plot holes and questions. With all of those clones running around down there you mean to tell me you can't just repopulate the human race? How do you keep having enough clothes to clothe them all? Who cleans up the bloody messes after each simulation? Why does Wesker have a change of heart all of a sudden for the human race and wants Alice to help save it? Wasn't he hellbent on trying to kill everyone in the last movie Resident Evil I'm Lost? Why does Umbrella have a supply of leather costumes for Alice? Why doesn't anyone have to reload ever? Leon's not using the Chicago Typewriter and I don't see anyone shooting any BSAA emblems so according to all reasoning ever guns need to be reloaded occasionally. Why didn't Alice just F'n recognize the ridiculously OBVIOUS glowing badguy looking scarab on Jill's chest? HEY! That must be her source of evil! WHERE IS CHRIS AND CLAIRE REDFIELD? Whose bright idea was it to have a deaf clone?! THE LIST GOES ON AND ON!!!!!! Call this movie Resident Evil Plot Holes. Although we love seeing our favorite characters and subtle nods towards the games we don't appreciate them being utterly stupid. Please do it right otherwise you're doing us a disservice. Throwing in new characters doesn't do them justice. I'm really glad you included Leon so he could have such a stimulating conversation with Alice. I'm not letting you pass Let me pass Ok. And THAT WAS BARRY?! Seriously? Oh good you gave him a Colt Python so he's automatically Barry. Ada was at least legit everything about her was right if nothing else in the movie. Here they mentioned Las Plagas. According to this movie Las Plagas are steroids you can inject into your Michelle Rodriguez to make her do XRay punches to people's hearts ala the new Mortal Kombat. I'd much rather see her turn into a head sprouter than seeing her juiced up on 'roids. We've seen Girl Fight already. You know what I'd rather just not see her at all because she is in no way important. Oh and hi Luther I'm glad you survived the last movie and mysteriously teamed up with Leon. It's so important that you survived because you're such an integral part in this one...oh no now you're dead. Great job. Everything about this movie is just stupid. I didn't see it in 3D thank God but I'm sure that sucked too. It's time to just scrap the franchise. Matter of fact it was time to scrap it 3 movies ago. Just make a REAL Resident Evil movie for the love of everything holy. Going in you know the movie is bad so I got what I deserved but my God I didn't think the franchise could actually get any worse. The bright side? This movie hit rock bottom so the next one couldn't possibly any worseor could it?".

There is no way I can stick up for this movie or any reason I'd even want to. I can't really give you a synopsis cause I'm not even sure what I just watched. All I can say is that it was huge disappointment in every facet possible. Despite the silliness of the previous films they always grounded themselves in some type of realism within the reigns of its premise. This entry doesn't even feel like it's a part of the same franchise. Gone is the fun and it's been replaced with ritzy production values and no discernible storyline. It's a movie based on a video game in which they are actually part of a video game and nothing is really happening. Despite a somewhat promising start with a cool reverse battle sequence a best of franchise film reel and an inventive and even a little scary trip into suburbia we than move on to the supposed purpose of the film which just doesn't make sense at all. I mean the choices are just astoundingly bad why make the little girl deaf and the film filled with sign language why set it in this underground facility why is all of this happening with this type of technology how does the remaining human population even have a chance how is Wesker alive and why is he good now? he's not human??? None of these questions will be answered and lets not even discuss the frustratingly awkward scenes like one in which one of the good guys has a double unnecessary death an uninspired nod towards the Alien franchise and repetitive scenarios that get less effective the more you see them really the squid face things. Also the acting has never been good in the Resident Evil series but Milla Jovovich had evoked a cool sense of fierce heroine this time around she just seems plain bored as do the other actors. Filled with insipid dialogue questionable plottingoverlong pacing a weird bad movie from the 90's score mediocre fight choreography except for the scene with the chain and a crapload of wasted potential this movie just feels like a bad dream. Sometimes when I'm really looking forward to a movie I'll dream about it the night before and it will be horrible well this is what this feels like. Because in no possible way what I just watched is a resident evil movie. Despite all of my complaining the movie does have some decent scenes the suburbia one I brought up before was kinda neat another featuring Ada and Alice against 2 ax men and the chain fight in Tokyo. Besides that it's all just a big plodding waste of existential cinematic trash. A brainless soulless unintentionally funny horroractionsci fi hybrid that despite a larger budgetreturning cast members and more impressive production values feels like an overlong filler episode that leaves me with a big question mark. Why has this happened to my beloved franchise???".

That is not a good thing for a movie and trust me it shows. The plot has some vague references to the former movie but that's quickly forgotten and all your in for is a mess of action scenes and bad and I mean bad CGI effects. Somehow the actors manage to look not in the least interested in the gun battles they take part in and at the same time do a damn good job to remove any sense of immersion you might have scrapped together for instance by appearing utterly unfamiliar with handling their weapons.. There is some odd alien references.. or more likely inspired events that make no sense in the overall story and world.Finally the whole absurdstorm will end with you sitting back confused as to what you just watched shaking your head in shocked astonishment trying to comprehend just how bad it was.

I even have a great idea for coaching some of the mediocre actors into believable ones.Paul S. Anderson What are you talking about? We just worked out some great ideas. Lots of action explosions new characters. We have everything the fans want. As for acting? Did you see the first game? The lame voice acting did not deter its fans. These actors will do plenty fine for the fans. C'mon let's make this movie!And this is why this movie turned out the way it did.";

Apart from the once in a while visuals the movie has not been able to get even close to expectations. The first 10 minutes of the movie and you will start feeling disconnected from the movie already not caring at all what is gonna happen in the next scene. After resident evil 3  4 I was expecting a lot out of this installment and from Paul W.S. Anderson but he has not been able to live up the mark at all. The action scenes rather than being nailbiting turned out to be hilarious and funny. There isn't a single moment in the movie where you are actually glued to screen. Milla Jovovich looks pretty as always but that won't save the movie. All others have done a horrible job with their acting especially Sienna Guillory. I would say that the only reason you would want to watch this movie is if you are a fan of the resident evil series and you don't mind wasting your money and time for the sake of this series.".

The film more or less follows the same sequence of action of a video game and follows the saga of heroin leaving a another clear hook for another sequence.Visually as always the movie has a particular visual and it's very well done with very nice CG effects  creatures and makeup and lots of action which borders the impossible. The film uses contrast in a very dark tone this time.The music follows the action and fits perfectly and the acting is good within the general context.Overall I liked this version for the general action and the effects  other than that it's empty especially the story and character development that is superficial. But generally the action is what we expect from Resident Evil movie in the end not something epic worthy of the best action film together like every other RE movie was after all. Get it if you like the other RE movies and like action videogames in general.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have fond memories of every Resident Evil game in the main series and I am a fan still clamoring to play Biohazard 1.5. I still remember renting the directors cut of the first game way back in the 1990's. Of course back then we had the rumours of a George A Remero directed film that would be released after the commercials starring Brad Renfro started airing in Japan. For awhile we were under the mistaken belief that the father of zombie films would be bringing one of the best zombie video games to the silver screen. In 2002 we were unfortunate enough to see the first film of a truly bad what would become movie franchise. It saddens me to see that the franchise will most probably see a sixth entry.The film starts off with a slow mo scene played in reverse then just played what should have been the ending of the last film is the beginning of the new film and I wouldn't be surprised if it was the ending of the previous film as we are then treated to a recap by Alice herself of every other film. What a waste of time and money. A homage to the zombie films of the 70's is the best scene in this film where Alice is now living in Suburbia with a husband and an kid. the zombies pile in and Michelle Rodriguez is reintroduced as the most worthless character unsurprisingly it is a clone. the scene ends and we return to an truly awful storyline. It tries to imitate Operation raccoon City or the mercenaries play mode by having different scenarios in Moscow New York and Suburbia it is explained by the crap story point that umbrella tried to sell the virus by showing potential buyers what the T Virus is capable of. It also introduces Ada Wong at this point looking very much like the character in the game not very well acted by the actress but that has become an trademark of the franchise so it is an surprise when the Kevin Durand actually makes an decent Barry Burton and it is a joy even for a few remote seconds to be treated to an character that was in the video game that is actually done justice. Leon s Kennedy also appears but he is not given much screen time and unlike Kevin does not stand out and it is all to blame to the fact that Alice should be kept alive and invincible could this be due to the fact that the director is married to Milla Jovovich. Albert Wesker let me just stop there i don't want to talk about that butchering. Aside from the overall acting with an few exceptions the backgrounds especially in the 3d version seems like it was done through the age old method of playing a film behind the actors and actresses this does not do much especially in 3d it looks crap and it does not have the charm other bad movies have or the old time horrors have. the film is bad in every aspects the trailers is better than the film hell the trailer for devil may cry had better story line than the entirety of this film.the sad thing about this all Resident Evil return and so will Alice. Paul WS Anderson will get richer though he has an less than stellar career and has made mediocrity into a industry that is profitable. Stop these kind of films now and in the future we might have an industry based on quality rather than quantity. As for my love of the games can't wait for Resident Evil 6 once again clarification the game not the film. but please no more spin offs.".

	schema:headline " 5th Resident Evil film... not too bad";
	schema:reviewBody "I would like to point out that these films based on the hit videogame series have been made for basically showing us zombies lickers and a variety of bad ass undead getting their asses handed to them by a smokinghot Milla Jovovich in tight black spandex or skimpy dresses... And that's why we love them! But the major complaint about these films are the confusing story lines and such people go in to see a movie like this and wonder wtf is going on unless you've actually seen the first 4 films. As for Resident Evil Retribution... I liked it I probably liked it almost as much as Afterlife probably my favorite in this series. It is very confusing at first even for a follower of the films like myself but it eventually comes together and you understand very quickly what was going on. And I don't want to give away any of the awesome action scenes here after they fight through everything in the film they eventually join an old enemy and clearly states without a doubt that there will be one more possibly final film with the humans taking their last stand against the mutant undead. I am hyped! It's actually nostalgic watching this film because it brings in a couple of old faces from the first three films but it's for a reason that'd you'd have to watch the movie to understand. And we finally get Leon from the games into the movies and it's great to see him. I'm actually not sure who plays him as I'm typing this but he looked fine enough as Leon and surprisingly had the hairstyle down too. Now the action and undeadmutants... fantastic some of the best the franchise has to offer. We get a giant mutant licker harkening back to the original with a licker hunting them down soviet Russian zombies that can actually shoot guns and ride motorcycles a showdown with not one but TWO Axemen and one sexy cat fight scene you'll see what I mean at the end of the movie. Visual effects were very impressive I would have liked to see this in theaters in 3D especially the genius beginning credits when everything was playing backwards. All in all 8 out of 10 just because the action was so damn awesome but people get thoroughly confused during the storyline and that kind of brings down the experience but not by much. Very fun and awesome movie if you're just looking to see undead becoming well dead!".

I've come away not only feeling robbed of the overpriced 3D glasses but confused and angry much like fat kid with no jelly. The movie opens with a fantastic sequence including a slow motion rewind of the fallout from when the Umbrella Corporation located our hero Alice aboard the supposed safe zone a ship called Arcadia. After watching the battle unfold including the first of what soon becomes tiresomely many Tom and Jerrylike showdowns between Jovovich and Guillory Valentine the audience is treated to several relayed shots of action scenes from the previous movies all of which is conveniently explained by Alices latest unkillable female friend Ada Wong Bingbing Li. Helping the ladies escape are a team of male characters some referencing previous movies Boris Kodjoe as Luther West and some as a nod to the original video games John Uurb as Leon Kennedy What follows is two hours worth of unfinished plots confusing references sudden appearances of cast members playing multiple parts Good Rodriguez Bad Rodriguez and more stock henchmen some of which are undead Nazis yes really. Large scale battle scenes take place in famous cities like Moscow and New York while the invincible ladies and their male friends who get shot but thats okay. 'Cause they're MEN stumble closer together to finally make their way out of the newest Umbrella base which is of course located in Russia. Underwater. And ice. And there's submarines. Confused? Good. So after a lovely Dawn of the Dead Esq scene that takes place just after the credits Alice and Wong find themselves discovering a clone child who thinks Alice is her mum. Alice decides to keep her brand new clone child because your face thats why. The addition of a sudden maternal bond from the erstwhile stone cold undead killing machine feels out of place so much so that the wooden interactions between the cast from that point on tells us that even the characters simply aren't buying it. The whole movie plays out uncomfortably somewhere between seeing a train crash and hearing an old lady try to muffle a queef with her handbag. I strongly advise you to wait for DVD.".

This is my first time reviewing a movie on IMDb and the reason I am doing this is because I am so infuriated by so many negative reviews especially the one which is being featured at the IMDb page saying oh how this movie sucks and how Anderson ran into writing blocks yadda yadda yadda.You know since the first movie people have been giving negative critiques saying it is generic saying there is no originality saying there is no storyline saying there are plot holes. What has become out of this is a whole let'sgiveREbadreviewsallthetime bandwagon. I mean it is just so easy finding out flaws out of a movie if you put your mind in it. This movie is awesome for the following reasons 1 Milla Jovovich  She is so full of energy. Her fighting scenes are so surreal and the way she talks the way she moves the whole set just redefines Alice as the whole zombiekilling badass. Her acting is so commendable on this installment. There was one scene  which I won't spoil  where she had to decide quickly and certain circumstances indicated that she might be in grave danger and just that moment she shred a tear of fear this scene was so powerful I still remember it now.2 Opening credits  Seriously negative reviewers? It is one of the most creative ones I have seen for a horror movie. It was so cool seeing bullets of guns flying back to their origins and everything was just spectacular. The cinematography was spoton for the opening credits. For the first in my life I didn't mind the long opening credits. 3 Actionpacked  Who wants a zombie movie without action? This whole movie was so freaking action packed I found myself not breathing during so many scenes. This movie I assure you would hold you on to your seats and make you not wanting to blink because each scene is just so brightly put together.4 Creativity  Seriously? Generic? I have never seen such beautifully crafted zombies in any zombie movies I've seen. This movie just gave a variety of the undead I was so awed whenever the undead attacked Alice or her friends.I would not drone on and on because I realize I am not the kind of person who gets his points across easily. I do know we are all entitled to our opinions but I just can't stand it when the negative reviews are all so unnecessarily negative. Give some credit to this RE's installment's team! They did a great job! Li Bing Bing Ada also did great  she had significant chemistry with Alice and I loved it.Yes there were plot holes but there were quite minor and the mindblowing scenes just overwhelmed these plot holes.If you didn't like the movie you're most probably just another critic who is on the bandwagon or a person who hates zombie movies.I love zombie movies. I love Milla Jovovich. I love Resident Evil. Keep 'em coming.810".

	schema:headline " Short fastpaced and visually impressive RERetribution is a fifth installment that really works.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Resident Evil movies have always received criticism from not only snob critics but also fans for not following the video game's storyline. Nobody expected the original movie to actually be more of a prequel to the games with made up characters and starring Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez. Critics' hated it. Gamers hated it. Yet the general public's response was actually quite good. Looking back that movie had its flaws but was very enjoyable and intense. Anderson managed to create a claustrophobic atmosphere whilst providing enough doses of action. The story was not really important at this point and Anderson played with the audience throughout the movie making Jovovich's Alice a character very easy to sympathize with.The sequels however did not provide enough character moments or story and opted to turn the franchise into a mindless action disaster. Even though the third entry Extinction managed to improve on the character development and story departmentthanks to Mullcahy's directionthe craziness was still the spotlight. All these positive aspects were then thrown completely away in the fourth installment. The story was all over the place the audience cared more for the undead than for the characters the action goes from crazy to WTH? and so on.Now these movies are enjoyable no matter what. Even Afterlife was fun to watch for its stupidity and craziness. It is a shame because something really good could have been made after the original since there was so much potential. Resident Evil Retribution is not different than the three sequels but does mostly everything MUCH better. First Anderson makes sure he brings back the best characters the franchise has had in the past movies connecting Retribution with the first entries. He then provides the movie with a simple but interesting story in a similar way to the original immersive 3D over the top action sequences and outstanding visuals.Retribution is the Fast Five of the Resident Evil franchise. It may not be the best but it is a very decent sequel that fans will absolutely love the general public will enjoy and critics will hate with a passion.The movie is as short as the others but is incredibly fastpaced with nonstop action. There are many continuity issues and plot holes but after four movies you know exactly what you're going to get and be prepared for Retribution to exceed your expectations. This is no masterpiece. There are no strong performances or a deep story with original ideas. This is a fifth installment in an mindless action zombie franchise and in that aspect you CAN'T get better than this. It is certainly better than all the sequels as it manages to restore the sensible elements from the original some jump scares and tense moments included! whilst keeping the insanity and absurdity of the sequels.Short fastpaced and visually impressive RERetribution is a fifth installment that really works.810".

	onyx:emotionText "The Resident Evil movies have always received criticism from not only snob critics but also fans for not following the video game's storyline. Nobody expected the original movie to actually be more of a prequel to the games with made up characters and starring Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez. Critics' hated it. Gamers hated it. Yet the general public's response was actually quite good. Looking back that movie had its flaws but was very enjoyable and intense. Anderson managed to create a claustrophobic atmosphere whilst providing enough doses of action. The story was not really important at this point and Anderson played with the audience throughout the movie making Jovovich's Alice a character very easy to sympathize with.The sequels however did not provide enough character moments or story and opted to turn the franchise into a mindless action disaster.

This movie could only be compared to the 90's action movies with lots of cool effects. The first movie already set the tone that this is unrealistic story do you believe that zombies actually exist?. If you want realism become a volunteer in Iraq or Afghanistan. This is a part of s sequence  threat this as another part of the series. Why would you otherwise expect 1hr of references to the old movies if it is supposed that you already watched them? This is not Star Wars! This part was a pure 1hr action instead of 1hr talks and clichs and like 1 min action. Find out what  holism  is and apply it to this movie franchise. Maybe then you will understand it. Why would you still compare it to the games? If you played the games and expect a movie on the games basically you will be watching a game playthrough. Then I will be laughing on comments like well spent moneyThe only criticism that I have about the series is that Paul drifted away from the zombies being the main issue to being no obstacle at all and focusing on bigger issues like Wesker and stronger mutants. But I understand his decision. If he dramatizes the zombies every new episode the script would be trivial like those TV zombie series. After all  the main character matures and learns how to kill zombies better. This is a pure action SCIfi movie not a drama! Are you still confused? Then probably the RE movie franchise isn't for you.".

However the film seemed real in the same way that reality can be stranger than fiction. One of the things I loved about this movie is that none of it is filmed in Moscow or St. Petersburg as far as I could tell. That is pretty rare for a Russia drama that deals solely with the human condition. You get to see a lot of the small town and semirural dascha parts of Russia in this movie which is much more interesting than seeing St. Basil's Cathedral for the umteenth millionth time.The soundtrack in this movie is probably my most favorite of any Russian movie I have seen. It actually works with the screen material and reminds me a lot of movies like Brat and Bumer. There are parts of the film that seem a bit unpolished and awkward but overall this is definitely one film to check out if you are into Russia films and culture.".

	schema:reviewBody "A moody film about two halfsisters on the run from gangsters. A lot of it is established by the two beautiful young but almost continuously sad looking sisters the somber landscapes and a lot of old and rather monotonous which is a good thing in this case Russian poprock '80s band Kino. There's a lot said with not so many words about the girls their uncertain futures and also about the situation in their area Russia.At times the film develops as simple and straight forward as a teen film a little too much so in my opinion for instance when the good guys come in at such a convenient time at the end and kill the bad guys but as implied before overall not a happy or naive one. There's some intense violence in it which certainly makes this unsuitable for children but that also makes it a fairly honest and unflinching portrayal of one of the bleaker parts of the world.The acting is just fine even though a lot of the time there's no telling what goes on inside their minds  which seems appropriate for the characters.A big 7 out of 10.".

Luke McNamara is a small town boy of modest means attending an Ivy League institution that is never really named but is obviously Yale.  He is hoping to be called for membership into the Skulls a secret society of great status and power. Members of this society have the doors of power wealth and influence thrown wide to them.  This is a dream come true for Luke who spends much of his time fretting over the hundreds of thousands in student loans he is incurring.  When he discovers that one of the members has committed a felony he is torn between his desire for wealth his loyalty to a friend and his conscience.Writer John Pogue U.S. Marshals' has conjured up a good moralistic tale but it is so full of ridiculous premises that it becomes laughable.  This is supposed to be a secret society where other than the members themselves no one knows who the members are.  Yet Pogue and director Rob Cohen present it in such a way that they may as well be advertising their identities on TV. The building where the secret meetings take place is prominently marked with a Skull and only members have keys to the building.  So Duh anyone seen entering the building must be a Skull.  New members get brand new 50000 automobiles and 100000 in cash as if no one will notice this sudden burst of good fortune.  The new members are branded on their wrist and we are supposed to believe that they will never be seen by anyone without their wristwatch on.  The list of inconceivability goes on ad nauseam.The acting is generally quite good.  Joshua Jackson Cruel Intentions' Urban Legend' is excellent as Luke.  He plays the part with just the right combination of idealistic zeal and moral grounding.  He gets great support from Paul Walker She's All That' Varsity Blues' as Caleb Mandrake the spoiled rich kid trying to step out of his father's shadow.  Craig T. Nelson gives a wonderfully nefarious performance as the chairman of the Skulls and Caleb's father.Maybe secret societies exist and maybe they don't.  The fact that no one is sure indicates that if they are more than mere myths they are a lot more secret than depicted here.  I rated this film a 610.  It is an interesting idea that loses credibility in the telling.".

I'm a teen and i enjoyed it for what it was even if it wasn't the greatest film ever made.The plot is intriguing but a  little unrealistic. Luke Macnamara wnats desperately to be apart of a secret society known as the skulls. But he soon realizes that being in this society comes at a price.The plot begins with some intrigue but falls short after awhile and that's when you realize that this film is just there to entertain and yo shold just sit back and enjoy the ride. The acting is actually pretty good. joshua jackson is a telented actor and i bet if he got a better script he could go places. Leslie Bibb is the best because she displays the most emotion. She's very good. Paul walker is the weak link. he needs acting lessons.so guys don't go into this movie looking for a great script or anything like that. just be prepared to be entertained. i most certainly was.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Skulls is a thinly veiled allusion to one of the purportedly most secret of all secret societies Skull and Bones the Yale group to which George Bush the former president belonged. You know all about those secret societies they breed smart rich young men who will put other smart rich young men in power and then those men will put other smart rich young men in power and so forth and yadda yadda yadda. You can find out all sorts of things about Skull and Bones online and I suppose there's a chance some of those things are actually true. But for the purposes of this movie  and this review  suffice to say that The Skulls is a small group mostly made up of rich white kids who get paid scholarships free cars free women the whole works. And what does this secret society ask for in return? Unbound loyalty of course. Unquestioning and absolute loyalty kind of like the Mob really only the Mob is more overtly criminal.The story focuses on Luke a townie at Yale University. Luke wants to go to law school but the tuition's a little high. He's parentless and low on funds so of course he's prime pickings for The Skulls. Will he join them? Darn tootin' he will despite the protests of his best friend and this hot young blonde he likes. They try to reason with him believing their friendship is stronger than his need to be a lawyer but they're wrong. If they were right we'd have no movie.So he joins and wouldn't you know it all kinds of bad things happen to poor Luke. There's murder there's corruption and gosh and golly our boy just doesn't know who to trust. More twists than a Poe novel the only problem is they're not believable twists. If you're cynical about this kind of movie as I am you'll laugh out loud many times both at the acting and the dialogue. The worst offense is in the timing quite frankly. At no point are we led to believe that this society could be a GOOD thing. We know immediately it's bad. See I think to be truly sinister you need to wear a mask of credibility. If I already know how bad you are I won't be as afraid of you or as startled when you actually do something despicable.This is a real chucklefest in the same vein as Final Destination Urban Legends I Know What You Did Last Summer both movies and even the Scream movies which I didn't care for but I know many of you did so whatcha gonna do. You have an attractive cast spouting incredible lines in unbelievable situations. The old moviegoer in us wonders what Jimmy Stewart or Gregory Peck would have done in this movie when they were younger and in Stewart's case alive but that's probably a philosophical debate best left to denizens of the old critics' home. As for me I'd say pass on The Skulls  it's as hollow as its name might imply.".

But it has a sense of momentum that you can't escape and soon your on a ride that combines equal parts laughs and smiles nothing too grim but a for what it is fanatical devotion to its own plot devices. The maguffin of the Skulls society is their rule book a device that comes to charming use late in the movie. William Peterson's senator reminds Joshua Jackson repeatedly that every conflict every ordeal can be solved within the rule book...and indeed within the world of the Skulls this book does hold all the answers. Dropping hints here and there as to how it'll all end the movie has a charming level of mystery no more sinister or thrilling than The Da Vinci Code but thankfully much less serious in its handling.One of my favorite scenes is one of the stupidest. The chosen boys are given a grand reception with the many distinguished alumni on a remote island that at times resembles Alcatraz and Hogwarts School for Wizards. The boys are given expensive diving watches an obvious product placement and then dressed in tuxedos where they shake hands and shift uncomfortably in their cumberbunds...until the director inexplicably cranks out Creed onto the soundtrack Can You Take Me Higher no less! and then this huge door opens and out walk whatever waif models were hot in 2000. And they strut out as if on a runway no sense of acting in any of their faces and it's pure schlock...and I love it!Rob Cohen went on to XXX and then tanked with Stealth but this shows what people in Hollywood saw in the guy. The film is fun never too heavy and perfectly suited for a fall evening with your nonetoointellectual school friends OR consumed in 12 minute intervals on TNT. It's plotted swiftly and compellingly enough to justify its running time...another honor not bestowed on The Da Vinci Code. Basically it's perfectly mindless harmless fun with a better than average cast who seem to revel in the camp of it all. Enjoy when you got nothing better to do.".

Seriously this movie is a quintessential bad 90's movie. And I love it. Suspend your reality for 2 hours and watch this movie. Joshua Jackson as THE athletic star of THE crew team at an Ivy League school unnamed but I think winking and nodding with the jerseys with Y on it say it all. I've never seen such a scrawny crew member in my life. Paul Walker as an IVY LEAGUE student. SUSPEND REALITY. It's worth it. Paul Walker is one of my favorite actors of all time because he cannot silent the surfer boy inside himself. These two men coupled with fraternity bro dialog it has everything. Remember skulls are forever. Skulls are soul mates. We are watching you all the time. You get 20g's and a car. An implied racially charged storyline. Did you know that if you really wanted to find out who was a skull you JUST have to take off their watch. I spent the last 2 hours giggling like a little school girl and I couldn't be happier. There is nothing real about this movie but I don't think that's the point. Twelve years after its release its laughable at best but it will put a smile on your face the whole time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Someone in the videostore advised me to see this film. Now I understand that this probably was a joke. Skulls is terrible. It is not even funny for it's flaws. The acting is lousy though you must feel sorry for the actors because the screenplay is even worse. The story itself is a clich blue collar student gets an invitation to join some fascist fraternity which seems to secretly run this planet. The fraternity exists for about two hundred years but it's rituals are shallow and do not go beyond driving expensive sportscars having sex with supermodels and quoting the fraternity rules from a biblelike book which seems to be a mixture of Mao's Red Book and Hitler's Mein Kampf. The blue collar student completely dropps his old friends from the white ghetto  who conveniently for the story happen to be videoediting experts and own a surprisingly sophisticated mixing studio for the white trash they so unconvincingly try to portray but becomes remorseful when his formal best black friend get's murdered by his new Buddy's dad who is president of the fraternity but also a high court judge and a total maniac. When the hero tries to uncover the coverup he briefly ends up in a mental institution but is saved with in a day by this senator  who is also a skull's member and by his girlfriend who earlier in the film made a MacGyver like paint spraying robot. The film drags on to a most ridiculous ending. One of the rules of The Skulls sacred booklet states that you are entitled to challenge a fellow Skulls member for a duel with ancient guns. Till death that is. So we see our hero in a duel with his formal new buddy the buff but thickheaded son of the Skull's president. This troubled young bully kills his dad the maniac judge instead of our blue collar hero. The end.".

So far so good in a film that will appeal to teenagers doing higher education  but as soon as the secret society is revealed you might not have to read too far between the lines to think the film is pointing fingers in certain directions .

Anyone who's anyone wants to join and when Luke McNamara Joshua Jackson. a working class senior is accepted he is of course very excited. Once he joins he gets money power and he even gets told that The Skulls can help him attend any Law School he wants to go to. He wants to attend Harvard. Everyone who joins The Skulls gets a 'friend for life' and Luke gets paired up with Caleb Mandrake. The brilliant Paul Walker. Calebs father is one of the high chairmen of The Skulls. For while things are going great for Luke but when finds his best friend Will Hill Harper. Who wasn't happy about Luke joining The Skulls in the first place. hanged from his room and has allegedly committed suicide Luke realises that The Skulls is not all he thought it would be. So Luke with a little help from his friend Chloe Leslie Bibb. try to find out what really happened to Will and along the way they find out some other disturbing things about The Skulls.  The cast in the movie are all quite good. First you have Paul Walker he's brilliant in anything he does. You also get to see his gorgeous body here. Then you have Joshua Jackson he's quite good and then there's Leslie Bibb. Who on earth cast her? She's such an awful actress. She has that 'girl next door' thing going here but she really can't act. I can just about stand her in the TV show Popular but really. Oh well you just have to grin and bare it. Rob Cohen directs The Skulls and he does a GREAT job directing as usual.I would recommend The Skulls to anyone. If you like drama suspense thrillers etc. or if you're just a fan of Paul Walker than The Skulls is for you. I give it a 1010.".

If ever there was someone who had no chance in being a candidate it was Luke McNamara. But then Lucas' character is thrown in to show a contrast in the proceedings otherwise the film would have been unwatchable if it only concentrated in these boring rich boys.Films like The Skulls and other thrillers thrive in the paranoia factor that is created around the situation. In this case it shows how a few misguided individuals want to control everything where their members are influential figures. In this case it is the judge that aspires to be the next supreme court nominee something that has some actual interest since the president of the United States a secret society member himself has had to choose people to fill key vacancies in the government.The best assets of the film lie in the crisp cinematography by Shane Hurlbut who does wonder with his camera. The fine editing of the film by Peter Amundson shows outstanding quality that makes The Skulls a film that is easy to watch. Mr. Cohen has an eye for camera placement that shows in the different settings in the film.One wishes Rob Cohen luck with his next undertaking because she demonstrates he knows his craft well.".

Joshua Jackson plays a boy who enter in a secret sociaty The Skulls where he has marvelous cars  beautiful women and many other pleasures. But everything has a price so the pleasure turns in a psycologic thriller where the character prays to get out of the group.Behind the group there is a  murder that is connected with Joshua's friend. The film is very enjoyable of corse that there are some mistakes in the plot but that's O.K!!We understand!! Just watch the movie like a good distraction  don't judge everything be nice with this one. 8 out of 10".

Among his directing credits are Dragonheart and Daylight. Asides from Jackson and Walker living the life of total bull here there is wasted supporting work by Craig T. Nelson and Leslie Bibb. While many recent thrillers are laughable this pretty much takes the cake on stupidity. While a thriller about secret societies can be interesting this one is by the numbers and about as funny as a game of Checkers. It is a laughable teen horror film that should be locked in a coffin and never surface again. Score 2  10".

In the Skulls teen movies decide to take a look at secret societies.The film stars Joshua Jackson as Luke McNamara a young rower who wants to study for a law degree. But as a poor townie it's going to be an uphill struggle to finish unless a secret society known as the Skulls decides to make him a member.Of course they do make him a member. The first thing we learn about secret societies is that they endorse the buddy system and Luke is paired with Caleb Mandrake the late Paul Walker a boxer. Luke's room mate Will decides it would achieve something to break into The Skulls secret chamber and does so. Sadly all it achieves in doing is annoying Caleb who pushes Will down a ledge knocking him out. Caleb's father and Skulls bigwig Judge Litten Craig. T. Nelson tells his son he'll take care of it and orders some subordinates to kill Will and make it look like a hanging.Luke is pretty shaken up about his friend's death but not as shaken up as Caleb who believes he killed the man. The rest of the movie is pretty much Luke working out what happened to his friend with help from another senior Skull Senator Ames Everitt CSI's William L. Peterson and love interest Chloe Leslie Bibb. The ending is pretty satisfying without delivering anything unexpected.The Skulls is a bit ridiculous at times but it does work reasonably well in its own right. There's enough going on to keep you interested and the performers are all invested enough in the story to put out a sincere product. It is very much a product of its time but fans of the era should check it out if they are looking for a trek down nostalgia lane. Not essential viewing by any means but worth checking out if it comes on cable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another film that just makes you more afraid and non trusting of secret societies makes you wonder if they will ever make a movie that praises these groups. Well we have The Skulls which I watched today and I have to say that I wasn't so sure to trust this movie. We've seen the whole don't trust anybody plot a million times before. Joshua Jackson was so popular with his Dawson's Creek era and I wondered why they would put him in a lead role pretty much for the money. But I gave the movie a fair chance and wasn't too disappointed. It's very predictable and has some flaws to it but overall it does provide entertainment. The story has been done to death but beggars can't be choosers in this Hollywood.Luke McNamara is a college student with aspirations to eventually become a lawyer. He attends Yale along with his girlfriend Chloe and his best friend Will. Luke's friendships hit the rocks when he is invited to join a secret society known as The Skulls. As a member of the Skulls Luke is partnered with Caleb and the two quickly strike up a friendship. Eventually Will who has been conducting research on the Skulls for some time discovers their secret ritual room. Will gets caught in the ritual room by Caleb and in the ensuing struggle he falls and is knocked unconscious. Caleb is ordered to leave the room by his father after which one of Litten's cronies breaks Will's neck. The skulls manage to move the body and make it look like Will committed suicide in his dorm room. But Luke knows there's more to the story than it looks.The acting is alright for the most part Jackson does a decent job in the leading role. But they could have had someone who was a bit stronger considering that every line that Jackson said in the end was made for the trailer pretty much. Paul Walker again more used because he was just the hottie of the time he was OK. No major stand out performances Craig T. Nelson is the most cartoon villain I've seen in a while. The only thing that was missing was the lightening in the background as he's laughing manically at the Skulls meetings . But the film works on the story pretty well it keeps the tension even though there are unbelievable moments. I seriously love how this secret group is possibly going to be apart of the CIA or FBI one day part of the government top secret yet doesn't realize that when they murder someone they should check the room for security cameras. But the scares are captured with Joshua not being able to go to anyone to find help for his room mate's murder. It's hard to say if I would recommend this film it's just alright and average. I think there are some good moments and bad one's it's certainly flawed and made for the teens but I think the adults could find something good from the story. It just needed a little more work. 510".

If there is one thing I take away from this movie it has a classic last line delivered by William Petersen but you're gonna have to watch it to find out.";

Paula played by Hawn and Richard played by Reynolds are two of Hollywood's sought after screenwriters and they work very well together. After 3 years Richard decides that he wants to marry his livein Paula but Paula has been hesitant because marriage changes everything. To Paula everything is fine as is. How interesting that it's the man that wants a long term commitment and the woman doesn't! After convincing Paula marries Richard but in the worst way possible  she chooses a walk in chapel out of the phone book and the ceremony is done barely in English. Next the biggest problem facing the newlyweds is that neither has seen or spent any time with each others parents and they decide to visit each of them and spring the news that they got married in person.They trek on a cross country journey in true a Hollywood Screenwriters fantasy  via a cramped small train to visit Paula's parent's first in Buffalo and then Richard's in Virginia. The parents are not what each envision they are totally different and somewhat weird on occasion. Needless to say each set of parents and their families have Paula and Richard questioning what kind of person they actually married.Also thrown into the middle of this is that Paula and Richard are working on a screenplay that needs revision after revision. The Producer they are working with played by Ron Silver is the epitome of Hollywood Producers  he will say and act however he can  from lying about his child that may or may not exist to finally making real adult decisions  to get his movie done. What makes matters worse is that Paula and Richard have a total breakdown during their trip so the script revisions aren't done by a very tight shooting deadline.You don't have to know much about Hollywood screen writing to see that this is a story about two people who love each other but worked so hard that they didn't have time to let anybody else in. They seemed to be compatible they've known each other for 5 years total  2 years and then lived together for 3  who didn't really know each other at all. What they are learning is that their life does not fit into a neatly written screenplay format as they have obviously lived and controlled.

An absolute box office champion during the seventies and early eighties Reynolds lends all his charm claw and talent to his character. Goldie Hawn charming and provocative composes with perfection a woman whoin spite of loving Reynolds' character is afraid of getting married what may mean a precipitate step in the relationship. Jewinson one of the last real filmmakers from Hollywood accomplished a sweet and hopeful comedydrama about the ups and downs of every couple of lovers. The big surprises are the beautiful and nominated for an Oscar song called How do we keep the music playing? and the talented supporting cast that includes Jessica Tandy and Ron Silver.".

An absolute box office champion during the seventies and early eighties Reynolds lends all his charm claw and talent to his character. Goldie Hawn charming and provocative composes with perfection a woman whoin spite of loving Reynolds' character is afraid of getting married what may mean a precipitate step in the relationship. Jewinson one of the last real filmmakers from Hollywood accomplished a sweet and hopeful comedydrama about the ups and downs of every couple of lovers. The big surprises are the beautiful and nominated for an Oscar song called How do we keep the music playing? and the talented supporting cast that includes Jessica Tandy and Ron Silver.";

	schema:headline " When a film simply can't pick a genre and stick with it";
	schema:reviewBody "Norman Jewison's Best Friends is a hopelessly lost film and I think I'm going to leave it at that when it comes to trying to classify this. From the looks of the theatrical poster and DVD cover showing a happy and carefree Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn obviously engaged in romantic playfulness one would assume it's a romantic comedy when it's anything but romantic. One could call it a drama but there are too many incredulous sequences and silly inclusions of comedy to adequately and properly bill it as such and finally simply stamping the comedy label on it would be pretty disingenuous as well since the film is rarely funny. It's a film with a cynical if considerable idea that does nothing but spit in the face of anyone expecting any one of those three things executed on a competent level.The film follows Richard Babson and Paula McCullen Reynolds and Hawn a reliable screen writing duo who have worked together for years and have churned out successful quality screenplays for many different genres. They've also been living together with Richard suggesting the two get married and make their relationship official with Paula being hesitant to do so believing marriage is the root of all failed relationships. Despite her believes knowing how important marriage is to Richard Paula accepts Richard's advances and the two get married without telling anyone.Their honeymoon however is spent traveling to one another's parents' houses in order to inform them of the news. Paula's parents in New York get to hear first before the two fly down to Virginia to see Richard's family. The result is a groggy film with a premise that slithers by at a snail's pace so we can see the reactions of each person's family to a union we're surprised they didn't see coming in the first place. Did the parents not know that the two were living together to begin with? Did the parents not expect at least some certification of commitment between the two after years of collaborating and cohabitation? We don't know and that's one of the many problems with Best Friends. For as much as we're allowed to see we're not allowed to know very much about the characters and their dynamics which makes this film a very lackluster attempt at looking at marriage and the potential flaw with having socalled best friends marry one another. As the two wind up becoming more and more disgruntled with one another Paula begins to resort back to her original claims that marriage is the root of the evil which is flawed because of the fact that she agreed to the union and didn't have to if she didn't want to. With that the fault is not marriage in itself it's both Richard's for pressuring Paula into marriage and Paula for not taking a stand and affirming that this isn't what she wanted.But nonetheless we have to hear from Paula about how their disagreements and quibbles is the fault of marriage and over the course of onehundred and ten minutes watch this couple fall apart and resort to domestic harassment and violence. Where's the joy in that? For a film titled Best Friends with two strong actors at the helm not to mention a poster and premise that boasts a completely different story why is the end result so melancholic and miserable? Perhaps if the film had a direction or a more credible thesis as to why it felt that marriage was such a disparaging and flawed way to bring two people together then maybe there would've been some value. Unfortunately this is a meanspirited and downtrodden work for the sake of being both miserable and downtrodden and the end result is nearly two hours of arguments and repetitive echoes of previously disclosed sentiment all of which you can probably find at your own family's house without the need to go to the theater or rent a film.Starring Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn. Directed by Norman Jewison.".

They've also been living together with Richard suggesting the two get married and make their relationship official with Paula being hesitant to do so believing marriage is the root of all failed relationships. Despite her believes knowing how important marriage is to Richard Paula accepts Richard's advances and the two get married without telling anyone.Their honeymoon however is spent traveling to one another's parents' houses in order to inform them of the news. Paula's parents in New York get to hear first before the two fly down to Virginia to see Richard's family. The result is a groggy film with a premise that slithers by at a snail's pace so we can see the reactions of each person's family to a union we're surprised they didn't see coming in the first place. Did the parents not know that the two were living together to begin with? Did the parents not expect at least some certification of commitment between the two after years of collaborating and cohabitation? We don't know and that's one of the many problems with Best Friends. For as much as we're allowed to see we're not allowed to know very much about the characters and their dynamics which makes this film a very lackluster attempt at looking at marriage and the potential flaw with having socalled best friends marry one another. As the two wind up becoming more and more disgruntled with one another Paula begins to resort back to her original claims that marriage is the root of the evil which is flawed because of the fact that she agreed to the union and didn't have to if she didn't want to. With that the fault is not marriage in itself it's both Richard's for pressuring Paula into marriage and Paula for not taking a stand and affirming that this isn't what she wanted.But nonetheless we have to hear from Paula about how their disagreements and quibbles is the fault of marriage and over the course of onehundred and ten minutes watch this couple fall apart and resort to domestic harassment and violence. Where's the joy in that? For a film titled Best Friends with two strong actors at the helm not to mention a poster and premise that boasts a completely different story why is the end result so melancholic and miserable? Perhaps if the film had a direction or a more credible thesis as to why it felt that marriage was such a disparaging and flawed way to bring two people together then maybe there would've been some value. Unfortunately this is a meanspirited and downtrodden work for the sake of being both miserable and downtrodden and the end result is nearly two hours of arguments and repetitive echoes of previously disclosed sentiment all of which you can probably find at your own family's house without the need to go to the theater or rent a film.Starring Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn. Directed by Norman Jewison.";

	schema:headline " Death Becomes Her";
	schema:reviewBody "My Life Without Me shows off Sarah Polley's beauty and acting that has been clear to her fans since her Avonlea days. In writerdirector Isabel Coixet's first English language feature Polley takes what could have been a drippy maudlin story of a dying young mother and turns it into a cleareyed path to accepting early death and taking charge of the hand that's dealt you. This delicate view is in sharp contrast to Hollywood tripe like Sweet November where beautiful healthy women in denial die of Movie Star Disease. When Polley's Ann gets her death sentence from a doctor who can't even look her in the eyes she resolves among other items on her To Do Before I Die list to tell it like it is  but finds that instead everyone around her spills out their innermost problems and she doesn't get to including an amusing effort to get a Milli Vanilliloving hairdresser to cut her hair like she wants it. Perhaps it's because she chooses to lie to them about her imminent demise.  Not only does Polley get to use her fullfledged Canadian accent complete with Ehs but until I read it on her imdb bio I didn't know that when she was 11 Polley lost her mother to cancer so she must have had personal experience to draw on.  The imdb credits do not include that the script is based on a short story by Nanci Kincaid Pretending the Bed is a Raft with additional inspiration from a poem about a young women's death by John Berger who is thanked prominently in the credits.  The symbolism of Ann having met her husband at the last Nirvana concert is also played upon several times. The music selections are lovely both the romanticsounding European ballads from one character's sister's DJ mix tape and the original music by Alfonso Vilallonga that are poignant and keep out the schmaltz. Polley's supporting actors are wonderful from the lively children to Amanda Plummer who has been MIA from films for a while and Debbie Harry as the depressed mother. There's a couple of resonances of the TV show Felicity as not only does Ann leave voicedover audio tapes to her loved ones but yikes even dying Ann gets both gorgeous sensitive hunks Scott Speadmen and Mark Ruffalo to love her. It's effectively shown though that one was the love of an adolescence that ended too soon with parental responsibilities and the other of her tooshort adulthood.".

Today there is a tremendous buzz over Scarlet Johansson assuming she didn't waste it all on The perfect score which hadn't been released in Israel yet. But Scarlet is not the only member on the ever growing list of actresses in their 20's with the maturity I'll probably never have and I'm entering to my 30's other actresses that pop into mind are Piper perabo Lost and delirious Maggie Gylenhaal Secretary Mona lisa smile and Thora Birch American beauty Ghost world to name just a few.In this film a new actress named Sarah Polley she has the filmography many veteran actresses wish to have emerges successfully from the pernicious world of child acting into a mature woman for her age which is coincidentally the basic premise of the character she portrays.Ann is a 23 year old mother who is notified that because of a malignant tumour her death is near. Ann decides after her initial shock maybe the best scene in the film to accomplish a couple of assignments before passing away one of which is to conceal the fact of her illness from her family in the rationalization of sparing them the endless hours of waiting in hospital friendly corridors and consuming hospital gourmet food. Ann spends the last two months of her life patching things with her long incarcerated father develop a romantic fling with a pensive heart broken guy Mark Ruffalo and looks for an agreeable sucssessor mother to her family among other things. This film has the idea and the cast to make it one of the best films 2003 had to offer but somewhere along the line the emotional charge that this plot encompasses never comes to full exploitation and i found myself wondering if the movie's writerdirector Isabel Coixet i have no idea how to pronounce this name in her attempt to make the movie optimistic and not just outright depressing wrongfully decided to avoid emotional obstacles in her script and her direction. Another detail that bothers me in the film is what I refer to as the Hollywooditis decease. This decease is a terminal one but those who get it look absolutely great until the very last day of their lives. I don't pretend to be a doctor but it seems to me that a person with terminal cancer can't explain hisher fatigue simply by Anemia Ann's cover story.But I dwell on the negative and in films its usually a dumn thing to do. The right thing to do is to make the overall judgement the film is undoubtly good Polley's performance is excellent and Debby Harry Blondie's lead singer is surprisingly good but the movie leaves the viewer with the feeling it had the potential of being a masterpiece which it isn't.8.5 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter".

	schema:reviewBody "The young Ann Sarah Polley has a simple but happy life with her husband Don Scott Speedman and her two daughters Penny and Petsy. Ann works as a janitor in the nightshift cleaning the rooms of a university Don builds swimming pools and they live in a trailer in the backyard of Ann's mother. When Ann goes to the doctor expecting to be pregnant she is informed that indeed she has a terminal cancer lasting a maximum of two weeks. She hides the information from her family and prepares for her death making a list of ten outstanding subjects in her life including preparing tapes for the birthdays of her daughters until they are eighteen years old eating and drinking whatever she wants telling only the truth finding a new wife to her husband visiting her father in the penitentiary and making love with another man. When I started seeing this movie I immediately recalled Michael Keaton's My Life. But indeed only part of the storyline regarding a terminal ill person preparing for the death is similar. It is impossible not adoring My Life Without You. The first point for loving this movie is the outstanding direction of Isabel Coixet and performance of the cast having inclusive the uncredited and magnificent participation of Alfred Molina as the father of Ann in one of the most touching scenes along the film. I do not know the criteria of the Academy to select the nominations for the Oscar but I believe Sarah Polley deserved at least a nomination for her acting. The story although dealing with a delicate theme is very beautiful sensitive positive and never corny due to the sensibility of Isabel Coixet. The two young girls Jessica Amlee and Kenya Jo Kennedy are amazing being very natural and convincing in their performances. The soundtrack with sad but lovely songs completes this wonderful film. I have never heard about Siamese babies of different sexes but I am not sure whether it is possible. My vote is eight but I am not sure whether I am being fair.Title Brazil Minha Vida Sem Mim My Life Without Me".

	schema:reviewBody "At first when I saw the IMDb score and read the synopsis I thought this will be a great movie... And for the first 5 or 7 minutes I had this impression. But then the movie started to slowly kill my hopes. This is a movie about a girl who discovers she is going to die and so she decides to go out and punish the whole world for it including herself. There's a thin line between moving and pathetic. And this movie is about pathetic people not unfortunate poor struggling people. First she starts off writing her list of things to do before I die like telling her kids she loves them more often finding another woman for her husband going to the beach with her husband going to see her dad who's in jail smoking and drinking... But the following is where the list goes a little mischievous 1 Record birthday messages to her 6 and 4 year old daughters until they're 18 If they can move on let's make sure we turn each and every birthday a depressing occasion of remembering mom is dead 2 Have sex with other men to see what it's like she lies to the husband who she seems to love about going to die and cheats on him too no harm in that too!! 3 Make someone fall in love with me She seems to be in love with her husband and keeps telling him she loves him but then she wants to torture another man by making him fall in love with her while she's supposedly happily married and also... DYING!So on top of her list is to tell her girls she loves them everyday but instead of wanting to spend what's left of her life with her loved ones she leaves them with the neighbor who has just moved in after a 5 minute talk to go and screw the new guy's life. I can understand if people decide to become a little selfish when they realize there's very little time on their hands but to decide to be mean to her mother to cheat on her husband to lie to another man and make him fall in love with her and to ditch her girls with a total stranger is just pure nonsense when the plot tries to convince you she's sacrificing for everyone's sake!There almost isn't anyone who's normal in this movie. A pathetic work colleague who's obsessed with diets and food as in literally talking about dietsfood in every scene she appears on. A pathetic grandmother who tells her grand daughters creepy stories and whines about her life in a super pathetic way. A pathetic waitress in a coffee shop who wishes to win the lottery in order to transform her looks to look like Cher! A pathetic boyfriend who has absolutely no furniture God knows why! A pathetic father in jail who sews shoes and asks the daughter he hasn't seen in years for her daughters' shoe sizes. And ultimately a pathetic dying 23 year old girl who wastes entirely all the time left in her life over things that cannot even qualify to be labeled wishes to say the least. This is it about the plot and the characters. The script is weird creepy and makes no sense interrupted by irrelevant pathetic emotionless voiceover. The acting is terrible you can hardly sense any emotions from all actors. Like when she receives the news of her terminal cancer so she weeps for a few seconds then asks the doctor for a piece of candy! The movie is so boring moving slowly between unreasonable events to eventually meet the inevitable very expected and disappointing end. I really can't get my head around why this movie scored 7.6 on IMDb!".

	schema:reviewBody "When Americans make bad films at least they are big and slick and full of CGI. This is what you get from Bad Canadian Heavily Government Subsidized filmmaking  an insufferably unrealistic look at a young woman dying of ovarian cancer and how she spends her last few weeks.There are some fine actors here Sarah Polley Alfred Molina Amanda Plummer and I can't imagine how they got talked into this. Apparently no one involved  actors director producers script writers  has ever even read about ovarian cancer but they simply pulled it out of a hat. I lost my best friend to this disease and I am outraged at how its portrayed here.A movie doesn't have to be a blowbyblow depiction of realism but this goes far beyond ridiculous. Diagnosed at 23 with stage 4 metatastic ovarian cancer which has already spread to her liver and stomach but Ann Polley is still full of energy pretty sexy and able to work a fulltime night job.

You can NOT diagnose cancer from an ultrasound  you'd see the tumors of course but have no way of knowing if they were benign or malignant. No MRIs no CAT scans...gee I heard that Canadian National Health insurance was skimpy but this is ridiculous.Instead of undergoing radiation and chemo normal treatment even if you are terminal this can prolong your life Ann is given some miracle pain pills and sent on her way....not before the EMERGENCY ROOM doc agrees having met her once for 10 minutes that he will send her cassette tapes of messages to her daughters on their birthdays every year...for fourteen years!!!!! Yeah I am sure he's going to obligate himself to a total stranger for that long...obviously he doesn't treat any other terminal patients.Having decided to make a list of what she wishes to accomplish before she dies in a couple of weeks no concern for how sick she will be Ann chooses a lot of vain and silly selfish things  the chief of which is that she will have sex with a man besides her apparently deeply devoted loving handsome and sexy husband Scott Speedman in a thankless role and make that new man fall in love with her. Fortunately the ever ready Mark Ruffalo is SITTING AT THE NEXT TABLE and immediately fulfills her needs. My isn't that convenient. And isn't it nice that she has the energy sexual desire and NO PAIN that will make a vigorous new sexual relationship even possible while she is dying from terminal ovarian cancer....Other posters have commented on the funniest bit in the whole film when Ann scouts out a woman for her husband to marry after she is gone apparently he will have no choice in the matter and locates a nurse who has moved in RIGHT NEXT STORE good thing she is young and pretty and not fat and fifty. The nurse relates quite seriously a tragic story about a pair of dying Siamese twins  A BOY AND GIRL!!!!  which is of course absolutely scientifically impossible...which any medical professional would know...this absolutely kills anything what little is left of believability. At first I thought this was gonna be a longwinded joke but no it was told absolutely straight as a tragic story. The friend I was watching with and myself literally fell on the floor in howling fits of laughter. Which made being sad at the rest of the film impossible. I can only wish my friend who passed away from this horrible disease could have seen this as laughter is the best medicine. Perhaps she is giggling helplessly on the other side.One of the worst films I have seen in recent years and an absolute pieintheface insult to anyone WITH cancer or who loves or has lost someone to cancer.".

	onyx:emotionText "When Americans make bad films at least they are big and slick and full of CGI. This is what you get from Bad Canadian Heavily Government Subsidized filmmaking  an insufferably unrealistic look at a young woman dying of ovarian cancer and how she spends her last few weeks.There are some fine actors here Sarah Polley Alfred Molina Amanda Plummer and I can't imagine how they got talked into this. Apparently no one involved  actors director producers script writers  has ever even read about ovarian cancer but they simply pulled it out of a hat. I lost my best friend to this disease and I am outraged at how its portrayed here.A movie doesn't have to be a blowbyblow depiction of realism but this goes far beyond ridiculous.

	schema:reviewBody "My Life Without Me stars Sarah Polley as Ann a twentythree year old young lady from Vancouver British Columbia whose married and has two young daughters named Patsy Kenya Jo Kennedy and Penny Jessica Amlee. She's married to a contractor husband named Don Scott Speedman and they reside in a trailer out in the back of her mother's Deborah Harry yard. After noticing physical changes to her body and weight her introverted but kindhearted doctor Dr. Thompson Julian Richings that she has aggressive ovarian cancer and that she may only have about two to three months left to live. Feeling to keep this situation to herself without anyone knowing about it or getting the proper treatment she needs to at least stall the illness from getting worse she instead writes up a bucket list of things she wishes to achieve before she succumbs to an eternal bliss. She programs a lifeplan for her children and leaves numerous recording of birthday wishes until they're eighteenth birthday. Her list leads up to a visit from her incarcerated father Alfred Molina and has a relationship with another man Mark Ruffalo. Written and directed by Isabel Coixet this film is based on a short story Pretending the Bed is a Raft by Nanci Kincaid Ann is a strong proud woman who wants no sympathy from anyone keeping her disease lowprofiled and just wants to continue living the life she had before the bad news erupted almost like it never happened. But the emotional level will manifest with you the entire film which makes watching this film a little painful to endure. Coixet refrains from making this film fall into the deep streams of melancholy integrity no matter how sad this movie really is and does everything in her power to keep us from reaching into our tissue box to dry our eyes. Sure we feel the pity for Ann but we also praise her for the decisions she makes though it can be quite foolish at times. But she manipulates her audience into not to feel overtly sad when her death draws near while not encouraging every decision she has planned out for her. In a way My Life Without Me' can be like a comingof age film about a woman finally given the things she always wanted to do but never had a chance in her youth. She got pregnant when she was in her midteens her husband was the first man she ever kissed. His job seems at times on and off and money is very tight while Ann is a janitor at a local college. She never had the opportunity to experience youth because these chains of events held her back and she has missed out on a lot.Her bucket list seems at times quite logical like recording birthday messages to her daughters until they reach the age of 18 she believes her neighbour Lenore Watling would make a great wife for Don she pays a visit to her incarcerated father one last time she also wants her hair and nails fixed and even goes as far as to take up drinking and smoking. She also wants to experiment adultery by sleeping with another man behind her family's back which is quite absurd. The man's name is Lee Mark Ruffalo who she sees very often privately and never once reveals that she is dying.There are many scenarios that seem to to at times lack in a harmonious fashion. Sure there are some quirky characters that contribute to the much needed comic relief from this rather sentimental story. Others are really of no special purpose. Amanda Plummer plays Laurie's friend and coworker who has a fixation about her weight and dieting and Portuguese actress Maria De Medieros was wonderful as The Hairdresser who seems to be attracted to Milli Vanilli I wonder why?. Sure Ann's motives are inspirational but can at times be selfserving too. Coixet can't seem to parallel these two configurations though Sarah Polley was very convincing in her performance. Her curiosity to find youth was uplifting but as always it's family comes first.".

She have two little daughters and a loving husband. After getting the news that she has only two months to live she make some interesting decisions. First of all she refuse to get a second opinion and she refuse any treatment. Her initial reaction is to sit cry a little bit then ask for a candy. Her next action is to write an obligatory things to do before I die list on which she put things which I can split to following groups1. Predictable she decide that she'll tell her daughters that she love them every day visit father in Jail have a picnic with family and say what she's really thinking. We don't see much of this in the movie.2. Shallow get some false nails do something with hair smoke and drink as much as she want. Those are the most interesting things she can imagine when she know she have only two months on this earth? How sad3. Silly find Don husband a new wife and record birthday messages for her daughters for every year until they eighteen. I don't understand why looking for a new wife for husband? He's not retard he's good looking caring young man obviously he can find a new wife. And I suppose he should be able to choose her himself when he feels the time is right. And why create some sad crying messages which her daughters supposed to listen on every birthday until they're eighteen!? Wouldn't that be kind of a depressing on birthdays? Why not just tell the family what's going on and allow them to go through this with her?4. Selfish make love with other men to see what it is like make someone fall in love with her. She have so little time to live yet she desires not to spend it with family but rather seek an affair in which one of her hopes is that not she but the other person will fall in love with her. Why? She's already very much loved her husband is portrayed as such a tender person if he find out what she did he'll be hurt her daughters will be hurt. The person who she have an afar with if he'll indeed fall in love with her will be hurt at the end. She herself will be hurt. Hurting whole bunch of people just so that she'll satisfy her ego and see what it is like.And this is how the movie is above all we just watch her running to her new lover  even if that means leaving kids with a complete stranger and constantly lying to husband. We don't see how she's dealing with sickens because beside throwing up occasionally there's no signs that she's actually sick. We don't see that she'd be dealing with any mental challenges concerning the fact that she'll soon die  her challenges are above all those of any adulterer not being caught finding time to see lover.But even for a movie about adulterer this one is very shallow as she's facing no moral dilemma whatsoever. All seems so natural for her almost as her family wouldn't consist of real people but rather soulless dolls being there purely to play a side role in her life. Funny enough this is what her new lover becomes very soon too. So she's selfish shallow controlfreak unable to care about or love anyone but herself. Well my guess would be then that her illness must be some karmic balancing  hopefully in next life she'll learn to be a bit nicer.".

	schema:headline " A woman searching for her identity";
	schema:reviewBody "What I've always enjoyed about this film is that once you get past all the slapstick and Jewish American Princess jokes you find the story of a sheltered young woman seeking her identity and independence. Judy Benjamin has been raised in a very coddled existence believing she can do nothing and that her only value is to be someone's wife or attached to a person in some way. When her husband dies on her wedding night she foolishly joins the army where her inability is played for laughs. But this is not what the film is really about in the long run. When her parents come to retrieve her Barbara Barrie as Judy's mom is literally holding the pen showing Judy where to sign. To me this scene is very believable. It's as if Judy finally realizes that she has set herself up to fail. She decides to stay and proves that she can do a good job she just believed she couldn't.Perhaps my perspective is different because I saw this film first in 1980 when I was 18 years old but I still enjoy it to this day. I can overlook the portions that are not very PC by today's standards. It was after all a different world then. I find Goldie Hawn's performance to have great comic timing and believability. Eileen Brennan is memorable in her role even though it is a bit stereotypical by today's standards. Barbara Barrie and Sam Wanamaker are hilarious as Judy's parents and Robert Webber is unforgettable as Col. Clay Thornbush. I will always enjoy this film perhaps always from a different viewpoint.".

It's as if Judy finally realizes that she has set herself up to fail. She decides to stay and proves that she can do a good job she just believed she couldn't.Perhaps my perspective is different because I saw this film first in 1980 when I was 18 years old but I still enjoy it to this day. I can overlook the portions that are not very PC by today's standards. It was after all a different world then. I find Goldie Hawn's performance to have great comic timing and believability. Eileen Brennan is memorable in her role even though it is a bit stereotypical by today's standards. Barbara Barrie and Sam Wanamaker are hilarious as Judy's parents and Robert Webber is unforgettable as Col. Clay Thornbush. I will always enjoy this film perhaps always from a different viewpoint.";

But I never really had an interest in this film but my mom told me what a great comedy it was and that I should give it a chance. So finally today I got some time and watched it and I'm glad I did. Private Benjamin is a great comedy staring then new comer Goldie Hawn. I didn't realize how much she was meant for comedy I've seen some of her work like Overboard and Death Becomes her but usually she has the supporting cast helping her in the comedy this time she was on her own and did great.She plays Judy Benjamin a 29 year old whose been married twice her last husband died on her literally had a heart attack while he was making love to her. So since she has always been taken care of a stranger helps her out and recruits her in the army showing her the AFTERMATH of what she could have in the future but she thinks that she's getting all the good stuff immediately. Therefore she becomes the princess of the boot camp but after a harsh talk with her folks she realizes she needs the army and to become strong. She ends up meeting a suave French man and gets transferred to Paris after graduation but she soon realizes who she needs most in life herself.Private Benjamin is a great comedy that I think anyone could get a little kick out of. It has great jokes and fun moments that I had a good time watching. Not to mention Goldie Hawn is just so adorable and you definitely want to keep rooting for her during the film she's just great.710".

Perhaps the best example of this is when she and her army friends are sitting around the campfire smoking pot and she tells them the story of how her second husband died on their wedding night. One of the friends played by Mary Kay Place says gravely I don't get it. What does a person do after something like that? After a beat Goldie Hawn responds Join the army and they all burst out laughing.I believe that this movie has withstood the test of time but maybe that's because I'm pushing 50.".

Goldie Hawn is made for this kind of role and as usual delivers the goods. There are some genuinely 'laugh out loud' moments as she struggles to adapt and make friends. Unfortunately the film seems to run out of steam half way through. Whereas the first half is true comedy the second half has very little in the way of humor to offer. Having met a French gynecologist who she falls for she wangles a posting to Paris to be with him. This is where the humor disappears as Judy leaves the army to be with him and he turns out to be a control freak that turns Judy into a clone of his ex girlfriend. It's almost like watching two separate films. I think it would have been better if the whole movie was her in the army not broken into basically two parts one distinctly comedic and the other a love story. Still despite some glaring flaws Private Benjamin is a good movie with a good story to tell. Unfortunately what was probably a pretty daring look at gender rolls for its time has gotten really stale. If you overlook that though the movie is very entertaining.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Goldie Hawn is absolutely adorable in this perhaps her signature role. Goldie plays Judy Benjamin a spoiled young Jewish woman who we first see at her second wedding. Judy is in her late twenties and has done seemingly nothing of importance in her life. Her father is only interested in her finding the right guy so he doesn't have to support her anymore. It seems she has found at least a successful husband in a man named Yale. Albert Brooks Yale seems like kind of a sleaze but at least he has a good job as a divorce attorney and Judy will at least be able to live off him for the rest of her life... it would originally appear. Those plans are shattered 15 minutes into the film when Yale dies while the two are having sex on their bathroom floor. Having nowhere else to turn after an eight day bought of selfpity Judy lets a charming army recruiter talk her into enlisting. Quite simply put things are never the same for Judy Benjamin ever again.The middle of this movie deals with the now Pvt. Benjamin stumbling through basic training. The concept of a misfit having trouble in this situation has been done many many times throughout the history of films. There are indeed some laughs but nothing like you find with Bill Murray in Stripes for example. Eileen Brennan is outstanding as Capt. Doreen Lewis who is out for Benjamin's scalp from day one. She gets some of the best lines and the more we find out about her the stranger her character appears to us. We also see Benjamin have to deal with a Colonel who tries to rape her at 13000 ft. during a skydiving exercise. Through it all Hawn shines like.... well... gold I suppose. She is beautiful funny and she adds a new layer of dignity to her character with every scene.The final half hour deals with Judy Benjamin going back to life as a private citizen after having to quit the army. She is first transferred to a base in France then moves in with a Gynecologist whom she had a one night stand with during a weekend leave earlier in the film. It seems this doctor had previously joined the Communist Party to impress a former lover and the Army makes Benjamin choose between him or them. This gynecologist wonderfully played by Armand Assante is pretty much a paper scarecrow. He obviously is not faithful he wants her to sign a prenup before they get married and basically tries to run her life. Considering how much she has changed since the film's outset you can see the conclusion coming from a mile away.Overall this is a pretty good film. Not as funny as others dealing with misfits in the Army but still funny enough. Hawn is good enough to make us care about her not only as a soldier but also as a person before and after her stint in the military. Great supporting cast members also add to the film's charm.The final shot is memorable but a little puzzling. After removing her veil and tossing it to the wind Judy Benjamin walks off into the distance in her wedding dress. Just where in the heck was she headed? The airport? 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

She gets some of the best lines and the more we find out about her the stranger her character appears to us. We also see Benjamin have to deal with a Colonel who tries to rape her at 13000 ft. during a skydiving exercise. Through it all Hawn shines like.... well... gold I suppose. She is beautiful funny and she adds a new layer of dignity to her character with every scene.The final half hour deals with Judy Benjamin going back to life as a private citizen after having to quit the army. She is first transferred to a base in France then moves in with a Gynecologist whom she had a one night stand with during a weekend leave earlier in the film. It seems this doctor had previously joined the Communist Party to impress a former lover and the Army makes Benjamin choose between him or them. This gynecologist wonderfully played by Armand Assante is pretty much a paper scarecrow. He obviously is not faithful he wants her to sign a prenup before they get married and basically tries to run her life. Considering how much she has changed since the film's outset you can see the conclusion coming from a mile away.Overall this is a pretty good film. Not as funny as others dealing with misfits in the Army but still funny enough. Hawn is good enough to make us care about her not only as a soldier but also as a person before and after her stint in the military. Great supporting cast members also add to the film's charm.The final shot is memorable but a little puzzling. After removing her veil and tossing it to the wind Judy Benjamin walks off into the distance in her wedding dress. Just where in the heck was she headed? The airport? 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.";

	schema:reviewBody "Oh dear.  This is a difficult film to say generous things about.  It has funny moments but they are few and far between.  It holds itself out as a satire on Jewish life especially the materialism and the limitations of the complacent middleclass Jewish American lifestyle ... but when Judy Benjamin who claims to have rejected her parents' values is resisting Henri's amorous advances she learns that he is Jewish and wealthy and immediately succumbs.The early scene in which Jewish princess Benjamin complains to Captain Lewis Eileen Brennan is funny but thereafter the military training is a long long extension of one joke  namely that Benjamin isn't very good at drill.  However as is always the way with these boot camp movies the rookies bond and overcome their tribulations and all goes well.

	onyx:emotionText "Oh dear.  This is a difficult film to say generous things about.  It has funny moments but they are few and far between.  It holds itself out as a satire on Jewish life especially the materialism and the limitations of the complacent middleclass Jewish American lifestyle ... but when Judy Benjamin who claims to have rejected her parents' values is resisting Henri's amorous advances she learns that he is Jewish and wealthy and immediately succumbs.The early scene in which Jewish princess Benjamin complains to Captain Lewis Eileen Brennan is funny but thereafter the military training is a long long extension of one joke  namely that Benjamin isn't very good at drill.  However as is always the way with these boot camp movies the rookies bond and overcome their tribulations and all goes well.  That Benjamin should be sent to a cushy Paris posting is even allowing for the plot point that brings it about hard to believe.The 'Thorn Birds' segment is weak.

	schema:reviewBody "One would believe with the talents of Goldie Hawn that Private Benjamin would be a comedy smash hit. While it has its moments it falls short of the mark needed for a great movie.The first half is good. Goldie Hawn's Judy Benjamin lives a ritzy social life. Judy is the spoiled pampered princes who faces uncertainty and confusion about her future when her husband in an all too brief occurrence by Albert Brooks Yale dies on their wedding night.Depressed downtrodden and seeking selffulfillment. Judy decides to join the Army after visiting her local recruiting office. She is told about how wonderful the Army is and decides to try it. Judy is convinced that the Army is like it's advertised on TV with yachts and exciting adventures.Predictably Judy struggles through basic training with a mean drill sergeant. The other women in her platoon squad at first resent her but gradually warm up to her pulling pranks on the drill sergeant and laughing at Judy's jokes and campfire stories about her life. Goldie does a fine job with the material here. However the script IS predictable and strained. The last good part of the movie is the Thornbird's parachute training sequence to the song The Battle Hymn of The Republic. Than the movie falls apart in the second half. After basic training Judy's squad is recruited to France where she reunites with family and friends at a bar. She quickly falls for a French man and the movie becomes a mess. It's never really explained why Judy would have feelings for such a man. At this point the story almost becomes a totally different movie where the viewer no longer cares and just wants the movie to end. A rapid wedding is planned but before the ceremony Judy comes to the realization that the Frenchmen was just using her. He insults her she responds by decking him than says don't call me stupid and walks out of the church a liberated woman.It is as if the writers ran out of the good Army material in the first half of the movie. Than they sloppily tacked on Judy's relationship to the Frenchmen because they needed to stretch the movie for another half hour. The lesson here is you can't just take what would have been a good movie had it focused on Goldie Hawn in the Army exclusively and tack on a subplot that makes no sense and offers no explanation for why it's there other than to add time to the picture.What could have been a 710 movie gets downgraded to a 510 because of this. There is not enough good story plot in Private Benjamin for it to succeed as a fulllength movie.".

The premise is comedy gold. Who wouldn't like a snobby selfcentered person put into hisher place by the military. The thing is Private Benjamin only partly delivers on the promise of an endearing comedy. The first half of the film is solid entertainment filled with funny gags. However the second half was stale and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth that diminished the overall quality and effectiveness of the movie.When Yale Goodman Albert Brooks dies after marrying his wife Judy Benjamin Goldie Hawn Judy decides to enlist in the United States Army. The Army recruiter Jim Ballard Harry Dean Stanton paints her a picture about a wonderful life in the Army. But when she arrives to basic training it is anything but that pretty picture. Now she must survive from the likes of her captain Doreen Lewis Eileen Brennan and the commander of the Army's elite paratroopers Clay Thornbush Robert Webber.If the movie only had a focus on the first half this would have been a great movie. Judy who always has been dependent on other people her entire life really gets a rude awakening when she arrived at camp. That scene where she was trying to explain that she signed up for the army but not this army to Captain Lewis and her fake understanding was really funny. I bet she loved cleaning those latrines! Watching her struggle through basic training is comedy gold. Whether it's crawling in the mud or going over brick walls she has come to realize perhaps she made the wrong decision to join the military. The interactions between Captain Lewis and Benjamin may be the only reason to give this movie a watch.Then Clay Thornbush entered the picture. We abruptly go from a story about basic training to a segment about an older man making sexual advances on Judy. These scenes were meanspirited and didn't make sense. Then we have illogical sequences featuring a romance between Judy and a Frenchman played by Armand Assante. The whole postbasic training part of the movie was messy incoherent and did not fit well with the first half.This premise is the perfect premise for a comedic talent such as Goldie Hawn. In fact Nancy Meyer's script was tailor made for her. Her character was made to be annoying at times but Hawn did well with what she was given. But there is one performance that stands out above the rest and that is Eileen Brennan as Captain Lewis. It's nice to see a female portray a toughasnails drill instructor. Not only is she tough but she adds fake sweetness to her toughness. The chemistry she both Brennan and Hawn had is worth every penny.Private Benjamin could have been a better movie if only it stuck with the basics. The first half was a welldone farce about military basic training but the addition of notneeded characters and some rather abrupt personality changes took down the movie several notches. I was surprised how the movie was nominated for three Academy Awards. Sure maybe Eileen Brennan deserved her nomination but I do not think Goldie Hawn was good enough for a nomination and definitely not the screenplay. That being said I still laughed from time to time and had some fun.My Grade C".

	schema:reviewBody "Bill Condon working with his own material has come out with a movie that serves to illustrate how the work of Dr. Kinsey awoke the American public to a better understanding of their sexuality in ways no one up to that point had ever dared to show. As he proved with his other film Gods and Monsters Mr. Condon shows he doesn't mind tackling adult themes so scarce in the present cinema.The film is documentary in style as we are shown the life of Kinsey at different times of his life. He had an unhappy childhood. His father was a tyrant who never really showed love toward him. There are moments when the young Kinsey is shown as boy scout and there is an element of homosexuality that maybe for fear never came to the surface but it's there nonetheless.Dr. Kinsey's life takes a turn when he meets Clara McMillen who he calls Mac. It's with her that he begins a life of discovery in the field of human sexuality that was taboo in American colleges and universities at the time. Albert Kinsey was the first one that spoke about the things that were never said in polite company or in the classroom up to that moment.

	onyx:emotionText "Bill Condon working with his own material has come out with a movie that serves to illustrate how the work of Dr. Kinsey awoke the American public to a better understanding of their sexuality in ways no one up to that point had ever dared to show. As he proved with his other film Gods and Monsters Mr. Condon shows he doesn't mind tackling adult themes so scarce in the present cinema.The film is documentary in style as we are shown the life of Kinsey at different times of his life. He had an unhappy childhood. His father was a tyrant who never really showed love toward him. There are moments when the young Kinsey is shown as boy scout and there is an element of homosexuality that maybe for fear never came to the surface but it's there nonetheless.Dr. Kinsey's life takes a turn when he meets Clara McMillen who he calls Mac. It's with her that he begins a life of discovery in the field of human sexuality that was taboo in American colleges and universities at the time. Albert Kinsey was the first one that spoke about the things that were never said in polite company or in the classroom up to that moment. His life was dedicated to understand what made human beings act the way they did never being judgmental but with a tremendous insight to interpret the data and present it in a comprehensible way.A puritanical American society reacted strongly against the findings of Dr. Kinsey.

	schema:headline " Sex sex sex sex sex and oh yeah sex....";
	schema:reviewBody "We've got a couple of hours before dinner time for a couple of sex surveys. Who wants to go first? This line from KINSEY is a great representation of the movie. It illustrates the film's offhanded sense of humor and shows that the otherwise taboo topic of sex is tossed about in a way that can be seen as being either casually shocking or mundanely trivial. And logically enough numerous scenes do happen at the dining table sex researcher Alfred Kinsey as played by Liam Neeson chatters about sexual statistics over family backyard cookouts with his teenaged children regales guests with graphic details of sexual minutiae at elegant affairs and ultimately ends up becoming a crashing bore at dinner parties as his compulsion to ramble on about all things sexual dominates his every conversation and waking thought. What begins as a healthy interest and a professional curiosity becomes a tiresome obsession. In a way Kinsey becomes a sex addict but in a scholarly detached sort of way. He's like a sports nut who's neither a player nor a spectator but loves to collect the memorabilia and obsessively keep track of trivial statistics. He measures his sexual conquests less by the number of his bed partners than by how many people he seduces into answering his probing sex surveys. Research itself becomes a sexual fetish.A disturbing or at least revealing aspect of the film is the implication that Kinsey seemed to blur the line separating the personal and professional in his pursuit of carnal knowledge. There is a scene where Kinsey and his assistant Clyde Martin Peter Sarsgaard go to a gay bar to round up people to interview and various men treat his request to answer questions as a joke assuming that the survey is really a cheesy come on. And they might not be entirely wrong. Watching the film one gets the feeling that Kinsey had a substantial sexual appetite both physically and intellectually. The film suggests more than it reveals but it hints that the lingering concerns over Kinsey's moral and ethical behavior might reflect more than just a germ of suspicion. Though the film tries to memorialize Kinsey as a social pioneer it doesn't shy away from nor does it condemn his dubious breaches of ethical standards such as encouraging intramural sexual activities among his staff and their wives. At one point Kinsey interviews a creepy subject played by William Sadler who has maintained a detailed record of all of the thousands of people he has had sex with including children and the implication is clear that he and Kinsey are two sides of the same coin  both justifying their amoral pursuits in the name of intellectual enrichment.Throughout the movie all things sexual are treated comically and seriously trivially and ponderously casually and obsessively. But only fleetingly is sex treated erotically. The film is graphic about sex but in a textbook sort of way not a pornographic way. Even the few sexual scenes involving Kinsey and his wife Laura Linney seem designed to illustrate an academic point coming off as being more like classroom visual aids rather than moments of passion. The film delves into the good doctor's bisexuality but gingerly treats it with equal reticence. Indeed though a bit of full frontal nudity is supplied by Sarsgaard he ends up putting his pajamas on before sharing an intimate kiss with Neeson. Perhaps the film's only moment of real sexual tension comes from two Boy Scouts discussing the sins of self gratification. And they end up praying! The film is mostly all Xrated talk with only a bit of PG13 action. And the talk isn't even all that graphic it just seems that way compared to the traditional  skittish  way films always approach the subject. If the film has any point it is that even though we have come a long way in dealing with sexuality we still haven't gone all that far political correctness having joined religious piety as a form of censorship. Kinsey worked to bring the most private of all human endeavors into public discourse not realizing or caring that most people would still rather have it continue being  literally  private intercourse. As such KINSEY still carries a certain shock value and the ability to milk much of its humor from its often embarrassingly blunt approach. And humor may be the film's saving grace. Though towards the end the story takes on the usual air of selfimportance that plagues most film biographies writerdirector Bill Condon refuses to let the film become too heavyhanded. Some of the humor is a bit obvious such as picking John Lithgow to play Kinsey's pompous father a fundamentalist preacher in a performance that echoes the actor's similar role in FOOTLOOSE. But for the most part the humor humanize the characters and doesn't present them as crusading icons or symbols of enlightenment. Like most film biographies the honesty of KINSEY as history is debatable as are the doctor's contribution to the health and welfare of the society. But as a film KINSEY is like good sex a briefly satisfying mix of passion and amusement.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read some of the reviews on IMDb before I went to see the movie. And I was struck by some of the negative comments it received. Even in this day and age there is a doublestandard on moral values.Hypocrisy vs. common sense. The movie cleverly reveals that Kinsey helped us along the way to become open about such a basic but nontheless extremely vital part of our existence. True some of his subjects were pedophiles or engaged in sex practices that most people would find offensive. However the knowledge that he as a scientist derived from his studies is immeasurable  it enables intimate insight into the human psyche and with that possible treatments for those that are sexually victimizing others. And this is the key point the law should protect life the innocent underaged and animals and of course the nonconsenting. Other than that sex is something between consenting adults and noone should have the right to outlaw what you do in the bedroom. If you listen closely the movie will give you the same message. My only complaint is perhaps that on the subject of perversion they barely scratched the surface on Kinsey's personal response. It was clear that as a scientist he would continue on the path of knowledge however dark it may have been. I would probably agree that the movie version of his life and work was toned down to a pill small enough to swallow  still I feel it shows the audience enough to get a picture of who this man was.Don't expect adult entertainment when going to this movie. There is little that will cause an openminded sexually in touch with himherself adult embarrassment or even excitement. It's more like a documentary. The acting was superb on everybody's part and Academy Award Nominations will be forthcoming  no doubt. Hopefully they will take some wins home.".

	schema:reviewBody "WriterDirector Bill Condon does a thoroughly detailed fascinating study of the life of famed sex researcher Alfred Kinsey in the drama Kinsey. What would on surface seem unfilmable is done with great sensitivity and honesty.Condon knows how to tell stories about real people Gods and Monsters and here is a life filled with curiosity and far reaching accomplishment.Raised in a repressed family dominated by a stern father Kinsey is portrayed as an isolated teen who rebels against not only his father but against sexual convention. As a science instructor in college he meets a student who becomes his wife. As other students look more and more to him for sexual advice his original interest in insect studies changes to sex adviser and ultimately sex researcher. His team of assistants and even their wives become involved in the research. As Kinsey's study requires sample interviews across the country a diverse amazing discovery of sexual habits and statistics are revealed. The study ultimately becomes published in a groundbreaking best seller amid a swell of damnation from the public.Condon interweaves the science with the human element in a very intelligent screenplay. It is remarkable that such a coherent storyline emerges from a multitude of scientific and news sources. The movie also says a lot about the state of the country at a time in mid twentieth century America when the Red Scare was in full swing and the populace was guided by the morals and sensibilities of its time. Kinsey's relationship with his wife is the thread that ties the film together thematically. She essentially becomes the barometer for his work and his shortcomings. Here is a man who was brilliant and at the same time fallible.There is no epilogue at film's end as might be expected for a biography but it is a nice touch for a film that tries to approach its subject with freshness and reverence. The set design and costumes are all authentic in period flavor but the film seems to be focused not on marking the precise year but depicting an era or time. Do stay for the amusing end credits which show a veritable Noah's Ark of animals in their glory. Liam Neeson is very good as the obsessed scientist who tries to conduct meaningful quantifiable research while reconciling the emotional toll on his marriage and his friendships. Laura Linney is in fine form as the supportive wife who observes and then participates in her husband's venture.As his research assistants Timothy Hutton Chris O'Donnell and Peter Sarsgaard round out a very strong ensemble cast. In fact these fine actors are almost wasted in supporting roles. John Lithgow is pitch perfect as Kinsey's cruel insensitive father. There is a nice near cameo appearance by Lynn Redgrave Gods and Monsters as the last interview of Kinsey and she resonates in her brief appearance.In keeping with the subject matter there is graphic dialogue and sexual depictions but there is nothing exploitive or without narrative purpose here. It is interesting to note that this film is coming on the heels of a moralistic backlash of media content and permissiveness. By showing how wellintended human studies into formerly taboo subjects helped to enlighten and reexamine human behavior Kinsey proves to be the right film for the right time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just as the focus of Kinsey thought he was being objective about a topic that had only been treated subjectively the film is not an objective biopic. For the first half of the movie the exquisite production design costumes and makeup effectively recreate middle America before World War II as Kinsey's rigid upbringing and equally rigid scientific life as a zoologist are established. Laura Linney as first his student then his wife adds an earthy and warm element and her excellent acting adds womanliness beyond the script to the movie that is missing otherwise. Their gradual move into teaching and studying sexuality is shown convincingly in contrast to the prigs around them with ironically surely Tim Curry playing his puritanical academic rival. Accurate details include showing and reading from a popular marriage manual Theodoor H. van de Velde's Ideal Marriage Its Physiology and Technique when I ran a used book sale at my local synagogue we would get many unread copies donated from now elderly couples who had received it as part of premarital rabbinical counseling and it was hilarious how sexist and inaccurate it was. But writerdirector Bill Condon takes considerable interpretive leaps as he moves on to the inner circle as T. Coraghessan Boyle terms it in his fictionalized interpretation when Kinsey hires trains works and lives closely with male assistants for his first research project on men. Peter Sarsgaard is the stand out in the trio as outstanding as his role in Shattered Glass and as all holds barred as in The Center of the World. But his characterization leans toward a cavalier attitude towards women that is emblematic of this film until literally the last minute. I don't see why his character would be jealous to the point of fisticuffs of the attentions Timothy Hutton's flirtatious assistant would be paying to his wife when he seemed to condescend to marriage only for appearance's sake anyway. The film dwells on gay men and skips through the research done to produce the second tome on women pointing out mostly Kinsey's corrective biological information therefore gliding over how it was the revelations about women that shocked the nation and led to difficult political and other consequences though Margaret Sanger and Emma Goldman had promulgated similar information about women decades earlier and had been hounded out of the country for their efforts. The Kinsey Institute's FAQ on their Web site point out the active partnership of female research assistants for this work who simply don't exist in the film. And the Congressional investigations of foundations in the 1950's didn't just focus on the Rockefeller Foundation's funding of Kinsey but they haven't yet posted their correctives on their Web site. Similarly as Kinsey is shown taking the leap from taxonomy to adviser as an avatar of the coming sexual revolution the psychological component of relationships let alone sex only comes up once such that Liam Neeson's characterization ultimately seems naive. But Condon is more interested in the political component as he clearly sees a similar tide of conservative criticism rising across the land again. One also gets the feeling that someone either read the script or saw a working print of the film and had to gently point out to Condon that women simply get short shrift so suddenly an extremely poignant coda is added with Lynn Redgrave as a very moving interviewee on how Kinsey's work affected her life directly. The aging makeup and cinematography are beautiful in indicating the passage of time matching seasonal passings and making early discussions seem to have been documented in black and white. The casting of the many research subjects is wonderfully varied and the New York metropolitan area locations recognizable only to the cognoscenti stand in very well for varied cities academic and sylvan locales. The closing credits are surrounded by fun period songs and zoological interactions.".

Superb acting assists too with Neeson and Sarsgaard both in good form however it is Linney who shines the most as Kinsey's wife. But what gives the film such an extra boost is how confronting it manages to be. It is a daringly different film packing the punches and managing to even have a few good laughs. The style feels unique yet the technical aspects of the film are rather ordinary. It is a bit too uncomfortable to watch at times also but it generally succeeds.

	schema:headline " The next best thing to talking about sex with body language";
	schema:reviewBody "Back from a muchtoolong hiatus after 1998's masterful character study of James Whale Gods and Monsters writerdirector Bill Condon gives us a slightly more conventional biopic of important and sadly controversial scientist Alfred Kinsey. I say sadly controversial because I despise puritanical attitudes about sex in modern cultures much more than Kinsey is shown to in this film. Compared to my views on ethics in general and sex in particular Kinsey could have been a poster boy for the Moral Majority.Kinsey is portrayed by Liam Neeson who turns in one of the best performances of his career. Condon starts the film with a clever exquisitely realized montage that alternates Kinsey training his team of assistants at the beginning of his sex research days in the late 1940s with flashbacks of Kinsey's childhood up until the time when he was a young adult. The scenes of Kinsey training his research assistants are in black and white and have a slight look of 1950s science documentaries without the scratchiness and bad splices that some of us can remember from watching old filmstrips at school. The flashback scenes are presented in lush color with mostly subtle and gorgeous cinematography. A shot of a young Kinsey looking through a spyglass framed against a cloudy sky is just one of many examples of cinematographer Frederick Elmes' strikingly poetic work. This is all set on a bed of typically stunning pensive music from Carter Burwell.The sequence is designed to emphasize some of the background and motivations at least from the nurture side that eventually fueled Kinsey's infamous work. His father portrayed by John Lithgow who unfortunately can't be in the film more it must be a relatively minor part of the film as Condon has made it is shown as a religiously staunch moralist espousing antiquated often superstitious views on sexuality and preaching of the evils of sexual expression in society. We see from the start that Kinsey has a voracious scientific curiosity and a love of nature. The combination of interests and influences leads him to drop out of the tech school at which his father is a respected teacher and study biology at a university instead.We enter the beginning of Kinsey's professional career which he dedicates to studying the gall wasp. He goes to unusual lengths to collect a huge number of specimens in an attempt to attain a kind of ultimate objective empiricism. At the same time he meets and falls in love with Clara McMillen Laura Linney who becomes his wife. Both Kinsey and McMillen are woefully uneducated and inexperienced when it comes to getting physical as they disturbingly learn on their honeymoon it even causes enough problems to lead them to a physician not long afterward. We also see a couple other events emphasizing a general paucity of accurate sex educationinformation in the culture.It takes awhile to get through all of the above and some viewers might feel a twinge of impatience when are we going to get to the sex stuff?a cry also frequently heard whenever there is mixed company but Condon through selective biography has tied all of Kinsey's background together with no superfluous details in what functionally becomes a clever argument suggesting that the only thing that Kinsey could have done in his later years was to study sex in the way that he did.Condon and Neeson easily paint a complex picture of Kinsey as a sex researcher. Kinsey seems to have an innocent naivety a scientific thoroughness and objectiveness and a worldly libertine disposition on ethics all at the same time. These all catalyze what eventually became controversial workand it was often controversial in the eyes of others in each of those modes due to the existence of the other modes in Kinsey. In my view this is maybe most interesting from the scientific modeCondon's film goes far in showing that personality and individualistic quirks inevitably have an effect on science despite the popular mythology about that field which has it as more of a dispassionate even robotic endeavor. Of course reactionary fervor from various morally conservative groups and those who wanted to keep various morally conservative groups in their good graces was the eventual undoing of Kinsey and Condon shows this in the film while amazingly managing to not seem overly polemical.Of course Kinsey is a characterdriven film that largely stands or falls due to its performances. Besides Neeson and Lithgow the other principalsprimarily Linney and Peter Sarsgaard as Kinsey employee and intimate Clyde Martinare excellent in demanding roles.But Kinsey also has a surprising amount of unusual and exemplary technical aspects. The interesting cinematography continues throughout. A long sequence of Kinney traveling across the country and interviewing all different kinds of people is refreshingly different and effective especially as floating heads recede in the frame like passing highway dividing lines before quickly morphing into each other.The makeup which has to age the principals 30 years or so is masterfully doneat beginning of the film you'll find yourself saying Geez Liam Neeson John Lithgow et al look young for their age and at the end Geez they look old for their age. In both parts of the film the cast looks like they really must look just as they do at that moment.If I had to pick on something as less than satisfactory it would be a backhanded criticismCarter Burwell's music seems a bit underused throughout the middle section of the film. When that's the extent of the negative criticism it means you need to see the film. Moreover it's important socially for everyone to see this film now. For whatever reason Puritanism keeps rearing its evil little head in modern cultures. Kinsey can help remind us of more rational not to mention healthy satisfying fun etc. perspectives.".

However he has a certain spark a certain sense of purpose an unformed restlessness which makes him not just stumble across the surface of these walls but climb over it see the other side and realize that there is a world of information and experience out there just waiting to happen. Of course this has the nasty habit of occurring at a time when such questionings come with the syndrome of skepticism not unlike the kind Noah faced when building his Ark.Alfred Kinsey is one of these people. Coming into a society which believed that masturbation was not only a sin but could cause blindness or hairy palms or that homosexuality was a perversity and an act against nature he discovered through a massive exhaustive investigation where he interviewed people from all walks of life that men and woman were much more complicated than initially thought although such a concept was around for years. Nevertheless it took an investigation with scientific characteristics to validate it.. Masturbation was and still is a very popular practice. Approximately 37 per cent of men have had at least one homosexual experience and of those a third would choose exclusive homosexuality a third would remain in the middle and another third would move onto heterosexuality  he rated all this on a scale from 0 to 6. Premarital sex is common. Women come into marriage knowing nothing about sex. The missionary position was not the only position of choice.What made Kinsey's investigations so cutting edge was the fact that he dared to bring all these findings into light where anyone else would have simply not thought about such things for fear of losing their reputation. On top of that it's no secret that controversy in itself is a concept we created to pin onto a subject deemed too risky Kinsey's findings were no different than Galileo's deduction that the Earth was round. But thanks to his studies homosexuality has taken giant steps to being considered less offensive and just another orientation even though many countries and some American states still have a lot of intolerance on the matter.A movie like KINSEY does good in showing both the good and the bad sides of the man because only a person who had this intensity of vision could produce such results at the risk of almost losing not only his immediate family he comes close to on at least one occasion but friends and associates. No intent is made to glorify or romanticize its main character and the film itself at times seems like an extended course on sex education courtesy of PBS especially in a sequence involving a frigid woman played by Kathleen Chalfant but there are moments of comic relief and dramatic moments interspersed that break the extreme intellectual nature of the movie. One of them involves a scene in which Kinsey and one of his male associates played by Peter Sarsgaard discover their attraction to each other which leads to Peter Sarsgaard also disclosing his attraction to Kinsey's wife and colleague Clara wonderfully played by Laura Linney. Clara's move from being the supporting wife who is disturbed in finding her husband is having a sexual tryst with a male colleague to being quite open to having her own tryst with this same man is revelatory as well as the funniest point of the entire film. More enigmatic though is Kinsey's reaction to having his wife also experiment sexually but then the film is more interested in focusing on the story from an impartial view than reverting to the predictable recriminations. After all coming from Kinsey they would have been out of character anyway and Liam Neeson is effective in not conveying too much but just enough. Telling though is his compassionate expression when confronting his father John Lithgow proving he's one of America's finest actors in an interview that reveals so much about his extreme conservatism and denounces the tradition of parental abuse.And as an ending note it has to say something that after everyone has left funding has stopped Clara and Alfred remain married to the end of their lives looking back at their own body of work and hoping that they've done the best. Time the constant healer and ultimate holder of the Truth has had its say sex education has become a part of our own development and as Kinsey's last interviewee Lynn Redgrave  a closet lesbian who finally came out to a female she pined for  After I read your book I realized how many other women were in the same situation. ...

	schema:reviewBody "Kinsey indeed did the nation a favor when he published his studies of the sex habits of the American male and female and the nation finally got a chance to see what was actually being done sexually versus the repressive conventions of the times that had many people believing that they were sexually abnormal. However if the facts of the movie are largely true it seems that Kinsey fell victim to the same basic fallacy as Ayn Rand. Kinsey seemed to believe that just because something  in this case sex  can be described and studied objectively that it can and should be practiced objectively. For example Kinsey plunged into a homosexual affair with his assistant  with his wife's full knowledge  because he wanted to explore a side of himself he felt he had been repressing. His wife seems quite hurt by the revelation but later she embarks on an affair with the same assistant when he tires of her husbandapparently with Kinsey's encouragement. Maybe this worked for the Kinseys but for most people this type of behavior would break a relationship. It also seemed odd that Kinsey was as insistent and preachy about adults being sexually liberated as his father had been with the opposite viewpoint ultimately alienating his own son just as his father had alienated him.In the long run Kinsey's work was key to decriminalizing all kinds of sexual behavior that had been considered deviant up to that time. Because as Kinsey states Everybody's sin is nobody's sin. And everybody's crime is no crime at all. This film was a very balanced and frank biopic of Dr. Kinsey in my opinion.".

However if the facts of the movie are largely true it seems that Kinsey fell victim to the same basic fallacy as Ayn Rand. Kinsey seemed to believe that just because something  in this case sex  can be described and studied objectively that it can and should be practiced objectively.

	schema:reviewBody "Sexual intercourse was something that was perfunctory for purposes of procreation and was left intact under those circumstances until a person named Sigmund Freud came along. Freud's rudimentary experimentation with psychoanalytical behavior relevant to sex as well as other intense emotions brought on copious mores of conscious thoughts pertinent to the individual's taboo elements of their constitution such as the libido and the id!! By the late 1920's in America Freud's elementary findings on sexual behavior motivated Alfred Kinsey to initiate research that purported the yearnings of many people nationwide about exposing their intimate desires concerning sex!! The revelation of such proclivities made Kinsey a phenomenon in sexual research after World War II!! Many people were mesmerized and intrigued by the Kinsey Report!!! Alfred Kinsey a biologist by trade was determined in his desire to attain a grass roots recognition of the myriad of actions that were predicated on impetuousness!! This movie's basic plot revealed Kinsey's desire for the exposure of the lewd endeavors and double entendre habits which afflicted many different people!! Such a depiction of this individual known as Alfred Kinsey sparked a milestone in sexual knowledge to the mainstream American public!!Liam Neeson did a tremendous job of acting as the role of Kinsey!! The entire film evoked a candid admission concerning lustful desires. If there were no such thing as desires about sex with so many people Kinsey's research would not have been considered a breakthrough!! The film also points out that Kinsey's ideological binges with his research were often times halted by a lack of funding!!! Much of Kinsey's findings resonated to hedonistic wishes much of them also translated to blatant intimacy!! Novice excursions with sexual deviancy made Kinsey and his wife educationally curious!! Attaining knowledge through various experimentation that both Kinsey and his wife engaged in transcended infidelity and callous fruition and relegated the two of them to the precarious plight of the ultimate guinea pigs!! These were emotions that were not sanctioned by love rather they were motivated by capricious lust!! Intellectual rumination on the motives of socially adverse carnality invoked a plethora of academic findings for Kinsey!! The end result of such research made Kinsey an unmitigated madman for the acquisition of perverted information!!I found this movie to be very consciously significant...It was very socially sensitizing especially in terms of the comprehension of the dogged tenacity Kinsey had to expose the perplexing facts about sex!!! A critical component to unearthing facts about an issue such as sex was merely to talk about the issue of sex!! This film depicts Kinsey's determination to attain knowledge about the historical importance of research and development germane to human sexual behavior which altered the lifestyle patterns of American living!! The cinema accommodated provision to the movie audience for Kinsey's findings that were in fact revolutionary floodgates that opened the formulation of the attitudes people have today!!

	schema:headline " Enjoy the performances of Liam Neeson and Laura Linney";
	schema:reviewBody "Liam Neeson is a terrific actor and Dr. Alfred Kinsey is his character. After seeing Kinsey I can't imagine anyone else better for the role. People usually say that I know but you couldn't possibly imagine anyone else playing the part ever. I think Neeson has a strong chance at winning an Oscar this year as does Laura Linney playing Kinsey's wife a terrifically kind warm woman trying to keep up with Kinsey's life which moves along pretty fast. Too fast for her at times. These two performances are awesome two of the actors' best the Academy and every other awards show would have to be insane not to mention them.Unfortunately I don't think the rest of the movie is really up to par with the performances. Not to say it's bad just that it fails to really interest us when Neeson or Linney aren't on screen which fortunately doesn't happen much. The movie is about Alfred Kinsey who pioneered the research on human sexuality. Neeson shows him as a strong man but one with as many flaws as the gall wasps he collected all buried deep beneath his drive and focus.Kinsey's studies proved some things and let a lot of homosexuality and other deviances from the norm at the time out into the open. I'd just like to say that I agree with some of his studies I like that he unlocked the way uptight supposed morality of the masses think that any sexual behavior other than the missionary position is both unhealthy and immoral. How they thought that I don't know but I admire Kinsey for proving them wrong. Other things I do not agree with like Kinsey's studies on the time it takes really young children to reach orgasmand Kinsey's way of thinking that sex on its basic level should have no emotional attachment I think I can say that these things are ethically wrong without feeling ignorant.But I won't be biased against the quality of the film because of this. I will speak of the technique of how it was made the writing the directing etc. I liked how the movie began with a black and white practice interview between Kinsey his wife Clara and their students. It is intercut with scenes from Kinsey's youth Kinsey facing temptation with masturbation and having trouble with his insanely strict father John Lithgow.Lithgow's first scene where he speaks of the temptation and evil caused by zippers electricity and ice cream parlors is the film's first problem. It doesn't show both sides of Kinsey's argument it merely dismisses Lithgow  and those like him  as a laughing stock instead of considering any validity in points that they're making.This problem is carried throughout the movie and Lithgow is seen as such a monster that we feel no sympathy for his character in a later scene showing his inner weakness and tragic past the scene feels thrown in and very foreign to the rest of the movie.I think the opening scenes with Kinsey and Clara first falling for each other and his proposal and collection of gall wasps are the movie's best I believe. Once Kinsey starts his research on sex I think the movie becomes a bit conventional. We get the usual scenes such as Kinsey alienated from his family Kinsey receiving trouble from his financial backers Clara feeling alienated from Kinsey and so on. Of course most of the time we watch eagerly because Neeson and Linney are awesome but we still have that itching feeling that the film isn't as special as Ebert says.What I mean is after decades of biopics especially this year a biopic has to be more than conventional. Unless the lead character is amazing and extremely watchable like in Ray the film needs to show us something new. I mean when you see a biopic you pretty much know the lead is going be alienated from his family obsessed with his work and full of inner demons. So give us something else please.Problems also arise with the introduction of Kinsey's staff including bisexual Clyde Martin Peter Sarsgaard Wardell Pomeroy Chris O'Donnell and Paul Gebhart Timothy Hutton. The problem is we hardly know any of these characters so we are bored when they get into arguments because we don't feel that we know anything about them. When we find out that Martin is bisexual it comes as a surprise but we react with a shrug. Sarsgaard's performance is surprisingly flat that he's getting any buzz for awards surprises me.I'm giving the movie a seven simply because of the professionalism Neeson and Linney display on screen. They are the acting pros they wash the floor with the rest of the cast. The Academy voters will all be struck by lightning if either isn't mentioned. So see it for them and about the rest well shrug.710".

Attempting to cram 70 or more years of someone's life into 2 hours or less is impossible to do well in my mind and that's why films such as A Beautiful Mind never work. They feel glossed over. Focusing as I have said before on a single portion of a man or woman's life makes for much better film see Ed Wood or Baaadaaaassss! or Auto Focus.

There are the expositive early years his scientific breakthroughs his ascent to scientific superstar as one of the first sex doctors his obvious fall from grace and his recrudescence. It's exactly no really EXACTLY like every movie about a real life figure you have ever seen.It really rankles me that something trite like Kinsey or Ray gets endless amounts of press. They're not innovative new or different. They're actually the same friggin' movie come to think of it. The same formula  man attains great heights falls and rises again. It's not fun. I sat watching Kinsey knowing what would come next. Look at the clock  oh an hour has passed? He'll probably hit the big time soon. Only fifteen minutes left must be time for redemption. This is absurd. I'm sorry someone needs to grow some cojones and tell these directors that they're boring us. The only good thing about a movie like Kinsey or Ray is that it makes me want to go out and read a book about these guys learn about them understand them. The movie biography is the cinematic equivalent of Cliffs Notes. It's all shorthand undercooked tripe. I should actually stop comparing Kinsey to Ray. Kinsey is much worse. Ray though standard fare as far as biopics go was blessed with great photography it didn't you know look like a made for TV movie as Kinsey does and an utterly galvanizing performance by Jaimie Foxx. Liam? He's all right but he's always all right never impressive. Laura Linney who I love was given very little to work with and did an admirable job though I felt much of the time that her heart wasn't in it. My favorite performances came from Peter Saarsgaard who is fast becoming my favorite young actor Timothy Hutton he needs more work! and Chris O'Donnell who oozes charisma and also needs more work but they were criminally underused maybe because they were walking away with the movie?. Which brings up another point characters would appear and then disappear  what happened to the Kinsey kids ? why introduce them and make them seem to have some importance if they're not going to reappear? why have name actors O'Donnell and Hutton play such small roles? why give Saarsgaard a larger role but fail to develop his character? why not give Laura Linney any character at all? Who the hell is Al Kinsey anyway because I just spent two effing hours watching this movie and I don't feel at all like I get him and I'm not dumb so it wasn't like I missed it I mean really? Not that the movie is all bad. There's male full frontal nudity and closeups of vaginas.Also what happened to Tim Curry who is an absolute joke in this movie. Wasn't he at one time a wonderful actor? Frank N. Furter how far you've fallen.".

The fact that this movie received a 7.7 only confirms my belief that the majority of people in Western society are so debauched and poorly educated that they will swallow any crap that is dished up for them in a sugar cone. Many of the situations in this movie were remarkably inane  such as Kinsey interviewing his Father at his Mother's funeral regarding his masturbation history. Please. My wife and I walked out.

Jones Kinsey intended to use science to attack Victorian morality and to promote an ethic of tolerance. Moreover he had a personal stake in seeking to overturn traditional morality for he was a bisexual voyeur who engaged from adolescence onward in increasingly violent masochistic masturbation. But Condon takes this a step further creating a rightwing conspiracy. Yes Kinsey was subjected to criticism but his harshest critics were not the WitchHunters but statisticians who were appalled by his methodology and intellectuals who were aghast by his view of human nature.The vast majority of the public readily bought Kinsey's conclusions. Indeed he was portrayed in the mainstream media as a courageous researcher seeking to enlighten the masses. But don't tell Condon that  he's too busy throwing Alan Gregg under the bus. In the movie Gregg is this stickinthemud who turns his back on our hero in his time of need. In fact Gregg never wavered in his belief that Kinsey was a man of absolute rectitude. Did he have the slightest inkling his Rockefeller Foundation was unwittingly picking up the tab for Kinsey's home movies? Hmmm.Anyway I was bored. John Lithgow as Liam Neeson's father?! LOL! And Condon is SO predictable! When Rice declares that the Negro has a harder time keeping it in his pants Condon cuts to  you guessed it  the black guy! He then discredits Rice by having the students crack gay jokes! What is Condon who is gay trying to tell us? Hmmm.How about the paradise he envisions once his Jesus delivers us from the evils of Victorian morality? At a party a Kinsey flunky excuses himself with a cheerfullygraphic remark about his state of arousal. Degradation perversity AND no class! Nice!Neeson's Kinsey is a selfrighteous whiner. When the Foundation pulls the plug he mutilates himself! That's real mature! We're never told that he developed a massive pelvic infection as the result of his practices hastening his death. Why? Because would that actually validate those Condon mocks for warning of the dangers of promiscuity and  worse  torpedo his and Kinsey's agenda? Hmmm.".

It ignores how he employed pedophiles to molest these children and record their screams and convulsions in soundproof rooms. It ignores his sadomasochism his genital selfmutilations which led to his death and steers away from his pioneering work for NAMBLA. He considered JudeoChristianity the enemy of freedom. He sought to invest sexual relations between humans and animals with a certain dignity suggesting they could achieve a psychology intensity comparable to that in exclusive human sexual relations. Dr. Judith Reisman Kinsey Sex and Fraud p.7.Kinsey is reported to have favored sex with children at any age having concluded children are sexual from birth.

The whitewashing of this despicable guy makes any other comment on the film absent of integrity. I was surprised Liam Neeson took the lead role in light of a script that revises historical fact. I guess I expected better of him as a person if not an actor. As an actor he could have demanded more truth.The acting is soso the script is soso. It's the fact it has sexual content that will raise voting scores to exaggeratedly high levels here.All of which means it's another likely Oscar contender from the Left.These kinds of films often get high marks from reviewers who don't want to look prudish by dinging them.".

	schema:headline " Movie with an agenda and not particularly accurate";
	schema:reviewBody "Viewers who did not live in the 1940s and early 1950s will be taken in by this very shallow treatment of a complex subject  sex. The movie has a definite agenda and it is not about Dr. Kinsey and it distorts much to make its agenda.One would believe from watching this flick that Kinsey was the pioneer of the sexual revolution in this country. He was not. He rode the wave and exploited it. World War II was something of a coming out party. Many men learned much about sex during the War. Then under the GI Bill they went to college and that resulted in a much more sophisticated and liberal America. Early in 1947 a movie was shown all over the country. It was called Mom and Dad. It was about the problems of teenagers having sex and the possibility of getting VD. The photographs were very graphic and nothing like this had ever been shown in theaters before. The showings were restricted to persons 16 years and older and patrons could buy two pamphlets one about males and one about females. They were probably the first sex manuals ever widely distributed in the US. While very rudimentary they gave many people an idea what sex was all about.That was several years before Kinsey but at that time it was recognized that there was a lot of ignorance about sex although the ignorance was not as deep as depicted in the movie. For example the movie implies most people were ignorant of oral copulation. However it was practiced much more extensively than shown in the movie but because it was considered dirty people normally did not discuss it although it was often the topic of conversation among lower class men such as eating hair pie.The movie overemphasizes the teaching of abstinence. While the clergy and military chaplains preached abstinence it was not taught in health education classes nor in VD programs in the military. All servicemen were taught to use condoms and condoms were commonly used as a birth control measure. Most teenagers knew to use condoms to protect against pregnancy.While Kinsey shocked many people with his books particularly prudes many were not surprised. He just confirmed what many already knew. But he made mistakes. He overestimated the number of men that had engaged in homosexual sex. At that time many considered masturbation and mutual masturbation as homosexual practices and if there were people who if asked if they had engaged in a homosexual act would answer in the affirmative when in fact they had never engaged in oral or anal sex. This was brought out in later studies however because it didn't fit the message of this movie this mistake was not brought out in the movie. Further while some of subjects had engaged in one homosexual act more out of curiosity than anything afterwards they felt it was repulsive and never again engaged in a homosexual act but Kinsey never brought this out.The movie blatantly states that Kinsey himself engaged in homosexual sex but that has never been verified. Some consider it just another effort by gays to make him one of their own just as they have attempted to do with Abe Lincoln.A problem with the movie was that it sensationalized sex by showing pictures of sexual weirdos. It only detracted from the movie and made Kinsey look like a jerk.His research while flawed was done in a scientific manner. A true scientist but he lacked the ability to see beyond the data. He came to the conclusion that any sexual conduct was natural and therefore acceptable. He was advocating free sex. But he was an entomologist not a sociologist. He was incapable of seeing what the impact of his thinking would be on society and he lacked an understanding of how all the sexual mores had been developed and why.Surprisingly he did not understand the role of sex in a complex society. As an etymologist he should have understood how sex is regulated in the insect world. Examples are the ant and bee societies where sex is very restricted in the common good.The problem Kinsey and many other free thinkers have is that they believed that the mores against free sex were based on religion. In fact it is not the case. The mores against adultery sodomy and homosexuality actually were the result of pragmatism developed from thousands of years of wisdom and they are evidence of a highly developed society. Our ancestors learned early on that diseases were sexually transmitted. They learned that sex outside of marriage created severe family and social problems so their societies developed rules against sex outside of marriage including homosexuality. At the time the religious leaders were also the leaders of society and by making such conduct sins they became enfolded in religion. But any pragmatist can see the value of such mores in societies.Extramarital sex still remains the principle source of venereal diseases and of broken marriages as well as the source of many children born out of wedlock who don't have a family. The sexual revolution which Kinsey helped promote has resulted in serious problems for society as a whole. Prior to the Viet Nam War sexually transmitted diseases were limited to three easily treatable diseases and they were not that prevalent. Today as a result of free sex and a drug culture that resulted from the sexual revolution the number of venereal diseases had more than doubled and they are either ultimately fatal or difficult to treat because they have become resistant to antibiotics.If Kinsey had dwelt on how to improve sexual relations in marriage he would have accomplished much but by reducing the human race down to a basic sexual animal he helped destroy thousands of years of accumulated wisdom and unfortunately the movie fails to bring out the evil he caused.".

He had an overwhelming compulsion to stay the course to see the project through to completion even when that meant spending thousands of hours capturing and sorting hundreds of thousands of items the final project being the most comprehensive study of sexual behavior ever undertaken. Secondly however below the surface he seemed to need to and took evil pleasure from exposing society's most hidden shameful behaviors just for the shock value. Dedication to his first compulsion resulted in our having a far better more honest understanding of natural human sexual behavior. Indulging his second compulsion however greatly undermined the efficacy of that effort. Kinsey and Harvard Behavior Modification psychiatrist B. F. Skinner in their studies it seems to me suffered from the same shortcoming. They ignored deeply anchored motivations in favor of focusing exclusively on shortterm stimulationresponses. Worse they assumed these surface motivations were all there were. Skinner never addressed the capacity of humans as perhaps distinguished from other animals to create their own values based on each person's unique understanding of the world and resulting motivations. Similarly Kinsey myopically divorced the physical act of sex from the massive layers of psychological support that build up to it. There is no onenight stand I submit. Claim as they will that they are only interested in a goodtime tonight in relieving their built up sexual appetites participants in sex have deep seated yearnings for the act to result in bonding. If there is no repeat it is because one finds an essential ingredient of continuing the bonding process to be missing. For failing to factor in this essential motivation Skinner tell us lots about what people do but nothing about why they do it. Infidelity for example. When the unattached sleep around they are merely continuing to shop not yet having found a satisfactory bonding. In contrast what we call infidelity is really the evidence of a breaking of the bonding not the cause of it. And of course because sex itself is a bonding the extramarital sex accelerates the separation process. While the movie Kinsey makes this point nicely several times over the notion seems to have escaped the man himself.".

He was not a saint or a sinner he was just a man trying to advance human knowledge.Go see this movie then decide whether this was a good man. Don't let anyone tell you that Alfred Kinsey was a monster. He made human mistakes by his own admission.Alfred Kinsey was just a man trying do scientific research.Great performances by all.Edouard B.

	schema:reviewBody "As a biopic of controversial Doctor Alfred Kinsey this movie uses some very clever montages. Kinsey's earthshattering publication Sexual behaviour in the human male is based on interviews and interviews and interviews. Throughout the movie crisp flashes of these interviews are used not only to punctuate important points being made but also to move the story forward. For example the progress of Mr. and Mrs. Kinsey's sex life from nearignorance to total uninhibited enjoyment is shown as a series of cryptic alternating answers given by them to interview questions. Very clever.Indeed Kinsey almost stumbled across his success by the need to rectify an inadequacy in knowledge. The newlyweds both virgins flounder on wedding night because of very minor and common physiological problems which are easily rectified by a visit to a professional consultant. When the roles are switched and Kinsey tries to counsel a young couple he finds himself totally frustrated because he can't meet their challenging questions with authoritative answers. He just knows he is right but cannot prove things such as say masturbation will not cause brain damage. As an intellectual and an academic he recognises that the world is sadly in need of scientific literature on the subject of sex. The only way to fill this scientific gap is research Kinsey concludes conducted by interviewing people about their sexual behaviour. The rest is history.The macro aspect of Kinsey's research dominates the movie until the very end when we see Kinsey totally dejected but not defeated by the hostile public response to his research reading letters from people pouring out to him their woes. Feeling helpless in his desire to help them he comes across one interview that restores him. A downtrodden woman played superbly by Lynn Redgrave tells directly to Kinsey her affecting story of isolation and alienation until his book comes along and changes her life for her. Inasmuch as his book helps this women her story in turn helps him by allowing him to see behind macro statistics a face of a fellow human being for whom he has done something.By all indications the story has been told truthfully with Dr. Kinsey portrayed first and foremost as a dedicated scientist. While we see his love for his wife as well as a transient homosexual relationship with his research assistant he is for the most part impersonal. This lack of personal feelings is examplified in his encouraging free sexual relationships among his staff even including his wife as part of the research. Although he himself barely survives the aftermath some of his valued research team members come off embittered. Also his lacking in social and publicity skills plays a part in attracting public hostility which in turn fuels the forces that led to Rockefeller Foundation's withdrawal of its grants.Liam Neeson has accomplished a very challenging task of making this complicated controversial man believable and likable and should have been nominated for Oscar in stead of Leonardo DiCarprio. Laura Linney is perfect as supportive and understanding wife Clara McMillen Mac to Kinsey earning a welldeserved Oscar Supporting nomination and good enough to win but for a particularly strong field this year in this category. Peter Sarsgaard who was nothing short of brilliant as Chuck Lane in Shattered Glass shines again as Clyde Martin protg research assistant and onetime lover to Kinsey and Mrs. Kinsey!. Oliver Platt and Tim Curry as supporter and opponent respectively in the academic circle add further dimensions and depth to the Kinsey story. The rest of the cast is equally excellent. And then there is the brief but unforgettable appearance of Lynn Redgrave.While the movie is serious and intellectually challenging it's not without its light moments such as Mac's revenge I coined. Perfectly honest and without even contemplating potential adverse emotional impacts Kinsey tells Mac all about his homosexual awakening with Martin. But when Martin wants to go back to some straight sex and in the name of the research suggests to sleep with Mac she jovially responses I think I might like that right in the presence of Kinsey!I like the way the movie ends in a spiritually intimate moment of the Kinseys in the natural beauty of the red wood forest. After a brief pensive deeply touching moment Dr. Kensey's spirit soars again when Mac asks What's the hurry?. There's work to be done he replies starting in brisk strides.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie masks the truths and horrors about this man's activities. I did a fair bit of research on this so called scientist and learn some of the REAL details. I was bitterly disappointed that the the movie portrayed him to be some kind of sexual hero when in truth he was nothing more than a pervert who used his pseudo scientific work to justify his own behavior. First of all it was directed by a gay activist who I'm sure was bent on showing how society has hidden behind moral values to isolate and demonize homosexual behavior. Although this is true using this man's work to shed new light and understanding on the gay community is sort of like dressing a wolf in sheep's clothing. Here's some facts I have uncoveredKinsey relied on consultants  in the form of pedophiles  to gather added information on the sexual responses of children. One of these men was a notorious childmolester named Rex King who was responsible for the rape of over eighthundred children. This predator related to Kinsey numerous stories about his child rape in graphic detail information that Kinsey considered to be merely scientific research. Kinsey's perversion started early. He became a scoutmaster at the age of seventeen and in 1921 in a letter he wrote to a fellow YMCA counselor boasted of a nature library that he possessed. This collection comprised nudist magazines that contained pictures and drawings of nude men and boys and Kinsey would show them to his young male charges in his tent  alone  late at night. As a professor at the University of Indiana he took long camping trips with young male students. During these excursions Kinsey would parade around nude in front of the young men bath with them and according to the wife of one of the students take advantage of them during group masturbation sessions. Kinsey maintained a collection of gorgeous homosexual male photographs and forced members of his staff to engage in various forms of sexual activity ostensibly for the purposes of breaking down moral barriers against such behavior.Kinsey conducted research that supposedly demonstrated that young boys  as young as two months of age  could experience multiple orgasms. He claimed that the maximum number observed in a twentyfour hour period was 26 climaxes . . . in a thirteenyearold and a fouryearold. It took forty years for anyone to wonder how data is collected on the sexual responses of children as young as five. You don't have to wonder for long however. Dr. Judith Reisman who has been a longtime Kinsey critic received the answer from an actual member of the Kinsey team. This accessory named Paul Gebhard stated that Kinsey's men used manual and oral techniques to produce the desired effect. There are numerous other facts and the more you uncover the more you realize this man was nothing more than a demon. I strongly urge you do NOT watch this movie which supports a group of people interested in nothing more than decriminalizing child molestation.I'm sadly disappointed Steven Speilsburb would have ANYTHING to do with this movie.Joe".

That is what I thought when I first discovered this 'gem' of a film. I picked it up to enjoy with my wife and strangely I found myself enjoying it more than her.Without giving too much away or more than already has by others this is a twisted story where we as viewers have the opportunity to see the plot unfold from both of our main characters. Audrey Tautou takes a devilishly good turn from her innocent character in Amelie to play an artist who falls in love  or so we think. As we watch her whirlwind romance with a married man hit their ups and downs like any normal relationship we get comfortable and stable with the film  then suddenly it changes. We rewind backwards and are shown the story through the eyes of her 'boyfriend'. Our image of this film enhances as we are handed the unexpected.This was a beautiful film. From not only the cinematography but also the characters and the story. This was a rarity. It is not often that you find a film of this caliber in today's modern cinema. Normally films have a very structured story with its theme defined early within the film. Not this masterpiece. If you assume that you know this film prior to finishing it then you will be the laughing stock of the town. I have seen several films in my lifetime and I can honestly say that I never saw this story unfolding. I was one of those that expected the beginning to be the entire story  boy was I surprised.Tautou carries this film on her bare shoulders. She gives a stunning performance as a woman with a heart full of love for a man that she encounters. Her turn from Amelie proves that she is a very versatile actor.She emotionally pulls you from your seat and glues you to the screen. Add to this the sheer brilliance of the story with all of its twists and turns and powerful cast that only accentuates Tautou's absurdity only helps propel this story from average to amazing.This is one of those films that I can watch time and time again without it loosing its appeal. I would suggest it for anyone that has ever had a secret admirer. For anyone that has obsessed over anyone from afar this is the film for you.

This is one of those mixed genre movies that actually works! Audrey Tautou is so charming and capable as an actress that she makes you root for her even when you know she's playing someone completely crazy. She's already the biggest most successful actress here in France and she's going to get even bigger. She's got what it takes to play different characters and she shows that in this movie.The director brilliantly pieces together the two halves of this movie and by the end it is believable. We almost wanted to watch it again so we can catch the tricks but we didn't have time.Anyway this is a great French treat and for those of you who liked Tautou in Amelie and A Very Long Engagement you're going to like her in this one too.".

An apparent tragic love story is being told from one of the partners angle in the first half of the movie  just to be retold from the other partner perspective in the second part.

I don't want to give too much away but I need to say that the film shows the story from two points of view hers Audrey's and his Samuel Le Bihan who is inspired and harrowing as the object of the obsession. The script is so spectacularly brilliant and ingeniouslyplotted that this film joins 'l'Appartement' and 'Tell No One' as one of the bestcrafted thriller scripts of the last twenty years in any country. It was written by the director Laetitia Colombani aged 312 the same as Audrey Tautou and Caroline Thivel. They should have had a Cesar for it. The direction is wonderful paced to perfection inspired chilling indeed terrifying. What a triumph. And anyone who believed Audrey Tautou could not surpass herself was wrong.".

It's alright...not fantastic or even fantastique but in short I feel worth viewing overall.Okay....so fellow viewers are we alone now?Or aren't we? This film plays with the audience setting out a tantalizing trap with not only the adorable Audrey as bait but a saturation of color as well. Audrey as the ironically diabolical Angelique portrays a successful art student much to my pleasure the art this film proffers as hers does come across as interesting. That's a small success in itself. I wonder if it was just the art department or if they hired an artist to come up with the few items we see.Along those lines I loved the scene wherein she defaces the nude portrait. Actually someone else on this list wrote that the model posing for that was nude but as I saw the film he clearly had shorts on. I found myself briefly wondering if for the sake of the allAmerican fear of male nudity an alternate shot was inserted for stateside DVD's. We've the right to bear arms but not to bare penises?Anyways the scene is meant to underscore the absolute devotion Angelique has for Loic she only has eyes for him. Regrettably we learn those eyes are turned completely inward. If language is a virus from outerspace then love as represented here is a mental disease from the galaxy as well. The film is strictly split in two Venus going first and then Mars following its floral path.I've recently read Ian McEwan's Atonement and that like He Loves Me He Loves Me Not was another piece of fiction that hinged a great deal upon its construction. In reflecting back upon both the construction is what I consider most... the main female character in both ends up being to a degree untrustworthy and well unlikeable. Instead of her personality perspicuity or perfume that lingers it is the sense of manipulation involved. In this film both the manipulation by the sweet stalker on the target of her love...and the manipulation of the director on us the somewhat unwitting audience.It is interesting to me that so many people complained about The Swimming Pool and none here gripe about A la folie... To me the former is a far better film and its ambiguities give the film more resonance. Oh well vive le difference...As always with foreign films I worry that living in the subtitles I may miss some witty dialog. More so with this film...still the translation did include some pointed phrases and echoes. Yet I cannot even find a literal translation of the French title... it cannot be as tidy as the English titling.Oh okay here it is httpwww.splicedonline.com03featureslcolombani.htmlInteresting it actually comes from the same ritual but I think the English is even more succinct for this film.Even before the title the film rating mentioned something about obsessive behavior. It sorta cracked me up I'd never seen that before. I actually thought it was a joke included by the filmmakers but mpaa.org shows it as part of the official warning. Too bad in real life the people we meet do not come with such guidance tattooed on their foreheads.I see some reviews refer to this as a horror film I think it is much more in the suspense category although that isn't quite right as the film is built upon a dream then takes an abrupt uturn into a nightmare. The scariest thing about A la Folie...Pas du Tout is that the director was only 26 and able to craft something so glossy. With IMDb showing nothing in her current queue I hope she has not frightened off all of the producers.610".

I found myself briefly wondering if for the sake of the allAmerican fear of male nudity an alternate shot was inserted for stateside DVD's. We've the right to bear arms but not to bare penises?Anyways the scene is meant to underscore the absolute devotion Angelique has for Loic she only has eyes for him. Regrettably we learn those eyes are turned completely inward. If language is a virus from outerspace then love as represented here is a mental disease from the galaxy as well. The film is strictly split in two Venus going first and then Mars following its floral path.I've recently read Ian McEwan's Atonement and that like He Loves Me He Loves Me Not was another piece of fiction that hinged a great deal upon its construction. In reflecting back upon both the construction is what I consider most... the main female character in both ends up being to a degree untrustworthy and well unlikeable. Instead of her personality perspicuity or perfume that lingers it is the sense of manipulation involved. In this film both the manipulation by the sweet stalker on the target of her love...and the manipulation of the director on us the somewhat unwitting audience.It is interesting to me that so many people complained about The Swimming Pool and none here gripe about A la folie... To me the former is a far better film and its ambiguities give the film more resonance. Oh well vive le difference...As always with foreign films I worry that living in the subtitles I may miss some witty dialog. More so with this film...still the translation did include some pointed phrases and echoes. Yet I cannot even find a literal translation of the French title... it cannot be as tidy as the English titling.Oh okay here it is httpwww.splicedonline.com03featureslcolombani.htmlInteresting it actually comes from the same ritual but I think the English is even more succinct for this film.Even before the title the film rating mentioned something about obsessive behavior. It sorta cracked me up I'd never seen that before. I actually thought it was a joke included by the filmmakers but mpaa.org shows it as part of the official warning. Too bad in real life the people we meet do not come with such guidance tattooed on their foreheads.I see some reviews refer to this as a horror film I think it is much more in the suspense category although that isn't quite right as the film is built upon a dream then takes an abrupt uturn into a nightmare. The scariest thing about A la Folie...Pas du Tout is that the director was only 26 and able to craft something so glossy. With IMDb showing nothing in her current queue I hope she has not frightened off all of the producers.610";

	schema:reviewBody "Wise career move for Audrey Tautou after the excruciatingly cute Amelie. Newcomer Laetitia Colombani's debut He Loves Me He Loves Me Not appears to go out of its way to take Tautou's tendency for bugcuteness to say nothing of her elfin hyperactivity to the max rubbing our face in it. If you thought she seemed a little demented in Amelie as I did then this movie justifies your suspicions. It's clear that Tautou is determined not to be the 4' 11version of Audrey Hepburn going instead for the fierce sharpclawed furrylittlebeast appeal of Genevieve Bujold.Tautou plays an art student  a young adorable romantic who does the very French thing of falling in love with an older man a handsome cardiologist played well by Samuel Le Bihan. Tautou puttputts around town on her moped loitering at flowershops mooning over the man of her dreams and slowly losing her job at a caf because of it. The fact that she's housesitting for a welltodo couple whose house is across the street from Le Bihan's makes it all seem deliciously easy. Slight snag though he's married and the wife is pregnant. But we're assured the separation is coming soon and a romantic trip to Florence is already in the works.Director Colombani is in too much of a hurry during these first 45 minutes. Events cascade at a breakneck speed and before you know it our heroine has gone off the deep end after things haven't gone her way she literally runs starkraving mad around a local park trashes her paintings makes a mess of the place she's temporarily living in turns on the stovegas in preparation for a dirtnap. One is ready to assume that the movie has either lost its moorings or is simply inept but then the entire thing suddenly rewinds back to the beginning for the cardiologist's perspective of the events. And what a different perspective it is! We've been had. The movie slows down during the second half adding decorative details nuances in character a series of redherrings important sidestories and above all a great performance from Le Bihan as a man whose world is falling apart. It becomes clear why Colombani felt that she had to hurry things along early in the film but I think she went a bit overboard. The narrative surprises in the second half would have been enriched by a more careful delineation of plot and character in the first half. We're not convinced by Tautou's side of the story with the result that Le Bihan's half becomes a bit diagrammatic despite its better execution. I'm afraid the best that Colombani can come up with is HOW will Le Bihan catch on to things? And I'm sorrier to say that he arrives to his conclusion via that hoary cinematic standby the flashbacks of previous scenes while lying in bed mulling things over.I'm usually complaining about movies being too long but He Loves Me He Loves Me Not should have been 1520 minutes longer with most of those minutes focusing on Tautou's narrative. Besides I wouldn't have minded spending more time with the exquisite cinematography on display. The flowershop sequence is a visual wonder. It was also nice to see a filmmaker use and stubbornly maintain a consistent visual motif e.g. roses. Perhaps directors these days are too afraid to be called pretentious if they make use of symbols or perhaps they're simply too lazy to bother figuring the Ritalin addicts will be too distracted to notice. In any event it was nice to see it here.Not bad at all good for a rental. 4 stars out of 10.".

She brags that he will leave his wife and they will go on a vacation together. Yet it never happens.  He seems to everybody else to be a real heel then...everything is reversed.  The whole second half of the picture shows things from his viewpoint.  This is no love affair at all. This women is a psycho stalking this man and his wife and nearly destroying their lives.     This is a entertaining puzzler one that hasn't been done in a long time.  The first half is a bit awkward as it becomes obvious that things aren't quite right.  Yet things really start to click in the second half. It's fun seeing it all come together.  Everything that didn't make sense at the start soon becomes much clearer.  This is a very detailed oriented film that examines and emphasis the little things.  This will be most enjoyable to those who like to break things down and then piece it all together.  On the whole it stays believable and has a good flowing logic.     Best of all it doesn't use all the accepted traits of a typical thriller.  There is no calculated scares tension or violence.  The lighting is bright and colorful and the pacing breezy.  It's almost like an actual love story  which is what gives it some insight.  It shows how fragile the beauty and innocence of love is and how easily it can turn dark and ugly.  It also shows how the simplest and nicest of gestures can  easily spin out of control if done with the wrong person.       Tautou is terrific in the title role.  She looks and acts like no psycho you have seen before which is what actually makes her one of the most memorable and scariest.  She has a very child like face that holds a lot of excitement and innocence.  It compliments the character that seems very entrenched in a child like world of love and romance.  Having her revert to such ugly behavior makes it even more jolting.   This also makes it more realistic since true life sociopaths and psychos can be very hard to detect at the outset.     This would have made a perfect satire since we as a culture seem very obsessed with love and relationships.  Having her verified as a nut case seems to kill this.  Yet it is still worthwhile and yes even funny.  It is also educational as it seems to actually pinpoint the characters affliction. It is called erotomania.  Overall it is well executed and gives the old stalker theme a fresh coat of paint.  Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not had been sitting in my Netflix Queue for some time. I hadn't heard much about it but my love for Audrey Tautou made me curious to see it. I kept putting it off though something about the cover and the tag line Is she crazy in love or just crazy? made it seem kind of like a cutsie romantic comedy that wasn't going to interest me. However my sister who had been putting off seeing it for the same reason finally watched it and told me how great it was. I must thank her because if not for her I might have taken an even longer time to watch this wonderful film.The film is far from a silly romantic comedy in any way it falls closer to a thriller than anything else and at some points in the film it even gets rather disturbing. That being said the tag line that I mentioned before should not be taken as a light hearted jest the tag line should be taken rather seriously because the sanity of the Angelique Audrey Tautou is in question for quite a bit of the film.Audrey Tautou plays Angelique marvelously as is expected since she has yet to disappoint me in any film I have seen her in it doesn't hurt that she is pretty damn cute as well. However in this film that cute and innocent looking exterior may be hiding something much more sinister and disturbing. Audrey Tautou does a good job of making us wonder if Anglique is really all there for most of the movie. Sometimes she seems to be on the verge of a breakdown and sometimes she lets her anger do some dastardly things.The whole movie is put together in a way that the audience really doesn't know what to expect from Angelique. At first she seems like a sweet and innocent girl that wouldn't hurt a fly. However when Loic the married man that she is dating begins to leads her on and breaks promises she begins to lose it. Has Loic led her down this path of self destruction or is there something even more troubling going on for Angelique? One of the best parts of the film is that the audience gets to see the relationship between Loic and Angelique from both sides of the relationship. Only after the audience has seen both sides can they really see how this relationship came into existence and how Angelique's problems began to manifest themselves. I definitely loved this film it was a well written and well acted thriller that kept me on my toes quite a bit. I highly recommend this to anyone especially if you are a fan of Audrey Tautou.".

And then comes the twist which might be the greatest I've ever seen. It sets us back at the beginning of the story and shows it from the Le Bihan's point of view completely changing everything. Tautou goes from being an adorable naive victim to a creepy psychopath absolutely out of her mind. Bihan goes from being an adulterous prick to a painfully sympathetic victim. It's got to be the most phenomenal unpredictable twist I've ever seen.

It was made right after 'Amelie' and it looks like 'Amelie' especially in the opening scenes on the beautiful and colorful streets of Bordeaux that prepare a viewer for the light romantic story. Young and pretty Art student Angelique Audrey Tautou seems to have found her fabulous destiny and the love of her life in Laic a cardiologist Samuel Le Bihan who seems to be as much in love with her as she is with him. But is he? And what about his wife who is pregnant with their first child? Step by step the film takes an interesting turn and becomes a story rather dark and disturbing told from different perspectives Rashomon  style. What started as a light and sweet romantic comedy very successfully turned into a well made thriller. The way the young writerdirector presented and contrasted two points of view at the same events is remarkable. We all know from Geometry classes that parallel lines never cross at least in Euclid's Geometry they don't but sometimes when you look at the lines in space from certain POV it looks like they cross  I kept thinking about it while watching He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not which I highly recommend. Audrey Tautou was wonderful  without giving too much out I just say that she played a character that I found deeper darker and more interesting than Amelie the dark side of Amelie.".

But when a movie purports to be reflecting real life albeit that of someone mentally sick then I expect THAT movie to be realistic. The doctor did too many things in the movie that a rational person wouldn't have done in my opinion.

Instead he kept taking things into his own hands just drifting along until the movie was over. So I was pretty much bored except when I could watch Audrey's beautiful face.

This is the story of Angelique Audrey Tautou of Amelie who is desperately in love with Loic Samuel Le Bihan. Loic is married and refuses to leave his pregnant wife for Angelique.The story is told first from Angelique's point of view and shows the pain she suffers and the attempts she makes to win her love. Then we see things from Loic's point of view which is astonishing. This is a fascinating example of storytelling. The plot has a very interesting and unexpected twist. I hesitate to go into much detail about the plot for fear of spoiling the surprise but I will say this story stands distinctly apart from the drab predictable plots and neat endings that we are so used to in American movies. Audrey Tautou is wonderful. She has such an expressive way about her. My prediction is that her popularity in film will only continue to grow.My chief complaint in regards to this film is that apart from the way the story is presented it lacks originality. However the execution of the story is often 80 of it's value so I find this to be a fairly minor complaint. I was also a little disappointed with the ending. It seemed a trifle contrived. Overall I don't hesitate to highly recommend this film but watch it from the beginning don't tune in on cable halfway through the flick. As I said without the plot twist the story lacks originality.

Daniel Radcliffe plays a very subdued character far removed from HARRY POTTER and shows that he has the talent to continue in the business as an adult. The other 3 boys are good finds and I am sure we will see more of them in the future. While there is only a small cast each one has a strong role and Mr  Mrs McAnsh are truly memorable.

	schema:reviewBody "The buzz for December Boys surely points to how Daniel Radcliffe will fare sans cloak glasses and lightning bolt scar on his forehead to star in a movie that's totally out of the Harry Potter franchise. Gone are the fantastical elements and scores of ready adoring fans and in comes a serious dramatic piece about the coming of age growing up and raging hormones. Wait Harry Potter is about that too doesn't it although it stretches over 7 movies? But Radcliffe comes through unscathed and it's not before long that you'd forget that here's Harry Potter. While possibly the biggest recognizable name on the cast list it wasn't a walkover performance as everyone else had raised their act and not allow a young starlet usurp the strength of the movie. Based on a novel by Michael Noonan December Boys tells the story of 4 orphans all being born in the month of December who were sent packing to a seaside village for a vacation by virtue that it's a reward sent to the orphanage and what better lazier? way to select the lucky few than the ones celebrating their birthdays the same month.So we have Maps Radcliffe Misty Lee Cormie Sparks Christian Byers and Spit James Fraser sent on a journey that will test their close friendship and as usual each will come face to face with their individual challenge that will forever change their lives. Gee I sound like a generic trailer but trust me although the premise might sound clich December Boys hinges very heavily on the delivery of the child actors for its success. While the spotlight might be on Radcliffe and Cormie Byers and Fraser each have their own charm but are restrained by the frequency of their characters' onscreen appearance. The landscape of Kangaroo Island adds vast scale to this relatively small movie opening our eyes to natural geographical wonders becoming a character in itself with its inhabitants mere players on its grounds.While it's not Stand By Me there's the usual basis that lurks around begging for comparisons. And worse the story here allows for each of them to try and go one leg up on the other as they learn that one of the purposes they are there at the village was to allow for one of them to be selected for adoption. Hence the competition amongst the boys as they vie for attention putting on their best behaviour most contrary to what their actual characters are like. Each child however have an episode directed around him to similarly allow the audience to pick their preferred sub plots involving a giant fish a misunderstood motorcycle stuntman dealing with mortality issues when their surrogate guardian has to battle disease and of course saving the best for last and for Radcliffe first love in the form of a young lolita Lucy Teresa Palmer.Soon their hot blooded young boy antics and rebellious streaks give way to a tone of seriousness and there's where the movie adds its poignant gravitas. December Boys might not seem much from the get go but with each passing minute it adds layers upon layers to build its repertoire and stand up against the scrutiny of mediocrity. By the time the final scene rolls by even though it doesn't show much and does so mostly through narration I thought the ending was perfect with a tinge of regret happiness sorrow and a show of solidarity all rolled into one.".

Each child however have an episode directed around him to similarly allow the audience to pick their preferred sub plots involving a giant fish a misunderstood motorcycle stuntman dealing with mortality issues when their surrogate guardian has to battle disease and of course saving the best for last and for Radcliffe first love in the form of a young lolita Lucy Teresa Palmer.Soon their hot blooded young boy antics and rebellious streaks give way to a tone of seriousness and there's where the movie adds its poignant gravitas. December Boys might not seem much from the get go but with each passing minute it adds layers upon layers to build its repertoire and stand up against the scrutiny of mediocrity. By the time the final scene rolls by even though it doesn't show much and does so mostly through narration I thought the ending was perfect with a tinge of regret happiness sorrow and a show of solidarity all rolled into one.";

	schema:reviewBody "I believe many of the movie critics out there have been far too harsh in dismissing this film. I found it rather refreshing from the overhyped over sensationalized and big budget disappointments in the past few years. Many of the indielow budget films are far better than what is making the big dollars and getting the heavy promotion these days.December Boys is not a great film but it certainly is good and I found it very enjoyable. I laughed I cried...and Mr Radcliffe is definitely on his way to a long and successful career. He isn't the leading character although he is definitely the headlining star that without him this film probably would never have seen the light of day outside Australia. I thought his performance was wonderful. He may not have much dialog but the sensitivity of his character comes across beautifully. I believe Mr. Radcliffe is underrated as an actor one desperately trying not to be typecast and stereotyped a the boy wizard. If the media would stop reminding us that he's Harry Potter and let him be the untapped talent that he obviously is.... Give audiences credit that we can separate an actor from the role he plays. Frankly not all of us are Potter fans and I don't see HP as this great literary work. It's an okay story that has benefited from brilliant marketing. However I'm grateful because HP gave us a troupe of new and very talented young actors...and showcased just how many brilliant actors come from the UK.Given many of the horrific child stars and forgettable cookie cutter actors out there in equally forgettable films  here is a young man that shows promise in the years to come. Give him a chance. He is obviously trying very hard to be more than what he's been painted since he was 10. Maps isn't a huge stretch but a stepping stone from Potter. You can see where Radcliffe was in terms of acting ability right after Potter 4. He is easing his way delicately from his alter ego. Then he demolished his Mickey Mouse Club image with Equus. It's a shame that wasn't made into a film. He was truly brilliant as Alan Strang.Granted this film like others with Alist stars mind you has its trouble spots but it still doesn't detract that it was beautifully shot and some of the acting was impeccable. Radcliffe has notably excelled further since this film was made over two years ago. Equus showcased that he isn't a one trick pony and that we really do have someone worth looking forward to as a brilliant actor in the future.This film isn't perfect but I just saw two other films this week that had huge plot holes and continuity errors etc soso acting performances with clichd plots and so forth but still garnered high praise. Maybe its the high profile stars or those producingpromoting these films. I just don't understand critics sometimes. I don't think anyone expected Oscarcaliber from this film or Radcliffe but at the same time it is a helluva lot better than other films released this year. To be honest I would have been disappointed in Radcliffe if he chose some dopey tween flick that seems to be the calling card of American young stars. Herbie Fully Loaded and High School Musical are such great films after all. Radcliffe could cash in on his current fame like the others and make trash and be the poster boy of the tabloids but he doesn't. That should count for something. I'd rather read more about him than the likes of Lindsay Paris and Britney any day of the week. .I have seen complete garbage nominated for Oscars in the past and lately I don't put too much stock into many movie critics that give A ratings to films that I cannot believe someone paid money to even make let alone ones that I would waste my money on.There's nothing wrong with a film that has a simple story line....a feel good movie thats enjoyable to watch. It doesn't have to have grotesque violence language and explicit sex scenes. Probably one reason I love old Hollywood and independent films. Generally I find these films wonderful and many great ones and ones that are worth the ticket price and buying the DVD. I can't say that about most of the films that are released every year nowadays.It just seems this poor guy Radcliffe can't win for losing. If he released a candyteenybopper flick he would have been crucified...he really takes a risk and goes for it with Equus and people freaked out that he wasn't a good role model for the Potter fans....oh what a travesty! Yet he was a splash on the London stage and has obviously grown as an actor since this movie was made. Give the guy a break.....I think he will only get better and better with time. I know this was long winded but I really champion this young actor. Not all Radcliffe fans are squealing 10 year olds.The only thing I found worth to criticise in December Boys was the unclear time period and the time span in the aging of the characters at the end. Hardy unfortunately used music from different periods. The film looks to be set in the 60's but some of the music tells otherwise. And obviously the 'present day' older boys are too old in my opinion by a couple decades.Some say it was too sugar coated etc...but there were many films in the golden age of Hollywood which I loved that would now be considered too chaste too sweet unrealistic...the list goes on and on. I would still take those movies and this one any day of the week over 95 of the garbage that is released today.Forget the critics....go see December Boys.".

	schema:reviewBody "December Boys is an overly sentimental and clich ridden tale but it has a special something that makes it work. That something is the engaging performances of the two major boys  Daniel Radcliffe and Lee Cormie.The action takes place during a Christmas holiday of the late 60's or early 70's in Australia. The December boys are four boys from an outback orphanage whose birthdays fall in December. They are given a treat of a vacation at the shore provided by an older couple.The four are three preadolescents  Sparks Spit and Misty Cormie  and one older boy who acts as the big brother of the younger three. He is Maps played by Radcliffe. The story is told by Misty as an adult and contains many probably misremembered events of that eventful vacation.The boys are hosted by an older couple with the man being played by Jack Thompson as Bandy. This is a barebones part and Thompson's considerable talents are wasted. Bandy's wife is ill with cancer and there are some interesting scenes of interactions with the boys but the couple plays a very small role in the whole thing.The vacation cabin is in a small cove accompanied by several others and the inhabitants of these neighboring cabins provide a number of interesting characters. The most interesting to the boys is a young childless couple. They are seen as potential parents by the boys and the three younger ones compete in a battle for their attention  led by Misty.Maps is far more interested in a local teenage girl with whom he develops an intimate relationship. Because Radcliffe became famous as Harry Potter Russell Edwards of Variety sarcastically states Destined to be forever known as Harry Potter Gets Laid but I saw much more in Radcliffe's portrayal of a teenager's first love. His performance is richly affecting.December Boys is an entertaining combination of the vacation adventures and fantasies of four boys coupled with that longing purity of first love. It's not a great movie but it gives the viewer a good feeling and gives this viewer some memories and emotions of times long passed.".

Their hosts were stalwarts of the church and lived in a small cove with 3 other families right on the sea. The youngest Misty overhears the young couple discussing adopting one of the boys and from there on in it is a competition to win the affection of the couple. Sounds good  throw in a beautiful location South Australia and an adolescent love interest and it all should have added up to more than it did.There were to me many shortfalls. The adult characters were incomplete unrounded almost cardboard cut out with the exception of Skipper the female church stalwart who is the kids' host. The soundtrack other than the 60s pop music was risible  sweet and sickly and wholly inappropriate  result being it was too intrusive and mawkish. Mix the sweet and sickly soundtrack with long shots of the stunning scenery and even that became dull and boring. The plot clunked along from one scene to the other badly edited and without any smoothness or apparent connection. Decisions were made in isolation with little development. It all came across as unreal and unbelievable. And as for the apparitions and the last scene involving the boys as adults was laugh out loud absurd  half the audience certainly thought so when I saw it  howls of sniggering and laughter.Shame really  as I said wanted to enjoy it for a number of reasons  its Australian its a good a story I wanted Daniel Radcliffe to set himself up post Harry Potter and he actually didn't do a bad job  the most convincing scene in the film involved adolescent embarrassment between him and Teresa Palmer etc.. But no matter what I have to be truthful and place this film alongside 'Inside Paris' as the worst films of the year.".

The only thing I didn't like was the scene in the end with virgin Mariathe holy mother whoever it was underwater... but the rest is just amazing emotional and tragical and in the same place fantastic and beautiful! When I saw the sceneries I was so amazed and wanted to get back to Kangaroo Island. It is really funny if you've once got a personal relationship to that island because there are only about 30004000 people living there and I've been to the biggest party The Sheep Shearers Ball and got to know a few locals and lived with locals. Nice people beautiful Island... Go There!".

	schema:reviewBody "December Boys marks star Daniel Radcliffe's first lead foray outside the world of Hogwarts and the magic is conspicuously lost. Not that Rod Hardy's wellmeaning drama is terribly bad but it's listless and overly sentimental that ultimately it's a forgettable experience.Set in 1930s Australia Radcliffe plays the role of Maps an orphan boy raised in a Catholic orphanage. Together with three other orphans born in December hence their eponymous moniker they were sent on a holiday at a beach for Christmas where a newlywed couple plans to adopt one of them.While the film's location and cinematography are breathtaking there's not much else. Marc Rosenberg's script adapted from Michael Noonan's novel can't achieve enough momentum to keep it out of a monotonous setup. The characters are such bland figures lacking any sense of depth which unfortunately fails to give Radcliffe a role that's more challenging than being eh an orphan.In the end there's not much to make for the overtly familiar convention. Save for the visuals there's nothing here that you haven't already seen in other comingofage films which might have been done better.".

However despite the inclusion of several costars the writing focuses more on the boys who are superbly convincing. The cinematography is beautiful throughout with delightful scenic shots and close ups that capture the wonder of childhood.I assumed the film was based in the 60's but there is no given time line and the chosen score is too post modern and does nothing to encapsulate that era.

You could not ask more of children this age. Daniel Radcliffe also shone in this role and I am always delighted to see his movies he is truly an inspiration for people who want to do good in this world. The scenery is gorgeous. A rocky cove in a corner of Australia away from civilisation with powerlines turned on by generators and sanddunes and old cars to play on. Simply put the simple things in life we now take for granted and shun because we have our iPads and computers cars and video games. We have forgotten the feeling of brotherhood of looking out for each other of enjoying the simple things in life of fighting but reconciling in the end of the merit of good deeds that even when they are hard to make come back to you in a good way.There is not one criticism I would make of this film. It is a film about growing up and making hard choices about loneliness and a sense of belonging about friendship brotherhood first love and lost family parenting good life skills. Anything you want this movie offers.Do not believe a word the critics say. I haven't and I was absolutely delighted by this movie. If you have a heart and are a human being you will too. And after you have wept in tears of joy about the beautiful melancholy and serene sense of purpose this movie guides you to you will then recommend it to your friends and the words of love and life will spread.100 out of 10!".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of this film is very touching focusing on four young Australian orphans the film portrays the end of childhood and the beginning of adolescence. The four boys are united by an immortal friendship strengthened by constant union. Having no family they became family to one another. The eldest in fact no longer has any hope of knowing what it is to have a mother and father. They're sent by the orphanage to a small seashore village as a birthday present but on this trip their bonds of friendship and brotherhood will be tested when they suspect that a couple of local residents may be thinking of adopting one of them. It's also a moment of discovery of sexuality. The four are already curious about women but only one really is old enough to do their sexual initiation.The cast revolves around four young actors being the oldest and most famous of them Daniel Radcliffe the eternal Harry Potter. Lee Cormie Christian Byers and James Fraser three actors unknown to me so far complete the quartet. I think they were all excellent in their respective roles being the youngest of all to assume the role of narrating the story in hindsight. Each one will overcome their personal challenges and will mature with it which makes the film gradually more serious mature and emotive. At the end the most emotional scene shows us how that friendship has surpassed the test of time. A word of praise for the choice of filming locations with beautiful maritime landscapes and enchanting beaches.I think most people who see this movie do it because of Daniel Radcliffe but after watching it I think it has a lot more to offer. The whole cast was very good the place is beautiful but above all the story told is very touching.".

	schema:reviewBody "A touching account of the stresses and joys a group orphaned children under reasonably good care at an orphanage based in Australia. A group of four named December Boys DB primarily because they're all identified as such on their birthday month are the first selected to be treated to a onceina lifetime opportunity for a Christmas holiday by the sea. The movie takes us across the length of quite an amazing Australian countryside. From the get go the DB are like brothers in every sense. For Radcliffe this film overlaps a bit with the Harry Potter movie series. Here he is the eldest of the DB group and the big brother of the group enjoying the experience but less mesmerized by everything than the younger boys in the group. The youngest of the group Misty is very much reminiscent of Radcliffe in HP Sorcerer's Stone in terms of his look of wonder and amazement at everything he sees. It's the older and wiser Misty who narrates the story. He's the first to be bitten by the temptation of the little community by the sea. No Spoilers.A very heavy element of Catholicism is present throughout the film  the orphanage is run by religious sisters a priest chaperones the DBs on holiday the family sponsoring their seaside holiday is extremely religious and Misty has a unique understanding of the Virgin Mary and of women in general. No spoilers however you should be ready for the religious element coupled with the boyish considerations of good and bad. The boys are entertained by almost anything and the members of the little seaside community each have their encountersshenanigans with the DBs but midway in the film Misty turns on the group in a desperate effort to secure his adoption by the family sponsoring their holiday. No spoilers. Radcliffe Map in the film is struggling with the fact that he's nearly old enough to be let out of the orphanage for the majority of the film he tries to play the subdued teenager who isn't easily moved or eager to be adopted but other factors come into play for him. No spoilers.There's a funny confessional scene you'll have to see for yourself but the most moving aspect of the film is that faith and brotherhood thrive even in the desolate little neighborhood. While nobody in the town is well off by any means the message to do unto others... and to help lift each other up is present among the adults throughout not only though their words of prayer but through their quiet actions.The story is very touching and relatable. A lovely film you should watch for yourself.".

No Spoilers.A very heavy element of Catholicism is present throughout the film  the orphanage is run by religious sisters a priest chaperones the DBs on holiday the family sponsoring their seaside holiday is extremely religious and Misty has a unique understanding of the Virgin Mary and of women in general. No spoilers however you should be ready for the religious element coupled with the boyish considerations of good and bad. The boys are entertained by almost anything and the members of the little seaside community each have their encountersshenanigans with the DBs but midway in the film Misty turns on the group in a desperate effort to secure his adoption by the family sponsoring their holiday. No spoilers. Radcliffe Map in the film is struggling with the fact that he's nearly old enough to be let out of the orphanage for the majority of the film he tries to play the subdued teenager who isn't easily moved or eager to be adopted but other factors come into play for him. No spoilers.There's a funny confessional scene you'll have to see for yourself but the most moving aspect of the film is that faith and brotherhood thrive even in the desolate little neighborhood. While nobody in the town is well off by any means the message to do unto others... and to help lift each other up is present among the adults throughout not only though their words of prayer but through their quiet actions.The story is very touching and relatable. A lovely film you should watch for yourself.";

	schema:reviewBody "I was interested in December Boys 2007 for two reasons I like nonraunchy comingofage flicks and the fact that it takes place on the Southern coast of Australia actually it was shot on Kangaroo Island part of South Australia. As for Daniel Radcliffe the star of the popular Harry Potter films I've never seen him in a movie before and have no interest in him or Potter.The story revolves around four boys from an Outback Catholic orphanage who get to celebrate their December birthdays by taking a Christmas holiday on the coast. They discover that a young childless couple are interested in adopting one of them which creates a bit of rivalry although the oldest one Radcliffe could care less and spends his time learning about girls and romance. Their time at the coast becomes a cornerstone experience as they ultimately discover what family means.Unless you're Australian I encourage you to utilize the English subtitles to understand the nighunintelligible Australian dialect. Otherwise you'll only comprehend about half the dialogue and the story will be lost to you. No kidding.After seeing the film a few times I only remember two of the boys Maps and Misty. The others might as well have been phantoms. The plot is interesting but the story asplayedout is not very compelling although the epilogue is slightly moving. The film tries too hard to be magical. Scenes come and go with largely illdefined characters and little dialogue or explanation. This is definitely a picture where you'll have to read in between the lines to appreciate which might make it good for repeatviewings.On the positive side the Kangaroo Island locations are fabulous especially the high shots of Remarkable Rocks in Flinders Chase National Park.The picture really comes alive when Teresa Palmer is on screen she plays femme fatale Lucy. The movie poster or DVD cover is deceiving in that Teresa looks to be about 1213 yearsold. Actually she was 20 during filming and plays an about16 girl with curvy legs from here to New York. Lucy's scenes with Maps are the highlight of the picture and not at all awkward as another reviewer contended. Lucy is aware of her tantalizing feminine powers and skillfully utilizes them to bewitch Maps with her spell.Other highlights include a secret cave high up on the rocks a wild black horse who seems to fish an Evel Knievaltype character who may not be as Fearless as he lets on a colossal fish named Henry and the cantankerous old man fascinated by it.The DVD feature about 10minutes of deleted scenes that should have never been deleted. Make sure you catch 'em as they help explain the story better.In the book the story was set in the 30s but the filmmakers decided to switch it to the late 60s. Some people found this confusing but I didn't. Others complained that the childrenasadults at the end were too old considering they were kids in the late 60s but the epilogue obviously takes place in the near future like the 2010s or 2020s which would put them in their 50s or 60s.BOTTOM LINE Although the story is merely okay as far as captivating and moving cinema goes the highlights noted above compel me to give December Boys a decent rating in particular the scenic rockscoast and Lucy.If you like Teresa Palmer in this picture be sure to check her out in Bedtime Stories 2008 Restraint 2008 and The Grudge 2 2006.The film runs 1 hour 45 minutes.GRADE BB".

It quickly moves from the sublime to the ridiculous when the orphans are smoking after lights out. The head nun tells four orphans they are going on beach holiday due to a donation and you wonder why the rest of the orphans miss out. On the way to the beach holiday the children are heard to say Let's cross swords as they cross their urinating streams by a roadside break and I realize the scriptwriter has little conception of how Australian boys talk and behave. We then see the boys at a circus where they see 1980's BMX motor bikes in daredevil stunts but it's the sixties and you would have to conclude the director is an idiot. The film becomes a narrative of one of the boys wearing glasses and they arrive at the beach begin an unsupervised frolicking escapade. He the sees a black horse and it leads them to the beach where a topless girl emerges from the water and introduces herself in a Mexican accent. You then realize she is what appears to be a French family running the supposed to a beach resort. Daniel Radcliffe plays Maps and appears much taller and older than the other boys and is withdrawn .A Man appears on a Triumph motorcycle looking like his from the eighties. He the take the bespectacled boy for a dangerous stunt ride on his shoulders whilst riding his motor bike on sand. During this symbolised coming of age film we hear Australian rock hits from the seventies. Its further evidence that Australians can't make films and doesn't make any sense the dialogue is ridiculous. The other boys are drinking by now we see the horse with a fish in its Radcliffe's character is already smoking and probably already having sex with the blond Lucy. We see a horse with a fish in its mouth and see a silly adoption story. It only get worse from that point and is a waste of Australian taxpayers money. Acting woeful  Minus five stars.".

	schema:headline " Nice comingofage story of four Australian orphaned boys.";
	schema:reviewBody "Most of the movie takes place on small beach of vacation cabins on the South Australia coast but it begins in the vast featureless spaces of the Australian Outback the location of this boys town run by nuns. One feature of the way the orphanage operates boys are recognized as a group during the month of their birthday so these 4 boys are known as the December Boys. This December they get a special treat because a donation has been made and the 4 of them are being sent on holiday to stay with a family during the Christmas break on this tidy little beach community. Remember Christmas in Australia is summertime. Having mostly experienced life in the Outback when it rains a lot and floods we can go fishing. these 4 boys are confronted with all kinds of surprises in the small coastal community. There is the childless married lady who comes out of the water topless to greet the boys. One of them faints. There is the precocious teenage girl who has a secret hideaway among the rocks that she calls her Stonehenge and hints that aliens may have constructed it although it looks like centuries of Ocean sculpting. And there is the old fisherman fishing for Henry Is that a person or a type of fish? the old large fish that visits the bay.The movie is narrated in modern time by the adult character we come to know as Misty. Jusdging from Misty's current age the story must have been set in the late 1950s or the 1960s. Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame is Maps because he has birthmarks on his chest that looks like maps. Lee Cormie is Misty who appears to be about 12 in the movie. Christian Byers is Sparks and James Fraser is Spit because his dad flew a Spitfire. The teenage girl is cute Teresa Palmer as Lucy. Sullivan Stapleton is Fearless married to Victoria Hill as Teresa. They can't have children so begin talking about adopting one of the 4 boys. Misty overhears this and much of the last half of the movie has the boys in silent competition to see who might be chosen. This is a very big deal because it was very hard for any of these boys to be adopted.A very nice little movie it has a realistic feel and is a coming of age experience for the 4 boys.SPOILERS Maps is the oldest of the boys and often takes a big brother role. He is very naive in the ways of the world and especially with girls. Lucy recognizes that and becomes his teacher since she has affection for him. She becomes his first in her hideaway. Towards the end of the movie the childless couple announce they have chosen Misty to adopt and the three of them watch as the other 3 boys wander away. Misty realizes that his family really is the group of 4 December Boys and he affectionately tells the young couple thanks for choosing him but he really belongs with the family he already has.The movie ends in modern time and we see Max Cullen as the Narrator and the Adult Misty. We learn that Maps after his experience with Lucy and having a vision underwater while saving Misty actually became a Priest. All 3 surviving December Boys met at the seaside getaway with Maps' ashes so they could be scattered on that hillside where the 4 of them had the bonding experience years earlier. Note It is not consistent with Roman Catholic practice to scatter ashes especially for a Priest.".

You can't say that this director is as good as Tim Burton but he sure has great quality that he can and hopefully will develop and go big.This movie is worth seeing no talk about it. I can't understand why people rate this 110 because this piece of work is not worth it.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Ladykillers 1955 is an enduring classic of British cinema. It was far and away Ealing's finest hour as a studio. Smooth polished and blackly funny its one of the best British comedies ever made. Now the classic tale gets the 21st Century makeover from Ethan and Joel Coen.The basic story is just as Ealing left it. Five men plan a robbery while posing as musicians for the little old lady putting them up. She eventually finds the money and the gang have no choice but to bump her off. But everything that can and will go wrong does. Ealing comedies have always been a big influence on the Coen Brothers. Especially The Ladykillers. They love to make films where hapless folk fall victim to cruel and unusual circumstances. The Ladykillers should have worked really well in their hands. What a crushing disappointment that it doesn't. The Coens have made many marvellous films over the years. But this is one film on they're resume that misfires.The Coens' have radically reworked the story to suit themselves. E.g. A pet cat instead of pet parrots bodies dumped into garbage barges and not train carriages. And the Deep South as a setting. I have nothing against changes. The mark of a good remake is to take the original story and find some new novelty on it. But its the approach the Coens' take that kills the story.Much of the appeal of the original film was the way it took place in a cosy English domestic setting. Beneath a placid demeanour was a very sinister crime story. As violence and murder began to spiral it pushed the film from the blackly comical into the truly hysterical.The anonymity of the original made the violence in it that much more disturbing. And that all the more funny. But the mistake of the Coens' is to make it disturbing but not to rein any of it in.Coen films are frequently bizarre. But its an approach that doesn't sit very well with the story. Alec Guinness' Professor Marcus was hardly normal. You could tell that just by looking at him. But he didn't have to do much to convince you of that. One of the major problems with the remake is the way the Coens' have rewritten his character. Professor Marcus has now become Professor G.H. Dorr Ph.d. This was Tom Hanks' first time out with the Coen Brothers and in interviews he said he'd never seen the original film. If he had I can guarantee he wouldn't have wanted to do a remake. Because the original film was perfect. The remake only reminds you of how well written and well acted the original was.Tom Hanks' performance is more distracting than it is engaging. He plays the role with a series of peculiar squeaks grunts and doubletakes. Its impossible to form a connection with such an unusual character. Hanks draws too much attention to himself. Where Alec Guinness was more subtle. He could communicate volumes with a simple look.The other members of the gang are not much better either. We care little for these people. And like Hanks they're much too bizarre to identify with. Considering they're supposed to be criminals trying to keep a low profile it just doesn't make any sense that the Coens' play up their quirks to shrieking absurd levels.One thing that seriously works against the film is Marlon Wayans. I must admit to an intense dislike of him as an actor. His performances are annoyingly over the top. And The Ladykillers is no exception. He spends half the time swearing his way through the film. He does more swearing than he does talking. Which feels out of step with the rest of the film. Every time he's on the scene I wanted to leave the room. I was relieved when he was killed off. The film is all the better for it.An otherwise fine actor like JK Simmons is wasted. He doesn't get much to do and his irritable bowel syndrome isn't nearly as funny as the Coens' think it is. Tzi Ma and Ryan Hurst make no distinction on the story at all. They're not the smooth attuned ensemble Guinness' gang were.In the role of the little old lady instead of Mrs Wilberforce we have Mrs Munson played by Irma P. Hall. Her sassy energetic presence is the one ray of sunshine to the film. She's the one thing about the remake the Coens' get right. She's an amusing reversal of what we were expecting. Not too knowing. But not too naive either.The film is slightly more successful in its second half. As soon as it gets to the point where they have to kill Mrs Munson off it forces the Coens' to stop springing oddball quirks on us and get on with telling the story. A point where the Coens' trademark black humour finally starts paying off. They die just like the last time with Mrs Munson completely none the wiser. But the Coens' put they're own sadistic spin on them. Tzi Ma's death is particularly hilarious.But that's all of 30 minutes before the credits roll. And that's too late in the film to save it. And even then we never get the feeling that things are getting worse by the second the way we did with the Ealing version. Or the way the Coens' did with Fargo. They fortunately recovered with their next film the superb No Country For Old Men. But if that film showed the Coens' at their best The Ladykillers is them at their worst.".

Where else can you find a garbage barge and a garbage dump transformed so magically by the movie camera into what looks like an idyllic paradise. Equally sparkling is the audio pleasure proffered with the beautiful background of barbershop like chorus leading into an on screen duet of snores of the sheriff and his deputy. While on that score no pun intended lively exciting swinging gospel music provides excellent interludes as well as background throughout. Knowing that this is a remake of a 1955 version lead by Alec Gunnies I'll make no further reference to something that I have not had the pleasure of watching. Instead I would make reference to the assembling of the team for the caper an enjoyable prologue as found in many similar films from the good old classic The League of Gentlemen to the more recent Italian Job also a remake. The slight difference here is that instead of seeing the mastermind Tom Hanks actually recruiting each one of them we are shown what looks like a cartoon quip of each with some good laughs but at the same time highlighting their individual characteristics.Tunnelling for a robbery is not new and the classical one has to be The Red Headed League in the Sherlock Holmes short stores. Here under the pretext of researching Renaissance music Hanks and company rent the basement of a widow played by Irma P. Hall. One source of amusement to the audience comes from the scenes between these two the churchgoing Southern black woman whose every nuance overflows with simple principled honesty but earthly smartness and the completely cunning crook who tries to wriggle out of her recognition at every twist and turn. Another contrast played upon a lot by the Coen Brothers is the Hanks' talking 'genteel' as Eliza Doolittle would have said and the proliferation of obscenity from the 'punk' the insider member of the gang.Funny right from the start this movie gradually reveals more and more of the Coens' brand of dark humour when eventually the title 'ladykillers' take on a literal meaning. An 'In competition' film at Cannes this year this Coen gem is well worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not as bad a bad movie as many other would seem to want you to believe. It does not really bear comparison to the original because it has been made differently and updated for a modern audience. Tom Hanks contrary to other comments I have seen here is quite excellent in the lead role. His hammy Poeesquire disguise is clearly compensating for the lack of intellectual gravity to which he so anxiously aspires. And although I understand that Hanks did not watch the original prior to filming it is a neat coincidence then that he chose to insert false teeth see Alistair Simm in the original. The supporting characters are nicely fleshed out with some helpful introductory vignettes and although some of the film comes across as a little too Uncle Tom's Cabin at times I think we can forgive the Cohens. There are some great laugh out loud moments of pure slapstick and some nice subtle touches of more gentle humour. This does not stack up against some of the more lauded of the Cohen's work  Fargo  Barton Fink  but it is an enjoyable and worthwhile slice of cinematic time. Beware of plenty of uneccesary bad language.".

For the greatest plot idea can become mundane if you've put the wrong character in the wrong place. Joel and Ethan Coen's THE LADYKILLERS is a mundane story that is saved by top notch and very rich performances. Mrs. Munson Irma P. Hall Soul Food is a simple woman. She lives at home alone she goes to church every Sunday and she prays for the souls of those young kids listening to that Hippity Hoppity music. So when she rents a room to Professor Dorr P.H.D Tom Hanks Philadelphia little does she know that her annual contribution to Bob Jones University will never be the same.Dorr turns out to be a criminal mastermind trying to pull off a simple casino robbery. He's acquired a crack team of losers and creeps to pull it off Gaiwan Marlon Wayans Dungeons and Dragons The Inside Man Garth Pancake J.K. Simmons The First Wives Club The Munitions Expert The General Tzi Ma The Quiet American the tactical man and Lump Ryan Hurst Patch Adams is the muscle. Will they pull off their brilliant plan? Only time and the twohour running time will tell.What the Coen's have crafted here is an acquired taste. The comedy is a little bit esoteric. The story plods along with almost reckless abandon and they use swear words like their trying to buy a Ferrari with their swear jar. But something else is going on under the surface a great character drama is unfolding.Hank's overplays Dorr but only to hide the fact that he might not be nearly as smart as he might claims. It's so subtle and yet so garish I could see many thinking the performance is too over the top. But Hanks plays it so smartly and charming you can't help but be enveloped into its complex layers. I also liked how the Coen's screenplay polarizes it characters by playing the actors against each other. Dorr and Munson relationship works because it's the classic battle between brains and innocence. You may be able to quote Edgar Allen Poe but if you can't do the right thing maybe you should get a real job. The other great struggle is between Gaiwan and Garth. Gaiwan is a young black male with no conscience. Garth is a liberal white guy trying to knock sense into this stupid kid. Their escalating story builds from an almost a playful game of Older Vs Younger but then raises the bar as it escalates into violence. The Coen's have always had limited appeal because their films are dependent on audience involvement. You have to care for the characters you have to put yourself in the characters place. Those who don't will leave the theater going that was weird that was stupid and that didn't make any sense. But that's why I like their films so much.THE LADYKILLERS is worth the price of admission if you're interested in a silly and subtle characterdrama but fails in plot. But boy it's a lot of fun and if you give it a chance you might just walk away without that look of confusion you had on your face after THE HUDSUCKER PROXY. out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "My recollection of the original THE LADYKILLERS is somewhat shaky but I remember it to be a whimsical little comedy one of those delightfully British films that celebrate English eccentricity even in its dark and slightly murderous extremes. Made in 1955 and featuring such wonderful talents as Alec Guinness Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom it has earned a reputation as a minor classic.One can only assume that the Coen Brothers never saw the original or if they did they decided that to Americanize the tale they had to strip it of anything that might even vaguely seem whimsical  or funny. As if to reinforce the continental notion that Americans are vulgar their woefully inept remake wallows in tastelessness. The film does display the Coens' penchant for striking visuals and offers up moments here and there of genteel ghoulishness but it's all superficial style. Beneath that facade the film is cruel and ugly and hateful and really quite racist. For no particular reason this tired tale about thieves tunneling into a vault has been transported to the Mississippi Delta and populated with a cast of characters trapped in racial stereotyping of every sort.Doing a crude parody of a southern gentleman Tom Hanks plays unpleasantly against type as Prof. Goldthwait Higginson Dorr Ph.D. a con man who finagles his way into a boarding house ran by Irma P. Hall as Mrs. Marva Munson. He hopes to commandeer her basement as the starting point for a tunnel into the counting house of a nearby casino. Never mind that his inside man already has inexplicably easy access to the poorly guarded vault making the need for the tunnel questionable. Anyway the plot is tired and predictable but workable if approached with a sense of clever good cheer as proved by Woody Allen's SMALL TIME CROOKS. But that is not to be in this case the Coens  Ethan and Joel codirecting and cowriting  try hamhandedly to blend macabre wit with the obscenityladen ethnic humor of black exploitation films. As such the film is constantly shifting back and forth in tone.The stereotyping of Mrs. Munson as a nononsense Biblethumping dowager is broad and at times rather than being naive and slightly dotty she seems just plain stupid. She thinks Ph.D. is the spelling of Elmer Fudd's last name that's how desperate the humor gets. But Mrs. Munson is relatively inoffensive compared to the grotesque caricatures the film makes of the other characters. Especially offensive is Marlon Wayons' foulmouthed Gawain an utterly moronic homeboy who seems to have drunkenly stumbled in from the set of SCARY MOVIE his only function in the film is to insert multiple achingly unfunny obscenities into every single sentence he utters. I suppose he is also meant to represent a contrast to the churchgoing gospelsinging members of Mrs. Munson's congregation but the juxtaposition of gospel and hiphop the sacred and the profane serves no purpose other than to present two equally clichd vision of African Americans. The Coens patronizes southern blacks while also pandering to the lowest level rap music mentality.What should have been a family friendly comedy develops into an Rrated insult. Wayons' unrelentingly filthy language is matched with jokes about bowel movements and a painfully unfunny gag about a dog suffocating. The only character worthy of sympathy is Ryan Hurst as the hatefully named Lump Hudson a braindamaged football players who is utterly irrelevant to the story except to be condescendingly laughed at for being dumb. And doesn't it say something that the Coens once celebrated for their adult wit and sophisticated approach have fallen to the pathetic level of naming a character Lump just to get an easy laugh? By the time the film takes a murderous twist it is difficult to care about anyone. I assume that Hanks' Prof. Dorr is supposed to be a lovable scalawag but his posturing demeanor is as annoying as his compulsive snickering laughter none of Hanks' natural charm seeps through. His band of cohorts are callous and onedimensional. Even Mrs. Munson begins to grate on one's nerves as she proves to be a dullwitted bully.What is missing from the film is a sense of innocence. The Coens have proved they know how to embrace malevolence but not since BLOOD SIMPLE have they shown the devilish wit of Alfred Hitchcock or Tim Burton or Charles Addams or Edward Gory or even Edgar Allen Poe. In their inexplicable attempt to mix modern film sadism with quaint British irony they let the former suffocate the latter and like the poor dog in the film THE LADYKILLERS dies a slow and painfully unpleasant death.".

Especially offensive is Marlon Wayons' foulmouthed Gawain an utterly moronic homeboy who seems to have drunkenly stumbled in from the set of SCARY MOVIE his only function in the film is to insert multiple achingly unfunny obscenities into every single sentence he utters. I suppose he is also meant to represent a contrast to the churchgoing gospelsinging members of Mrs. Munson's congregation but the juxtaposition of gospel and hiphop the sacred and the profane serves no purpose other than to present two equally clichd vision of African Americans. The Coens patronizes southern blacks while also pandering to the lowest level rap music mentality.What should have been a family friendly comedy develops into an Rrated insult. Wayons' unrelentingly filthy language is matched with jokes about bowel movements and a painfully unfunny gag about a dog suffocating. The only character worthy of sympathy is Ryan Hurst as the hatefully named Lump Hudson a braindamaged football players who is utterly irrelevant to the story except to be condescendingly laughed at for being dumb. And doesn't it say something that the Coens once celebrated for their adult wit and sophisticated approach have fallen to the pathetic level of naming a character Lump just to get an easy laugh? By the time the film takes a murderous twist it is difficult to care about anyone. I assume that Hanks' Prof. Dorr is supposed to be a lovable scalawag but his posturing demeanor is as annoying as his compulsive snickering laughter none of Hanks' natural charm seeps through. His band of cohorts are callous and onedimensional. Even Mrs. Munson begins to grate on one's nerves as she proves to be a dullwitted bully.What is missing from the film is a sense of innocence. The Coens have proved they know how to embrace malevolence but not since BLOOD SIMPLE have they shown the devilish wit of Alfred Hitchcock or Tim Burton or Charles Addams or Edward Gory or even Edgar Allen Poe. In their inexplicable attempt to mix modern film sadism with quaint British irony they let the former suffocate the latter and like the poor dog in the film THE LADYKILLERS dies a slow and painfully unpleasant death.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have loved all the Coen brother movies but unfortunately this one was a let down. It kills me to write this but here is my analysis of what went wrong...The Actors  Production Team did not Share the Same Vision.......and it shows on screen. The tone of the scenes and characters are wildly uneven. The movie feels like it was pasted together from other movies of unrelated genres and time periods.The odd combinations of mixed era costumes and set interiors are visually distracting. It takes awhile to figure out what time period the story is supposed to be set in. When introduced to Tom Hank's character it appears the movie will be set in the 1920's but then you meet his landlady and she is an artifact of the 1950's. Then suddenly you are jerked to a casino scene that feels like outtakes from an Ice Cube Friday movie. The only cohesive element is that all the characters are underdeveloped stereotypes. Typically the Coens write quirky characters that are meant to be played full tilt boogie but here lack of a developed script leaves the actors running amok. Although the actors try to compensate their overwrought performances just amplify the offensiveness of the humorless material. Hanks' performance as Professor Dorr might have been fun in a short SNL sketch but his overthetop delivery is hard to take for longer than five minutes. His mugging and affectations are blown even more out of proportion when viewed in the theater or on a big screen. It is quite like watching the antics of a precocious kid who annoys everyone but his loveblind parents. While Hanks may have amused the Coen brothers it isn't working on scene. The story might have looked funny on paper but by the time it reached the big screen Tom Hanks had taken the Coen Brother's hostage. Hanks character interpretation looks like it evolved in a bubble cut off from his fellow actors and unrelated to the stylistic tone of the surrounding production. The effect is jarring and frustrating to watch. The Step'in Fetchit and Mammy era shtick is painfully unfunny. The casino scenes lack the usual Coen whimsy. Visually it feels like you accidentally clicked over to another movie. If you are looking for the usual Coen Brothers whimsy you may wish to skip this one and save yourself the disappointment. I can recommend this movie ONLY to people that enjoy dogging on movies that missed the mark. In that sense it is a good candidate for the athome game of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Invite over a few friends and swap smartass comments about movie while you view it.".

Actually calling the Coens' The Ladykillers an awful dreadful unfunny mess is being unkind to films that are really awful dreadful and unfunny.This remake ranks right alongside Gus Van Sant's Psycho as the worst remake of a classic. The Coens have taken a marvelously droll and brilliantly understated and charming black comedy and turned it into a broad charmless and crude excuse for a comedy.Tom Hanks hams it the whole way. There's not a single funny moment in his entire performance. He could win the Best Actor Oscar every year for the next 25 years and wouldn't amount to half the superb actor Sir Alec Guinness was. And as much as I like Irma P. Hall the Coens got her character completely wrong.What made the original so good was sweet Mrs. Wilberforce's played by the incomparable Katie Johnson naivete and vulnerability. The Coens have transformed her into a toughtalking woman without an ounce of vulnerability and the story loses all its charm and humor. Hall's character just doesn't work in this story.Marlon Wayans grates as the foulmouthed inside man  unable to extract any humor from their remake the Coens resort to Wayans spewing profanity pretty much in every line of dialogue. I have no problem with profanity but here it's just not funny. And where the profanity doesn't work the Coens believe bathroom humor will by giving a character Irritable Bowel Syndrome. This is what Ethan and Joel have been reduced to. The guys who've given us some of the best films in the last 20 years have sunk to this level?The Coens' film has only two minor things going for it a a lovely cat named Pickles and b a terrific gospel soundtrack. Save yourself the trouble  buy the soundtrack CD and rent Alexander Mackendrick's original on DVD. It's only March and the Coens have already given us one of the worst films of the year. We can only hope they got the remake bug out of their system. Unless of course since they are after all the Coens they're planning on remaking The Bicycle Thief  in color because De Sica didn't get it quite right the first time.".

What happened???Several others have commented on the jarring changes in tone  this is a major problem. The scenes with the old lady evoke a 50's feeling then suddenly you're in a casino with the Fword spouting every 5 seconds. What the heck is that?? What's the need for all the cursing at all? It's just not funny.Tom Hanks is a mess. I think it's the script mainly the majority of his lines are confusing mush. I read somewhere that he didn't view the original before making this but his sniveling laugh sure looks like a poor imitation of Alec Guinness's monstrously funny snickers. You even get a little of the teeth movement but again nothing to compare with Guinness. The other characters are uninspired  not as well drawn as the originals with the exception perhaps of The General who came off pretty well. It's hard to compete with Herbert Lom  Peter Sellars of course but couldn't they come up with anything better than this? The munitions guy was the worst yes more than Marlon Wayons' stereotyped role and his irritable bowel syndrome....gee nothing like toilet humor to bring on the laughs!! You just don't care about these guys!Lastly the old lady character was okay but no match for Katie Johnson in the original. She was too sharp too strong. Most of the humor in the original came from the old lady being so dottily sweet mild and seemingly frail. You could see why the police thought she was a little daft. Not so with the new character I didn't buy it at all.Don't waste your money on this one. Go for the original and while you're at it try some of the other Ealing comedies too.".

	schema:headline " Fun variation on a comedy classic";
	schema:reviewBody "The original The Ladykillers is one of my favorite comedies a gleefully macabre and witty classic with some outstanding performances especially Alec Guinness' hysterical performance. It was also distinctively British. Now I am not nearly as annoyed by remakes as many other filmgoers are I merely find most of them unnecessary and hence avoid most of them. The only ones I respect are those that attempt to do something different. The Coens are probably my favorite living directors and among the more distinctive currently working and they certainly put their own spin on an established comedy classic with this film.I think that the poor reception this film got is largely due to its sense of humor. The Coens' dry wit present in several of their films is present here mostly through the main character Professor Dorr portrayed excellently by Tom Hanks in one of his better performances but there's also a lot of lowbrow humor and not even distinctive or interesting lowbrow humor just 'haha he dropped an fbomb' sort which is really at odds with the rest of this film. Really take out Marlon Wayans and his annoying character and you would have one of the best remakes ever made. Instead you've got this film.The Ladykillers in spite of its awful reputation is really not a bad film at all. It's got atmosphere it's beautifully photographed it's fairly amusing and the majority of the performances are very good. It's inferior by the Coens' standards but still better than most comedies released in 2004. In addition although it takes a lot of liberties with the original story it recreates the most memorable sequences from the original with care and obvious affection resulting in a hugely entertaining last twenty minutes in which so many memorable images from Mackendrick's classic Ealing comedy are translated to the American south. This is a minor film for the Coens but obviously one made with love and affection. It's fairly flawed but it's also quite amusing and features and outstanding performance from Tom Hanks an actor I don't normally think is particularly great. 710".

It was also distinctively British. Now I am not nearly as annoyed by remakes as many other filmgoers are I merely find most of them unnecessary and hence avoid most of them.

	schema:headline " NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE  FOR YOUNG ADULTS AND OLDER";
	schema:reviewBody "The Blue Lagoon 1980 is so very close to the book Blue Lagoon A Romance written in 1907 by H. de Vere Stacpoole and published in January 1908.  The actual book is on the Internet and the dialog in the movie is faithful to the book.  Some dismiss the movie as trivial.  However consider this.  Brooke Christa Shields was 14 years old born 1966 when she played Emmeline LeStrange. She had already appeared in 12 prior films.  Christopher Atkins was making his movie debut at the age of 18 years born 1962 playing Emmeline's cousin Richard LeStrange referred in the book by the diminutive name Dicky LeStrange.  In the book Emmeline is 8 years old and Dicky is 8 years and a bit when the story starts.  Emmeline's father died before she was born.  Two years later her mother died.  Her uncle and father's brother Arthur LeStrange veteran actor William Daniels took guardianship of Emmeline in Boston.  Mr. LeStrange purchased a small estate in Los Angeles and was in route by clipper ship to San Francisco around South America.  The ship named Northcumberland had departed from New Orleans bound for San Francisco.  Having rounded the Cape of South America and going off course during a calm a fire breaks out in the hull of the ship. The cook Paddy Button played expertly by veteran Australian actor Leo McKern took Emmeline and Dicky aboard a dinghy launch and attempted to row a safe distance away from the ship before it exploded from gunpowder stored on board.  Mr. LeStrange and ships' compliment were separated in the fog from Paddy Emmeline and Dicky after the ship blew up.  Mr. Button and the children drifted in the South Pacific Ocean for about three days and nights until they were brought by the tide to an island named in the book as Palm Tree Island somewhere in the ocean southeast of the Marquesas Islands.  In the movie we see a Boston newspaper with a date that appears to be 1893 floating in the water.  The children and Paddy Button are saved and set up housekeeping as shipwrecked survivors.  For the first 45 minutes of the movie child actors Elva Josephson and Glenn Kohan play Emmeline and Dicky.  Elva only acted in three movies and two TV appearances while Glenn appeared in this film only and acted no more.  However they did a good job playing themselves as eightyearolds.  On the island Paddy tries to be father and mother to the children.  He teaches them the basics of survival gathering fresh water harvesting bananas from trees catching fresh ocean fish capturing small rabbits knot tying hut building making a signal fire making a tree calendar to mark the days and exploring the flora and fauna and caves of the island.  They had rescued a trunk of clothes that the children use as dress up and play items.  Also there were threedimension view photos of the day of adults in social activities.  These photos would be useful to educate Emmeline and Dicky in some social graces of civilized people. Emmeline had found a keg of rum and a skeleton of another shipwrecked sailor when they first arrived on the island.  After two years on the island Paddy drinks himself to death.  It is curious that this small keg would have lasted for two years being the rummy that Paddy was as he tells the children that he has many children in ports around the world.  However the children discover Paddy's dead body and conduct a burial ceremony as best as they could.  Don't look for this on the TBS edited for content version as it's not there.  TBS spoils the movie by cutting out what they feel are sensitive parts of the movie albeit necessary for continuity of the story to retain its TV 14 rating.  This is not a children's movie.  This is a young adult's movie.  The rudimentary scenes are necessary to be faithful to the book!  If the rating ends up being R so be it.  Also this is far from being a soft porn movie as some reviewers suggest.  This is a story about how people can survive in the late 1800s on a deserted South Pacific Island without the niceties of the then civilized western world.Enter teens Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins at about the age of 14 years.  The story picks up as the children have entered into puberty. Brooke Emmeline begins to become aware of her changing body turning her into a woman and she experiences these changes alone and confused without another woman to help educate her.  Likewise Chris Dicky is becoming a man and Brooke although the same age in the story is more mature than Chris and is becoming sexually attracted to Chris' emerging manhood.  What was once child's play and tickletouch between children is now sexually sensitive to young emerging teens.  Critics  this is Nature at work!  The moviemakers did a wonderful job of portraying this on film. Of course they discover sex.  But they do not know that it produces children.  Emmeline and Dicky marry each other in a ceremony they devise to show that they are civilized.  They begin to live together as husband and wife.  Ultimately Emmeline becomes pregnant and finally is aware that there is something growing within her.  Fast forward to the Bogeymen on the other side of the island.  A tribe of natives had from time to time come by boat to the other side of the island.  Here they had a stone idol and sacrificial alter.  At least six times during the film even when Paddy was still alive the survivors heard distant drumbeats.  Paddy knew the danger and passed a law warning the children never to go to the other side of the island.  After Paddy's death Emmeline and Dicky do go to the other side and discover the idol.  Emmeline thinks it is God.  The edited version leaves out the night spying and confrontation of Dicky with a native.  Get the full version for this humane meeting of East meets West.  Oh these are not African peoples. This is a South Pacific movie.  The natives are supposed to be Polynesians.In the book Emmeline has her child all alone on the floor of the forest while Dicky is returning from spying on the Natives.  In the movie Dicky returns in the nick of time to witness the child's birth.  No matter. That's Hollywood's movie license.Of course Uncle Richard has continued to pursue finding his son and niece. The book explains how he comes to know where the children might be.  He hires a ship to search the area of the Palm Tree Island.  Ultimately Emmeline Dicky and baby Paddy now about 2 years old   in the book she names the boy child a girls name Hannah because she likes the name put out to sea in the dinghy that is still seaworthy after being shipwrecked for eight years and five months.  After losing their oars during a shark attack the survivors without food or water drift in the ocean for three days before Uncle Richard discovers them.  The movie ends as faithful to the book ending.  The trio is rescued.  When the rescue boat rows out to intercept the dinghy Mr. LeStrange asks Are they dead?  The ship's crewman replies No they're asleep.Beautiful Brooke and handsome Chris are not to be made fun of.   They acted remarkably well portraying children with limited education and vocabulary. The island scenery is beautifully photographed.  There is a wonderful special effect when Brooke baths in the ocean.  Get the video as TBS took a hatchet to these frames.  If you were living in that era and shipwrecked and survived you would want your eight plus years on the island to be like Brooke and Chris spent in this film.  Get the video and enjoy.  It's an adult film for mature teens and older adults.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Blue Lagoon 1980 is so very close to the book Blue Lagoon A Romance written in 1907 by H. de Vere Stacpoole and published in January 1908.  The actual book is on the Internet and the dialog in the movie is faithful to the book.  Some dismiss the movie as trivial.  However consider this.  Brooke Christa Shields was 14 years old born 1966 when she played Emmeline LeStrange. She had already appeared in 12 prior films.  Christopher Atkins was making his movie debut at the age of 18 years born 1962 playing Emmeline's cousin Richard LeStrange referred in the book by the diminutive name Dicky LeStrange.  In the book Emmeline is 8 years old and Dicky is 8 years and a bit when the story starts.  Emmeline's father died before she was born.  Two years later her mother died.  Her uncle and father's brother Arthur LeStrange veteran actor William Daniels took guardianship of Emmeline in Boston.  Mr. LeStrange purchased a small estate in Los Angeles and was in route by clipper ship to San Francisco around South America.  The ship named Northcumberland had departed from New Orleans bound for San Francisco.  Having rounded the Cape of South America and going off course during a calm a fire breaks out in the hull of the ship. The cook Paddy Button played expertly by veteran Australian actor Leo McKern took Emmeline and Dicky aboard a dinghy launch and attempted to row a safe distance away from the ship before it exploded from gunpowder stored on board.  Mr. LeStrange and ships' compliment were separated in the fog from Paddy Emmeline and Dicky after the ship blew up.  Mr. Button and the children drifted in the South Pacific Ocean for about three days and nights until they were brought by the tide to an island named in the book as Palm Tree Island somewhere in the ocean southeast of the Marquesas Islands.  In the movie we see a Boston newspaper with a date that appears to be 1893 floating in the water.  The children and Paddy Button are saved and set up housekeeping as shipwrecked survivors.  For the first 45 minutes of the movie child actors Elva Josephson and Glenn Kohan play Emmeline and Dicky.  Elva only acted in three movies and two TV appearances while Glenn appeared in this film only and acted no more.  However they did a good job playing themselves as eightyearolds.  On the island Paddy tries to be father and mother to the children.  He teaches them the basics of survival gathering fresh water harvesting bananas from trees catching fresh ocean fish capturing small rabbits knot tying hut building making a signal fire making a tree calendar to mark the days and exploring the flora and fauna and caves of the island.  They had rescued a trunk of clothes that the children use as dress up and play items.  Also there were threedimension view photos of the day of adults in social activities.  These photos would be useful to educate Emmeline and Dicky in some social graces of civilized people. Emmeline had found a keg of rum and a skeleton of another shipwrecked sailor when they first arrived on the island.  After two years on the island Paddy drinks himself to death.  It is curious that this small keg would have lasted for two years being the rummy that Paddy was as he tells the children that he has many children in ports around the world.  However the children discover Paddy's dead body and conduct a burial ceremony as best as they could.  Don't look for this on the TBS edited for content version as it's not there.

Remember that Nestor Almendros received an Academy Award nomination for his work on this film. The film has resonated with global audiences for so long for this very reason. I suggest people watch the dvd commentary with Randal Kleiser and Brooke Shields to get a better understanding of why this film is still such a popular one.People attack the acting but these are children left alone with no one to guide them into adult sophistication. Their interaction and reactions to situations are very consistent with this scenario. Yes the birth scene is a little rushed but do we really need to see the umbilical cord? Not all films need to be about gritty reality ala Taxi Driver.

Brooke is a beautiful talented actress. The scenery was just gorgeous it makes you want to fly off to Fiji where they filmed most of the movie to see what it is really like. The music is also very good. The story starts out with a ship which catches fire and everyone is forced to abandon ship. Two young children Richard and Emmeline as well as a drunken cook named Paddy get on a lifeboat together and drift on the sea for many days until they discover land a bunch of little remote tropical islands. They build a home there. Time passes and Paddy passes away but Richard and Emmeline continue growing up together. They get older and new feelings come over them. They discover many things about adolescence and sex. This is a great love story sweet and lovable. Brooke and Chris make a great onscreen couple. The sexnudity scenes are not really that bad at all they're rather mild. There is more nudity in the underwater swimming sequences but mostly all of that was done by Brooke's standin a professional diver. I really like this movie and even though there are a few logic loopholes it is still enjoyable. My only complaint I think this film could've gone on for about 5 more mins. or so and explained things a little bit better.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was a young kid when I saw THE BLUE LAGOON and yes I remember all the hoopla about the nude scenes with Brooke Shields and all that jazz. I must confess that being in my early teens at the time I saw this there was an inherent morbidity which compelled me to watch Brooke Shields in the nude. After all she was probably THE hottest teen actress of the early 80's and damn she DID look terrific!. But now I'm in my late 30's and I have recently seen the film once again and I must confess BLUE LAGOON is a darn good movie. Yeah it might be corny in some parts but so what?!?! It's a cute love story that's very well done and done in a very realistic and believable way. It's the story of two kids who are stranded on a supposedly deserted island in the middle of the pacific ocean and that they have to grow up and learn the things of life by themselves. Yes there's plenty of nudity but that's not the charm of this movie which I recall was nominated for best cinematography in 1981. The real deal is the story of these 2 kids growing up and reaching adulthood on their own primitive terms. The soundtrack is rich and heartfelt by maestro Basil Poledouris and only enhances the overall grandeur of this film. I think Chirs Atkins did a great acting job and I have to wonder why his acting career has faded into near obscurity. And Brooke Shields looks like a total goddess she is REALLY beautiful in this movie and I doubt she's looked better elsewhere. I fully recommend this movie especially to young couples the recently married or just plain love birds. younger audiences might find it a bit corny but like I said this movie is pure entertainment and despite not being an action flick it never bores. You'll do no wrong in watching or better yet owning THE BLUE LAGOON on DVD!".

	onyx:emotionText "I was a young kid when I saw THE BLUE LAGOON and yes I remember all the hoopla about the nude scenes with Brooke Shields and all that jazz. I must confess that being in my early teens at the time I saw this there was an inherent morbidity which compelled me to watch Brooke Shields in the nude. After all she was probably THE hottest teen actress of the early 80's and damn she DID look terrific!. But now I'm in my late 30's and I have recently seen the film once again and I must confess BLUE LAGOON is a darn good movie. Yeah it might be corny in some parts but so what?!?! It's a cute love story that's very well done and done in a very realistic and believable way. It's the story of two kids who are stranded on a supposedly deserted island in the middle of the pacific ocean and that they have to grow up and learn the things of life by themselves. Yes there's plenty of nudity but that's not the charm of this movie which I recall was nominated for best cinematography in 1981. The real deal is the story of these 2 kids growing up and reaching adulthood on their own primitive terms. The soundtrack is rich and heartfelt by maestro Basil Poledouris and only enhances the overall grandeur of this film.

The concept is great of two people alone growing up without civilization to guide them. Most people's issue with this movie is the dialogue. Come on! They were left alone at like 8. Your body matures people but not so your mind. Would it have made any sense if they were speaking like intelligent teenagers without benefit of education? No. The movie was realistic with the constant nudity and the childlike innocence of the two characters. Brooke Shields is awesome. I loved her in this movie. This was when she was at her best. Atkins did a great job as well. I know if I was on that island I'd be naked a lot as well. It was just really put together nicely. The scenes with the water and the aquatic life was really gorgeous.

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason the rating of this movie is very lowrated. I don't really see much to hate about this movie. It's such a sweet movie.The Blue Lagoon takes place in the early 1900's. It's about a boy named Richard Christopher Atkins a girl named EmmelineBrooke Shields and a cook who become stranded on an island after the ship was on fire they got separated from the crew after that.As they are on the island the cook teaches them how to make fire tie knots for making shelter cooking etc. But later on the cook dies and Richard  Emmeline have to live on their own.Years later they grow very beautifully. But as their bodies change their emotions change too. They have fights sometimes but later they fall in love. And they also have a child later on.The thing I like about this movie is the way a boy  a girl are portrayed when they are alone on an island together. It was nice to see how both of them develop in their teenage years both of them have noticeable bodily changes and they start to react differently to one another. They eventually discover the secret of love and finally have a child not knowing how they made the child.Some of the highlights of the movie are the various scenes of Richard  Emmeline swimming naked in the ocean. I think it represents the freedom that nature can provide. Women viewers will especially love seeing Christopher Atkins naked in various scene. Brooke Shields however was only 14 years old at the time so a lovely body double Kathy Troutt acted in the nude scenes instead. Nevertheless Kathy is a beautiful body double and I loved every moment of her nude scenes.And finally if you love sea life then you will love this film. There are many beautiful underwater camera shots that show lots of sea creatures even an octopus!.The only bad thing about the movie is that there are some scenes that are very slowmoving especially the scenes showing wildlife by itself without the actors. But if you love nature then that won't bother you. Also there is a slight plot hole in the scene after Emmeline gives birth to the child since nothing is said about how the baby's umbilical cord was cut off.To sum it all up this is such a sweet movie. Christopher Atkins  Brooke Shields played their parts well and the filming location is beautiful. The nude scenes were very naturallooking and gave me a feeling of peace in my mind. Don't be fooled by the low rating see the movie and you might like it.I give this film 810".

	schema:reviewBody "What a beautiful heart stirring film. It stands to quench a thirst in all of us a fantasy our physce prays for. Such raw love real love virginity. Most people lack this gift and amazing power to create such pure love. We just don't realize that sex is more then pleasure... it's intertwined with love. In this movie two innocent young people have the chance to experience love in its purest sense. They literally don't know any one else to distract them from one anotherto distort their loves focus. They place all their love solely on the one person they ever knew and ever loved. Living together working together playing together crying together laughing together for as long as they can remember. Whether Richard and Em would have been attracted to each other in the real world makes no difference. Here their souls were tied together. Here all alone on this tropical island they really experienced life.Em's decision not to light the warning flare was disgusting horrifying and completely selfish. She knew quite well how much Richard was dying to return to San Ferisco. I mean just look at the evil guilty look pinned to her face as she decides to sit idly on the steps of her hut watching the ship go by. Can you blame her though? not really. She was so happy thereso peaceful. Although she never experienced the real world she sensed that her serene happy paradise life would be completely dissolved and crushed if they were to return to civilization. As angry as Richard was she knew it was the best thing for him to. Indeed the love they created and the short pure happy lives they soon led is breath taking. I'm thrilled that the film ended where it did because quite frankly I had no interest in seeing their pure beautiful life shattered as they would soon be forced to partake in the crazy hectic world we all exist in. Interestingly enough They do have a glimpse of some of the world's pain and insanity. Richard watches as a helpless man is killed and his confusion is not much different then ours as we ponder the many wars genocides and killings occurring now or in our past. I was forced to watch parts of this film over and over again and must part with it. I must face the fact that even in a dozen lifetimes my life will never come close to the pure love romance happiness and serenity that these two individuals partook of. This truly makes me depressed and I sort of wish I had never seen the film. On a happier note I can still try and emulate the concept of pure love displayed in the film. To discover an individual whom I could love and focus on as if we were both stranded on an island and pay no attention to the fact that there are other attractive people out there constantly tempting me. Because the two of us are alone and we love each other and our love will only grow as we partake in life's many circumstances. This also makes you think... could there love ever have faltered? I mean many people in love after a bunch of years discover that they aren't attracted to their mate anymore. They lose interest and move onsometimes successfully but lets be real.. usually not. They only find the same cycle occurring again and again. I firmly believe on the same note discussed above that Richard and Em's love would have been complete and unfaltering. With no other options with not other obstacles they would not be blinded as so many of us are into thinking there's always someone better. Richard and Em would have grown old together happy and content with their love never faltering.  that is if one of them didn't die of disease.... well lets be realistic this is just a movie and being out there in the wild with out any form of medication and knowledge in that field can easily pave the way to disease and death. Hey perhaps it could happen but I'm surprised one of them didn't come down with some life threatening fever or cold before there adolescence and died well movies are movies again I must part with this beautiful film and try and take those happy feelings inside and utilize them in privative way. sigh it will take me a while get over this fascinating film.".

You know what I'm talking aboutthe movies that are short on plot acting or both which are bolstered up by loud FX and revolutionary digital animation so that it becomes special effects in search of a picture.  I'm delighted to say that CALENDAR GIRLS has nothing of the kind.  It's all about the plot all about the women involved and all about laughing so hard you cryor maybe about being able to forget tears in deep laughter if only for a moment.The acting is superb.  One hardly needs to mention Helen Mirren.  I read one comment that pans her Yorkshire accent well I attended it with an Englishwoman who is very familiar with such an accent and she specifically told me that her accent never slipped so I've no idea where that comment came from.Having been involved with the world of cancer treatment recently fortunately with a happier outcome for my mother a survivor of breast cancer this movie strikes close to home.  It's completely accurate it's not pretty and it's often degrading no matter how much the oncological staff tries to make it easier.  The movie is also accurate in the kind of sentiments it expresses about cancer.  People who have been touched by that filthy disease will do ANYTHING to fight it.  I sat on a spin bike for twentyfour consecutive hours in aid of breast cancer less than two weeks ago so I do know what I'm talking about.  Yes a few liberties with the real story have been taken.  So what?  The result is a coherent progression that is more interested in human beings than plot details.  And isn't that what it should be about?I've heard this dismissed as a movie for older people.  I'm proud to be of that numberafter all at the age of thirtyfive I'm ten years out of the target demographic at which Hollywood films are aimed.  If by older people they mean people who want a movie to be about something important as opposed to the latest spectacular light show I'm glad to be of that number.  I'd recommend this to anyone who's interested in a movie that is both hysterically funny and deeply touching.  It has reinspired me in the battle against cancer and if it does that to anyone else it will have made a worthwhile difference.".

	schema:reviewBody "Did you know what makes the difference between Art and Pornography? Well its the artist. This was one of the stroking scenes of the film Calendar Girls. This film is profundly moving and even more because it is based on a true story. The women of the W.I club somewhere in Yorkshire are famous for plum jam and speeches on different household or gardening items which are mostly quite tedious. The situation changes by the time the husband of Annie Julie Walterssuffers from leukemia and cant get through. Annies best friend Chris Helen Mirrencomes up with the idea of a nude calendar with the women of the W.I. club to raise money for a settee at the leukemia ward at the local hospital. At first everybody is quite suspicious but the calendar turns out as a tremendous success which brings the girls even to Hollywood.I have rarely ever seen such a heartwarming and inspiring film. This movie makes you laugh and cry almost at the same time. My favourite scene was the one with the oreganojoint . As most British comedies the actors were fabulous and the jokes did not seem constructed like they do in most Hollywood productions.This film is a hymn for all middle aged women. It shows the world that 40 women can look great even when they are nude. The women of Yorkshire are like the flowers of Yorkshire in the last state of their lives they look best.This film is highly recommendable for everybody even if you just want to see the beautiful landscape of Yorkshire.".

This film is profundly moving and even more because it is based on a true story. The women of the W.I club somewhere in Yorkshire are famous for plum jam and speeches on different household or gardening items which are mostly quite tedious. The situation changes by the time the husband of Annie Julie Walterssuffers from leukemia and cant get through. Annies best friend Chris Helen Mirrencomes up with the idea of a nude calendar with the women of the W.I. club to raise money for a settee at the leukemia ward at the local hospital. At first everybody is quite suspicious but the calendar turns out as a tremendous success which brings the girls even to Hollywood.I have rarely ever seen such a heartwarming and inspiring film. This movie makes you laugh and cry almost at the same time. My favourite scene was the one with the oreganojoint .

Each of the girls' is given her own unique personality so that we see them not just as a group united in this inspiring endeavor but as individuals working through their own personal demons on the rode to the project's completion.  The women face the expected roadblocks and snafus in the form of shocked' disapproving voices in the community but their belief in the rightness of their cause brushes all such problems aside. This charming film provides more genuine outandout laughs than almost any comedy of recent times.  Calendar Girls' is heartwarming touching and inspiring  and what more could one ask from a feelgood' film than that?".

And some story lines are brought up one of the women has a cheating husband and are never resolved. Still there were some good laughs in it and there is some just beautiful views of I'm assuming Yorkshire. Especially incredible is a view of the entire town from on top of a huge rock overlooking the area.Also we have some wonderful British actresses playing in the lead roles. The two best were Helen Mirren who's just greatagain and Julie Walters who looks absolutely stunning. Also this is one of the few films that celebrates the sexuality of women who are 50. How many movies do you you see like that nowadays? Of course this is a British filmHollywood would NEVER tell a story like this. Also the film does have some fairly explicit glimpses of female nuditybut they're not sexual in context and ARE needed for the integrity of the story.I'm giving this a 7.".

When Annie's husband John dies of leukaemia Annie's friend Chris comes up with the bright idea of a fundraising calendar to replace the lumpy sofa in the relatives' room at the local hospital. The calendar will feature WI ladies taking part in WI activities but with the added unusual element of them being tastefully and discreetly nude.Based on a true story this film is great. The script is very funny the story is always interesting especially after the calendar is published when some elements of the story get a little darker and the Yorkshire scenery is beautiful.The allstar cast is a twoedged sword. On the one hand it is quite distracting when every one of these everyday Yorkshire housewives and their husbands is portrayed by a famous face. On the other hand the main performances Helen Mirren Julie Walters Penelope Wilton Celia Imrie are all superb.But the movie is a treat especially if you can look at the WI with a knowing fondness.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Women's Institute is I think peculiarly English  a nationwide club of predominantly middleaged women undertaking shared activities largely domestic in nature to alleviate the boredom of housewifery I may sound derogatory in my generalisation I do not mean to be. When Annie's husband John dies of leukaemia Annie's friend Chris comes up with the bright idea of a fundraising calendar to replace the lumpy sofa in the relatives' room at the local hospital. The calendar will feature WI ladies taking part in WI activities but with the added unusual element of them being tastefully and discreetly nude.Based on a true story this film is great. The script is very funny the story is always interesting especially after the calendar is published when some elements of the story get a little darker and the Yorkshire scenery is beautiful.The allstar cast is a twoedged sword. On the one hand it is quite distracting when every one of these everyday Yorkshire housewives and their husbands is portrayed by a famous face. On the other hand the main performances Helen Mirren Julie Walters Penelope Wilton Celia Imrie are all superb.But the movie is a treat especially if you can look at the WI with a knowing fondness.";

	schema:headline " Too many stretch marks...in the script";
	schema:reviewBody "At the end of the 1990s members of the U.K.'s Women's Institute got an idea for helping people with cancer and their families with a calendar featuring themselves in the nude. This was not unprecedented sports teams and others have been known to run similar fundraisers but the twist here was that the WI women were all over 50 years of age. It's a funny enough idea worth thinking about for a moment or two before the phone rings or whatever but doesn't seem like much of a basis for a movie. And now here's the proof.The makers of Calendar Girls offer another dip in the bottomless Britcom well of small comedies filled with wry chuckles and tender glances designed to make the viewer feel somehow better about themselves without really getting at the heart of anything. Aren't the British supposed to be our creative superiors? Shakespeare and all that? Many of these movies give me the feeling they're cribbing off old MASH episodes the nasty laterseasons stuff where Hawkeye turned to the camera at the end and asks us what we learned in class today. These icky selfassertion dramadies work like Terms Of Endearment only with Peter Rabbit scenery.Calendar Girls comes off as more crass and manipulative than most and I found myself resenting the way it delivered its jokes and dramatic moments alike with obvious setups and trilly speechifying. The script sometimes manages to develop real tension only to let it fade away. There's one subplot about one of the Calendar Girls' sons getting in trouble with the law and another about a philandering husband who cruelly sends his wife on a guilt trip which are resolved via unsatisfying oneliners and much lingering uncertainty. Helen Mirren's Chris doesn't seem to deal with situations so much as wisecrack her way through them which might be more interesting if the filmmakers didn't simply ape her approach.The opening section has charm and works more than it doesn't. That's when we are introduced to the concept behind the calendar the dying husband of Annie Julie Walters a gardener who writes a speech delivered by Chris where he compares the sunflower to the women of Yorkshire beautiful in every stage of growth but most glorious at the end. Chris Annie and several members of the fusty Women's Institute take his words to heart and to buy a sofa for a cancer ward's family room decide to put together a camera with nude photos of themselves representing each month of the year.The nudity is tasteful not really allhangout but kind of provocative in a way that does credit to the eternal sexiness of a strong woman whatever her age or her state of body. The scenes are funny and roll with a certain brave assertiveness that makes one want to join in the laughter even as one hears the unoiled wheels of audience manipulation grinding around you. For the first third of the movie it works more than it doesn't.Right after the calendar pictures are shot though Calendar Girls runs out of steam. So it makes due with a series of contrivances that build on a persistent formula which operates as follows The women get their hopes up. A crisis. Disaster! No wait it's not a disaster at all. Actually it's something good. It's better than good it's great! Note This is not a spoiler but it sort of is as you will find out from watching. This very thing keeps happening over and over again.Just when things can't get any worse they do. The Girls go Hollywood literally. Thematically of course the film has been there for quite some time. Now instead of crises about getting past the fustier Women's Institute members or finding a bigger pair of buns we have long scenes devoted to the plushness of their travel accommodations or meeting friendly neighborhood punk bands by the pool. Chris and Annie bicker over what this is all about to give us some conflict but not for long. No one worries what the WI makes of having their name dragged around in connection with this fleshy display since it's all about curing cancer. Cancer seems to serve the same purpose in this film as Vietnam POWs did in Rambo as sort of an excuse to justify the movie's every excess or each character's ambition. You don't like Calendar Girls? That must mean you like poor John bald and taking his nourishment through a straw!I see Calendar Girls as a take on two other better films. Everyone mentions The Full Monty and correctly but the film I kept flashing on was Waking Ned Devine. Two old timers in the country happen upon a scheme to make some money one more brassy than the other eventually uniting their quaint pastoral community behind them. One of them even gets naked. Yes Devine is set in Ireland but the same rustic whimsical dynamic applies. The fact both these earlier movies made some money not to mention the original Calendar Girls themselves seem more at the heart of what's going on here than solving the problem of cancer or standing up for the beauty of menopausal women.By the end I was waiting for someone to present Annie and Chris with a readymade cure for leukemia. I guess they couldn't afford a George Clooney walkon.".

Casting like this makes you wonder why other films seem to pick absolute blocks of wood for their side cast sometimes. My nitpicks with this particular movie are mostly to do with the fact that the movie not only doesn't tie up some loose plot threads it doesn't even look like it WANTS to.

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen this film three times each time pretending to those who invited me that I hadn't seen it before! I feel I know it pretty well and although a great real life story as a film it is pretty runofthemill. It was certainly a break from the typical Hollywood blockbusters which are released each summer at least the first time round and it fits into that laid back style of comedydrama which British screenwriters seem to have mastered pretty well. However the script was nothing very original and the jokes were generally quite predictable so that by the third viewing it was starting to feel like an episode of Last of the Summer Wine a VERY long running British sitcom for anyone outside the UK.

I feel I know it pretty well and although a great real life story as a film it is pretty runofthemill. It was certainly a break from the typical Hollywood blockbusters which are released each summer at least the first time round and it fits into that laid back style of comedydrama which British screenwriters seem to have mastered pretty well. However the script was nothing very original and the jokes were generally quite predictable so that by the third viewing it was starting to feel like an episode of Last of the Summer Wine a VERY long running British sitcom for anyone outside the UK.

But it turned out to be in the main a crushing disappointment. The main problem is the screenplay. It's not funny. There are a few great comic moments and gems that give you an insight into what the film could have been but the end result suffers dreadfully by not having the original choice of screenwriter  Victoria Wood. It panders too much to Hollywood tastes and lacks the sparkle and eloquent wit of Wood's comedy. Why oh why didn't they allow her to write the screenpay? Another issue I have is casting. Helen Mirren is a great actress but here she is woefully miscast  unfunny out of place and far too overthetop  cold even. Plus her Yorkshire accent and I should know being a native! is all over the place. Julie Walters and Celia Imrie are the real heart and soul of this film  warm and downtoearth  but for some bizarre reason they especially Celia are given little to do and not stretched. This is a shame. The main strength of this film however is its representation of women and it's emphasis upon female friendship. I applaud the 'calendar shooting' scenes because AT LAST here we have a plethora of real women with wrinkles cellulite and no retouching. Great. They all look fab. That I love. But what really is such a shame is the lack of humour the terrible ending the meandering final few scenes in Hollywood are so badly written and have absolutely no point and the pandering to American audiences. What we have here is a kind of painting by numbers 'how to make a heart warming Yorkshire comedy' which does work in some instances but is overall a real disappoinment.

And this small and elegant English village lady cannot but save herself by a notsoelegant trade through the help of her own gardener and her late husband's unseen mistress in London.I especially like the daredevil scene when Grace is fully dressed up touting her masterpiece cannabis cultured in her own green house to the undesirable figures in sleazy areas in London. Her act is comical prudent and daring at the same time. I find it hard to imagine a welldressed and French speaking Chinese grandma would approach me touting homemade grass so reeklessly in Wanchai or Mongkok.English humour or European subtlety can never be reproduced by Hollywood the air the smell everything belongs to the Brits and Europeans.

	schema:reviewBody "Charming doesn't even begin to describe Saving Grace it's absolutely irresistible! Anyone who ventures into this movie will leave with their spirits soaring high haha.Grace Trevethyn Brenda Blethyn has just lost her husband but her problems are about to get a whole lot worse. Her dearly departed has left her with no money and outstanding debts. Faced with losing everything she has to find out a way to get a lot of cash...fast! She gets an idea when her gardener Matthew Craig Ferguson asks the townfamous horticulturist to give him advice on a plant he is secretly growing. Grace immediately realizes that his plant is marijuana so they decide to use her gardening skills to grow a lot of topquality weed and then sell it to pay off her outstanding debts.The most notable quality about Saving Grace is its likability. Every character is extremely sympathetic and save for the first 20 or so minutes the film is nonstop good cheer. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone even if it means turning a blind eye to some rather illegal activities.The acting is topnotch. Brenda Blethyn is one of Britain's finest actresses and here is why. She turns what could have been a caricature into a fully living and breathing individual. She's a nice lady but she's not stupid. Craig Ferguson is equally amiable as Matthew. He's a deadbeat loser but he's so likable that it doesn't matter. The rest of the ensemble cast fits in this category as well but special mention has to go to Tcheky Karyo. The French actor always has a aura of menace about him and that suits him well but he also has great comedy skills.Nigel Cole finds the perfect tone for Saving Grace. It's all about the charm. One of the problems I have with British humor is that all the energy seems to be drained out of the film. Not so here. The film is thoroughly likable and always amusing. That's not to say that Saving Grace is just a likable movie that will leave you with a grin and a good feeling. While this movie is not an out and out comedy it does boast two or three scenes that are nothing short of hysterical.If there's any problem with the film it's that the climax is a little confusing. The questions are answered though and the ending boasts an unexpected twist.See Saving Grace especially when you're having a bad day.".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess that when you ask someone to name a British movie that deals with drugs they will almost immediately say Trainspotting. Well if there is one movie you can't compare Saving Grace to than it must be that one. These movies have only two things in common and that is the fact that they talk about drugs and that they are English but any further comparison is useless and impossible.Saving Grace is a movie about a wealthy smalltown English widow who discovers that she isn't as rich as she has always believed. Her husband has committed suicide leaving her in debt for 300.000 British pounds thanks to his failed business ventures. Facing the loss of all her belongings and her home she turns to the only thing she's got left her skill as a greenhouse gardener. In the meantime her gardener has a few problems of his own. To make some money he tries to make a few marijuana plants grow in a hidden location but isn't very successful at it. But then he comes up with a brilliant idea that will help the both of them. They will grow the plants with the help of her gardening skills and her greenhouse believing that noone in the village knows what they are doing...This movie may not be the best one about drugs that you've ever seen and I'm convinced that Hollywood wouldn't even dare to make a movie about this subject but the makers certainly proved that it is possible to make a nice movie with it that is more than just worth a watch. This is a very witty and perhaps also a very typical English movie. The story is nice although the ending is a bit corny it's charming and has some good English humor to offer next to some nice acting and directing. This is a very nice movie which I give a 7.510.".

The relationship and rapport between Grace and Matthew is wellportrayed and Brenda Blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character  you can really feel what she is going through.The casting of the minor roles is excellent even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric.  However the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Grace's romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all.  And surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing?  Sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants.".

It's the first time I've seen his work and I can see why he's so popular.But there's plenty more to take note of. Watching Faguendes' family ties nearly unravel is almost heartbreaking at times. To see three generations is almost unheard of in today's movies. I was pleased to see it.The other subplots are equally fun. The soontobe exported Brazilian soccer player's quest to learn how to curse in English is hilarious. And watching the girl dream of her online boyfriend is something many of us can relate to. Not to mention the soulful longing of the young man Pedro Paul's sonwho wants her but isn't brave enough to state his case.All this plays out against an almost idyllic backdrop of sand dunes towering mountains charming cafes and crashing surf.

But there's just something about it I couldn't let go ofmaybe it was the beautiful Rio de Janeiro backdrop that this film is set against. Maybe it's the opportunity to see Amy Irving once again in all her glory. I don't know which but the lady should definitely be in more movies especially in ones where her husband directs her and therefore gives her the best role and makes her the most sympathetic in the film. Irving stars as Mary Ann Simpson an English teacher in Rio who teaches classes by night and private students by day. Across the hall from her classes is the shop of an elderly tailor whose lawyer son Pedro Paulo Antnio Fagundes is helping his father get out of an alimony fix that involves a much younger wife. One night Pedro Paulo runs into our heroine on the elevator and love at first sight is born. Right away he forgets about Tania the exwife Dbora Bloch he was having trouble letting go of and goes after this mysterious new woman in his life. Along the sidelines there are plots that involve Irving's student Nadine Drica Moraes and her online romance with a SoHo artist Gary' and another regarding the lawyer's intern Sharon Giovana Antonelli and her romance with both her boss' brother Roberto and the famous soccer player Acacio Alexandre Borges who also happens to be taking private English lessons from Mary Ann. All these lines cross and meet and even out in perfect form and yet somehow at its most typical the film manages to be at its most enjoyable possibly because Barreto has such a good time entertaining his audience that one can't help but dive right in.

	schema:reviewBody "Bossa Nova has lots of great shots of Rio de Janerio and lots of pretty actors and a soundtrack that combines old and new bossa nova tunes. Unfortunately that's about all it has going for it.The film is about the romance between an American woman who teaches English to the wealthy and her corporate lawyer student who bears a striking resemblance to Marcello Mastroianni.  Both of them are supposed to be in their early to midforties.The age aspect is one problem I have with this film.  I'm not against middleage romance on film but it's just so obvious that Antonio Fagundes is closer to fifty.Another problem I have is with Amy Irving's acting skills.  At times it's obvious she's reading straight off a cue card.  Good actors never let us see them working.But the biggest complaint I have about this film is the plot or rather the lack thereof.  The film is filled with lots of confusing little subplots some of which never resolve themselves.  This I guess is to distract the audience from the fact that the main plot is so threadbare.Many American critics have praised this film.  This is largely I believe because it is not an American film and was not bankrolled by a major Hollywood studio.  However I always use the same barometer to judge a film regardless of its origin or pedigree.  I give this film the same criticism I would give to a film such as How Stella Got Her Groove Back or The Horse Whisperer  It's beautiful to look at but once you get past the scenery and the actors' looks there's not much left.  I give this film a 6 out of 10.".

If you like Bossa Nova music you won't be disappointed. One of my favorite albums of all time is Getz Gilberto. This movie satisfies the ears with Girl from Ipanema and Corcovado both found on the GetzGilberto album. Other Bossa Nova favorites in this movie are Wave and One Note Samba. If you like the Portuguese language again you won't be disappointed. I was very curious about Amy Irving and her ability to speak this foreign language. Was she dubbed or did she learn it? She sounded authentic. Bossa Nova is also a feast for the eyes. Much like Enchanted April is a virtual trip to Italy this movie takes you to Brazil. If you have been waiting to go to Rio but won't be going any time soon this is your chance to get a virtual Rio experience. This movie was for me about the atmosphere of the place not the typical movie experience. Bossa Nova is definitely worth seeing from your couch or comfy chair!".

The confluence of a myriad of characters of diverse backgrounds including Alexandre Borges the star of the epic Um Copo de Clera as a soccer star about to be traded to an English League team comes together in a fashion not unlike Altman's Nashville with some winners and some losers including nice guys. No as mentioned earlier this does not show you a gritty realistic Rio but after the fantasy Broadway song and dance sequence who the hell would have expected it?

The script is witty realistic to the Brazil I know the characters are funny and full of idiosyncracies. I loved the Brazilian law clerk all casual and being herself.

There are no perfect characters here despite Amy Irvings' casting as a widowed ESL teacher living in Aproador directly above Ipanema who opens up the possibility of love after two years mourning the death of her Braziian husband. The human and longing side of our existence has our characters taking chances outside of their comfort zones and trying to make it work despite the obvious. This is where the comedy really works as well as the drama. Almost every character has a love story and to detail it would spoil their reactions to the scenario they've put them selves in. Fun performances by all set to popular Bossa Nova reworked by Deodado.. I was shocked by the credits! . I can attest that Rio looks just like the picture postcard as in this 2000 movie as it does the many others venturing into the socioeconomicpolitical aspect of life there that has been so well documented and filmed for a world wide audience. This movie has a limited audience due to that be get out a little have some fun you're not too old.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bossa Nova 2000 Dir Bruno Barreto  Cast Antonio Fagundes Amy Irving Alexandre Borges Drica Moraes Debora Bloch Brazilian comedy about the nature of romance. Amy Irving stars as an English teacher who has a friend in an Internet relationship. An attorney takes her English class in hopes of meeting her. His wife dumped him for a tai chi instructor. Director Bruno Barreto populates the film with interesting characters. He previously made One Tough Cop and Four Days in September. Irving is terrific as a widow confused about her emotions yet takes a chance on a new relationship. Antonio Fagundes is hilarious as he tests the depths of love but one may question whether the attorney made the honourable choice. Hilarious supporting work by Alexandre Borges as a soccer player who steals every scene he is in and Drica Moraes who indulges in Internet dating perhaps because it presents a mystery. Director Barreto succeeds in presenting these characters realistic yet with effective comic twerks that pay off. The conclusion makes the romantic elements somewhat questionable but this film thrives more on humour and the cast pull through big time on dialogue and funny situations. It presents romance within culture and our methods of pursuit whether effective or not. Theme of influence is evident but boarders on sex which is flimsy yet entertaining here. Score 8  10".

It's a good surprise seeing Bruno Barreto who directed many erotic movies did a very nice piece without any nudity even with lots of babes in the cast. The story is about the romantic involvement between Pedro Antnio Fagundes our senior superstar and Mary Ann Amy Irving and lots of funny things that happen around them. I could say I don't like Irving's performance because she looked very bored all the time. She was there only because she was Mr. Barreto's wife. On the other hand all Brazilians were terrific with lots of good acting from Alexandre Borges Romario's alterego Drica Moraes Mary Ann's friend who dated with an American through email Giovanna Antonelli Pedro Cardoso Dbora Bloch and so many others that shine even in small roles. I particularly like Alberto De Mendoza the tailor Pedro's father Spanishspeaker  helping his son on impressing the English teacher in a very unusual way  watch it and check it out. If the movie's plot was not so original I tell it doesn't matter. As in Centralstation the most important is how the story is told the cast quality music score and so many other things that make the real difference. I really recommend this movie for people from all nations since the comedy shown there is universal.".

A great number of light weighted bossa nova themes drop in throughout the movie just like a CD track after another even surpassing the number of those who have been gathered for the soundtrack CD. Listen to the sea tides sounds. There's practically no moment in the picture that you don't hear them.  Watch the wind moving trees bushes  and also penetrating the rooms turned into soft breezes. Watch the bright sun light surrounding offices and appartments all of them sharing the same beautiful sea view.What the female characters and you'll notice that all of them aren't a romantic cliche by themselves. But they do aspire to cliche livestyles and that forces you to look into their personas just to discover how adorable they surprisingly come up to be.I would've liked to have seen this movie with a Frozen Lemonade and a pair of sunglasses. The experience is the same. If you are generous to take into account a cute and easy going story with some contemporary moral common places give this movie a chance and maybe you'll be among those of us who think that no matter its lightness this picture deserves a place between cult movies.".

No.  The people who made Bossa Nova very selfconsciously steered away from the grit to concentrate on the romantic state of mind of the characters surrounding them with gorgeous locales and a dazzling soundtrack filled with Brazilian classics which is exactly right for the story.  Amy Irving is absolutely enchanting as the protagonist showing the kind of irresistible innocent charm she exercised in Crossing Delancey and Yentl.  Granted the film gets a bit silly at times but if you're willing to suspend your disbelief and go with the flow buy the coincidences and accept the magic the final result is a decidedly seductive romantic comedy the kind they rarely make anymore.  I'm a guy and I loved this movie and I'll bet money there isn't a woman out there who won't like it at least as much as I did.  Personally I saw this on a studioreleased tape before it opened in theaters and will pay to see it again on the big screen to take in the gorgeous widescreen cinematography and the fabulous music as they were meant to be experienced.".
