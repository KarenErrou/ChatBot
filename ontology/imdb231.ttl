	schema:reviewBody "MANON may well be Clouzot's misanthropic riposte to the terrible injustice he suffered in postwar France when he was accused of making a collaborationist film LE CORBEAU and subsequently barred from working in the French film industry for five years as punishment. LE CORBEAU is in fact the only film that I know of made during the Ptain era that presented any sort of subversive threat to that collaborationist regime one which let it not be forgotten was officially recognised by the USA the Soviet Union and The Vatican.It is as if Clouzot wanted to show both the depths to which humans will sometimes sink in order to pursue their own personal wellbeing collaborating with evil as well as the greater moral outrage of war and its aftermath which never somehow seems to eclipse or exceed society's trivial and selfrighteous moral preoccupation with human sexuality. It is a film about survival in a society which has become brutalised and desensitised by war where racketeers gangsters and prostitutes resort to any means or method as they ruthlessly take the measure of the hypocrisy of the dominant ideology and act in kind. Totally apolitical feckless and bereft of any human sympathy for anyone but themselves they become a bleak and grotesque underclass that has taken the rules of the game to its logical hideous and heartless conclusion.Manon the central character is not so much slut turned prostitute as prostitute turned slut. Dehumanised by the experience of the war and the cruel retribution that subsequently scapegoated women whose only crime of collaboration was to have sex with German soldiers whom their own government had described as guests and which are now rewritten into history as occupiers she sees sex as a means to an end her only available weapon in her own personal war  of survival in a cruel and cynical world.But although to all intents and purposes she has long since convinced herself that she has consciously extinguished any kind or compassionate part of her nature or human fellowfeeling she might once have had it returns with an ironic and cruel vengeance when she meets someone whom she really loves. Like Lulu in PANDORA'S BOX the first and only time she shows a genuine actegratuite of human kindness her fate becomes sealed and this weakness becomes the very means and vehicle by which she will meet her downfall. As a heartless tart she can make it but as a vulnerable loving human she is doomed.When she and her lover flee as illegal immigrants to try and find happiness in Palestine she is shot in the desert by marauding Arabs and dies in the arms of her lover one of cinema's most powerful and memorable scenes in which he buries her corpse in the sand but cannot bring himself to finally cover her face.Originally banned in the UK but passed with cuts by the London Council even then they ordered no less than 10 cuts in the film's trailer!! it has as a result become a forgotten and lost film and if remembered at all as is so often the case in these matters it is for the controversy it caused when it was new despite the fact that it was awarded The Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. A gesture which I suspect also reflected the jury's contempt for the postwar injustice meted out to Clouzot over LE CORBEAU.Clouzot was one of the world's most gifted directors and all his films merit not just one but several viewings and MANON is one of his very best.".

To which my older brother said What body? She doesn't have one! Hmm! My poor brother what does he know? Anyway I didn't see MANON in 1949 but 56 years later thanks to eBay I caught up on this classic and without disappointment. This film has the authentic feel of classics like Italy's Bicycle Thief and Paisan  having the ravages of World War II right there and everywhere you look in 1949 neither wartorn Europe nor attitudes needed to be recreated. The story is involving from the first moments and never lets up. Manon and her soulmate Robert meet when he helps save her from the collaboratorheadshave she's sentenced to endure as punishment for her attentions to German soldiers. They will remain together throughout her numerous and shameless infidelities each of which serves both of them and never with any loss of love for Robert. Cecile Aubry's femmeinnocent was a rare thing to see in 1949. Truly experienced men know that getting and holding a young woman like Manon is a neverending challenge that no real man would ever quit. While traditional built like a brick youknowwhat sexpots wait in vain for the phone to ring the femmeinnocents are fighting men off like flies. This film will show the viewer many of the dark sides of the pre and post liberation era which history might like to have buried. I'll skip over most of the compelling story and just say that the final scenes when the couple arrive in Palestine along with the Jewish refugees  these are scenes that define classic movies.

His forte was telling a gritty story with characters stretched to the breaking point as Montand and Vanel were in Wages of Fear. It required a great deal of updating and tinkering with the basic story before Clouzot could feel comfortable with it.Cecile Aubry does not impress me with her acting skills she mainly pouts and sighs her way through the picture. How much more could Danielle Darrieux or Micheline Presle have brought to the film! Michel Auclair was a superb leading man who made many films this is one of his best see him also in Maigret et l'affaire SaintFiacre. Here he manages to convey desire murderous rage and exasperation with Manon's whims. Dora Doll and her big toothy grin as well as Gabrielle Dorziat as the prim madam of Manon's brothel were good but Serge Reggiani as Manon's brother stole every scene he was in.".

Take lots of people getting drunk jocks ostracizing nerds from there way of life the weak rising up to take back what is just as much a right as it is to others and of course lots of nudity featuring an abundance of gorgeous women. What you have here is a great recipe for success.What made Revenge work is that it didn't try to pretend to be something that it wasn't. This was an exploitive sexfest and it worked well. What it also had was a funny script and one that we could all relate to. I mean who hasn't felt left out or relegated to the side lines while someone else gets all the glory? Besides being extremely funny this film touched on something that we all can relate to.Revenge of the Nerds is another of the teen films that was hilarious and it ended up spawning a slew of sequels. Avoid them and see this one again. It's worth it especially if you were a teen when it came out. And if you are a teen now this is a treat to watch. This is one of the films that writers study when they are thinking what they can put into their film to make it crude rude and raunchy. This should be a must see!9 out of 10".

The film does not really go anywhere much at all the jokes work only about half the time and it is all a bit short on its content but despite all of this the film has a pleasant and rather enjoyable nature not common to the average college comedy and this makes it a rather uniquely likable film overall.

When they are bullied continually they decide to take matters into their own hands and fight back with the Jock's own games.If there's one genre in the world that I hate it's the American college jocknerd comedy.  Whether it be the Animal House or Porky's or more modern ones  I hate almost all of them!  So when I watched this I watched it with a certain fear.  However the plot makes redresses the balance by having us support the nerds!  It's well plotted so that it isn't just them becoming just like the jocks but instead learning their own lessons.  Of course it is rude at times and does fall into being just silly and slapstick but it's mixed nicely with some good sentiment and more gentle laugh.The cast is great in retrospect.  Anthony Edwards is a real surprise in this postER time.  Likewise Busfield is strange after 30something and West Wing.  Less so but Moonlighting's Curtis Armstrong is funny to see.  And lets not forget James Cromwell or Jamie as he was called then! John Goodman and black 1970's star Bernie Casey!  The nerds are all good  rising above their caricatures to start to bring out characters.Overall this is a spin on the fratcomedy so it is a little juvenile and silly but the fact that it is spun towards the nerds makes it that little bit refreshing to watch compared to so many where our heroes' are arrogant annoying jocktypes who sponge off mummy and daddy just to get drunk at college.  Not a great movie but much better than anything else postAnimal House  I'm with the nerds!".

The nerds who join togetherform their fraternity Lambda Lambda Lambda fight back against the Alpha Betas the jock fraternity and come out on top.

Jefferson Julia Montgomery Up The Creeka s Betty Childs Michelle Meyrink Real Genius and The Outsiders as Judy they all give great performances in the film. John Goodman of Roseanne plays the mean Coach Harris he is awesome in the movie too. James Cromwell Babe Star Trek First Contact and L.A. Confidential as Mr. Skolnick Lewis's nerdy father is funny.The nerds fought for themselves and won the Nerd Revolution against the beautiful people they gained control of The Greek Council.

In fact any male who isn't a jock or a WASP isn't even allowed to live in the dorms. A group of misfits including the two main characters Lewis and Gilbert are forced to live in the gym. They do find accommodations but they continue to suffer humiliation and embarrassment from the Alpha Betas. And so like in the title of the movie they get REVENGE.This is a movie that certainly can't be made today. Affirmative Action certainly would be in place to disallow discrimination on college campuses. The villains make fun of anyone who isn't like them. Still when it's all said and done the film sends out a message that you should be proud of yourself and how you look and not let anybody tell you otherwise.Yes as an 80's film you'll see every requisite of the decade but you'll also see something that's a portent of the future. The Nerds raid the women's dorm so they can cause a distraction so others can install cameras in the bedrooms and showers so they can be spied on. That has become very popular on the 'Net.As for the cast Oh my! You'll never see this intriguing mix too often.

It was a time when sexual equality and respect for intellectual matters took a few giant steps back. It was before Columbine. It was a time when the jocks ruled.In all times ordinary comedy pokes fun at the prevailing values and after the fun ends with a simple moral. And so it is here. What makes this movie so remarkable are the two morals one serious one halfjoking.The first is that nerds are better at sex. Despite its titillating wrapper it presents a profound insight into American society even today  though the stereotype of nerd' has drifted quite a bit. The second is that most people in society are not in the privileged celebrated  class at least not in ways that they value.High school comedies fascinate me. That's because high schoolers are faced with a very small selection of personality types among which they must choose. Those who fight the choice actually constitute one of these types. I believe the number to be constant at seven but that's my own theory. By setting a comedy or drama in high school something all of us have been through you get huge shortcuts in setting up the world of your story. The seven types are immediately recognized and you can get on to your parody or whatever you intend. This film is notable in addressing the nature of the world itself.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 4 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't understand why this movie is rated only a 6. It is far superior to most of the comedies from around the same time and a lot of comedies from recent years. It holds up today amazingly well. Most comedies from the 80's kind of lose their charm over the years. I saw this again recently with my wife she had never seen it and she loved it and I laughed just as much as I did before. It's not just a mindless college sex romp like Porky's. It had some intelligence and a lot of heart. It was also refreshingly politically incorrect and raunchy. There are some truly unforgettable characters like Booger and Lamar. The Asian guy was really funny too. Also the child prodigy. There were lots of funny quotable lines and tons of hilarious scenes like the party scene. The talent show performance was a moment in history. The end was truly touching. This movie is a classic. It's up there with Airplane Weird Science and There's Something About Mary. You don't have to be a nerd to love it! Anybody that didn't like this movie is NOT someone I'd want to associate with.".

	onyx:emotionText "I don't understand why this movie is rated only a 6. It is far superior to most of the comedies from around the same time and a lot of comedies from recent years. It holds up today amazingly well. Most comedies from the 80's kind of lose their charm over the years. I saw this again recently with my wife she had never seen it and she loved it and I laughed just as much as I did before. It's not just a mindless college sex romp like Porky's. It had some intelligence and a lot of heart. It was also refreshingly politically incorrect and raunchy. There are some truly unforgettable characters like Booger and Lamar. The Asian guy was really funny too. Also the child prodigy. There were lots of funny quotable lines and tons of hilarious scenes like the party scene. The talent show performance was a moment in history. The end was truly touching. This movie is a classic. It's up there with Airplane Weird Science and There's Something About Mary. You don't have to be a nerd to love it! Anybody that didn't like this movie is NOT someone I'd want to associate with.";

Revenge does take place as a civil war of students ensues and is fueled by grossout jokes sexual situations and all sorts of other crazed perversions. When all is said and done the film is a curious overachiever in the end. The main reason is the cast is so likeable. Donald Gibbs steals the show as one of the crazed football players and established actors like James Cromwell John Goodman and David Wohl also leave lasting impressions.

But the odd get even as the tagline states by forming their own fraternity and proving their power as a foureyed accordionloving chessplaying group.Of course Revenge of the Nerds wasn't meant to win any awards. It's supposed to be a crude comedy for older teens. The trouble is none of the crudeness works. The nerds place hidden cameras to watch the popular girls undress. They secretly distribute topless photos of a snotty cheerleader in the bottom of cream pie plates. They smoke pot and throw lame parties. None of it's particularly funny.This film doesn't even work on a level that other unfunny comedies sometimes can. A comedy can be entertaining without being hilarious. But Revenge of the Nerds tries to be little else other than a dumb comedy. At its conclusion it attempts to deliver a feelgood message about being yourself but by then it's impossible to take anything it has to say seriously.I really wanted to like this film. The trailer included on the DVD version made it look like a lot of fun. But when all is said and done the jocks and the cheerleaders aren't the only ones facing the wrath of these nerds.".

Sleeping on cots in the gym they find other likeminded misfits and decide to create their own fraternity.The film follows the 80's comedy blueprint a simple premise is stated then hijinks ensue. Here it is Nerds go to school and fight jocks then hijinks ensue.Battling Alpha Betas Stan Ted McGinley he who has caused many a TV show to Jump the Shark Burke Matt Salinger son of J.D. and star of 1990's Captain America and Ogre Donald Gibb Ray Jackson from Bloodsport our Nerds overcome adversity and become a probationary TriLamb fraternity. Ironically Lambda Lambda Lambda has always been an allblack frat. And the boys only have one black member the stereotypically gay Lamar.That means that TriLamb president U.N. Jefferson Bernie Casey from Gargoyles! has to come visit the boys. They throw a party that is boring until Booger's Curtis Armstrong drugs get involved  welcome to the 80's  and everyone loses their inhibitions. However the jocks disrupt their party leading to Jefferson coming around to the guys as he senses discrimination.The Nerds take their titular revenge by conducting a panty raid and putting liquid heat into the jock straps of the football team leading to Jefferson making them a real frat. However the harassment can never stop while Stan is the President of the Greek Council. So the Nerds need to win the Greek Games during homecoming so that they get a vote  which they do so via a combination of their intelligence more drugs and some questionable decisions more on those in a bit. Oh yeah  and there's also an 80's synth music number.The jocks trash the Nerds house but Gilbert decides to speak up at a pep rally. The dean U.N. Jefferson and a group of big black TriLambs stand up for him and the Nerds ask all the disenfranchised in the audience to join them. The dean tells the jocks that they have to give up their house until the damage to the TriLambs house is fixed saying You're jocks go live in the gym. Everyone celebrates. The end.Except well there are some troubling moments.What bonds the Nerds and brings them together? A panty raid as the boys descend on the Pi Delta Pi sorority house stealing panties chasing women and placing video cameras through which the boys watch the women while they go about their daily lives. In the 80's this was considered a prank. Today we'd call it rape. But it gets worse. Much worse.In the Greek Games a pieselling contest determines much of the final score. The Nerds win by using nude photos of Betty Julia Montgomery The Kindred under the crust of their pies. Again this is abhorrent behavior. But it gets worse.There's also a kissing booth where Lewis attempts to make his move on Betty. She is replaced with a large unattractive woman showing that even the Nerds place an emphasis on physical versus internal beauty no matter what hardships that very same prejudice has put them through. Then Lewis steals Stan's costume and tricks Betty into having sex with him. Yes the hero of this movie knowingly ignores consent to have sex. This is pure and simple rape. This isn't a snowflake looking back on a fun remnant of our pop culture past. This scene has bothered me since I first watching this film on VHS. Even worse Betty falls instantly in love with her rapist asking him if all Nerds are this good in bed.I haven't even gotten into the racism of the film which posits all Japanese as horny photograph taking morons through the Takashi character. That said Brian Tochi the actor who played Takashi is credited for breaking the barriers and opening doors for East Asian people in entertainment in the U.S. and advancing the perception that Oriental actors have the ability to portray more mainstream roles. Those mainstream roles also include Cadet Tomoko Elvis Nogata in the Police Academy films who acts just as ridiculous as Takashi but doesn't have his own corny Asian theme song. Or just how stereotypically gay Lamar is.But to me the worst sin of the film is that when the Nerds win instead of treating their opponents with the care that they never received and teaching everyone an important lesson they instead relegate the jocks back to the fate they had once suffered. No one learns anything. The cycle repeats and now the jocks become the Nerds who have become the jocks. This reminds me of how insular societies  wrestling fans comic book lovers  can be more hatefilled and clique obsessed than their worst perceived enemies.Read more at httpbit.ly2A4SBqO".

I was keen on watching it again though because it was one of those films in fact it was the first TA movie that I ever saw that I had watched numerous times when I was young. I guess I related to the main characters in these films being somewhat of an outcast though unlike these guys never having a friend or a group of friends that I could fall back on that is until I met the Dungeons and Dragons dorks at the State Library.It is interesting to look at some of the perspectives of this film in a way the suggestion that the nerds of this film tend to if they manage to survive high school and college end up being much more successful than the jocks in this film. There is a lot of subtle imagery in it though with the jocks being a part of a fraternity known as the AlphaBetas suggesting that they are the premier people on the campus.There are things that differ between my experience of university though because being an Australian campus life here is much different. Firstly we do not have fraternities or sororities. They simply do not exist. Secondly there is no faculty of sport in Australian universities so you will not actually encounter anybody like the AlphaBetas here.The other interesting thing about the characters in this film is that while it is reflective of campus life in the United States it also brings to mind how many of the AlphaBetas being the sporting heroes are unlikely to live out their days in luxury. Sporting heroes and others in the entertainment industry become millionaires however it is the nerds and the geeks who become billionaires. However the future is generally not at the forefront of people's mind when they are undergoing persecution. Granted Gilbert does speak of Nerd Persecution at the end of the film and I guess in a way it does exist however in this film they use their brains to fight back and they win. It is also interesting to note that the AlphaBetas use fear to rule the campus and it is only when that fear is broken by everybody coming to understand that anybody who is not an AlphaBeta is by definition a nerd that the power of the AlphaBetas is broken.However while this film may have some place in my heart it is still a TA movie and to be honest with you I really don't find it all that funny anyway.".

I like Revenge of the nerds  not only because in some way this movie is about me  but also because of the message it's sending to the world  don't be ashamed of who you are . The socalled beautiful people are pathetic losers with their hate for people who aren't exactly like them. Even the nerds will have their day in life . For all of the beautiful people out there  time has come for revenge of the nerds !The movie is full of colorful  memorable and likable characters  THE NERDS  Robert Carradine as the mild mannered Lewis Skonick  Anthony Edwards as brave Gilbert Lowell Curtis Armstrong as the disgusting Booger  Larry B. Scott as homosexual nerd Lamar Latrell Brian Tochi as funny Japanese nerd Toshiro Takashi  Timothy Busfield as nerd with the violin Arnold Poindexter  Andrew Casesse as small nerd in glasses Harold Wormser THE OTHERS  Ted McGinley as Alpha Beta leader Stan Gable Donald Gibb as Ogre John Goodman as Coach Harris and James Cromwell as Mr. Skolnick. I was especially surprised to see John Goodman in good shape . So  he wasn't fat all his life And yes  all those characters are onedimensional similiarly to the characters in Police Academy  .

The ending with the song We are the champions  is surprisingly touching. A heart warming ending. ROTF was so successful that Hollywood made 3 sequels the last two were basically TVmovies  . I don't recommend any of them  maybe with the exception of second one  which is kinda watchable.You don't have to be a nerd to appreciate it . Unlike most of teen comedies today it at least feels honest. I give it 210.".

I like Revenge of the nerds  not only because in some way this movie is about me  but also because of the message it's sending to the world  don't be ashamed of who you are . The socalled beautiful people are pathetic losers with their hate for people who aren't exactly like them. Even the nerds will have their day in life . For all of the beautiful people out there  time has come for revenge of the nerds !The movie is full of colorful  memorable and likable characters  THE NERDS  Robert Carradine as the mild mannered Lewis Skonick  Anthony Edwards as brave Gilbert Lowell Curtis Armstrong as the disgusting Booger  Larry B. Scott as homosexual nerd Lamar Latrell Brian Tochi as funny Japanese nerd Toshiro Takashi  Timothy Busfield as nerd with the violin Arnold Poindexter  Andrew Casesse as small nerd in glasses Harold Wormser THE OTHERS  Ted McGinley as Alpha Beta leader Stan Gable Donald Gibb as Ogre John Goodman as Coach Harris and James Cromwell as Mr. Skolnick. I was especially surprised to see John Goodman in good shape . So  he wasn't fat all his life And yes  all those characters are onedimensional similiarly to the characters in Police Academy  .

After watching it I was just unimpressed very unimpressed.First off the characters aren't very good. The nerds the jocks and even the girls and teachers are very annoying. They acted like the Mary Sues and Gary Stus you'd read in fanfiction. They're too annoying they're way too impossible to like or care about.Plus where are the other cliques like the punks since they were a clique in the 80's so why aren't they there too? Another problem I have with the film is the writing which is the script itself it's not so good. The dialogue is more annoying the acting didn't help although actors such as John Goodman tried to make the best out of it.And the jokes aren't very good they're just not funny. The thing is call me bias or anything but I felt that the film was trying to imitate Animal House but it failed so badly at doing that. If John Landis was somehow offered to direct the film and rejected it I can see why.The only good things about it were John Goodman and Bernie Casey they played their roles and made the best out of the script they were given.And the choice of music is pretty good the theme song is pretty catchy a bit annoying but catchy.I'm sorry to the Nerds fanbase but this film just isn't very good bash me and flame me all you like but it won't change my opinion.Overall 310 from me. I intend on reviewing the sequels and trust me what I'll say won't be pretty.".

	schema:reviewBody "Revenge of the Nerds  1984There have been a lot of comedic ripoffs of Animal House' over the past years. Police Academy' and all its sequels come to mind but those films were also ripoffs of Stripes' with Bill Murray. Basically all those movies are in the same genre misfits strike back and win the day. That's what it is. In Animal House' it was a pack of college slobs in Stripes' it was Bill Murray and his gang of oddballs in Police Academy' it was Steve Guttenberg with his ripoff pack. Now I'm reviewing Revenge of the Nerds' another comedy about nerds and how they conquer the cool' people. Thank God this one is funny and not another ripoff i.e. Police Academy.'As I write this I have never seen Animal House.' I know that to be a movie buff' Animal House' is a mustsee but I just haven't gotten around to seeing it yet not having it at my local video rental store and the television companies never putting it on TV doesn't help much either. So with that in mind Revenge of the Nerds' is to me the best collegegeeksmisfits comedy around   perhaps even better than Stripes' though that is pushing it a bit. After a bunch of nerds are shipped off to college they are utterly devastated by the fact that they are picked on constantly though I don't understand how that can be anything new for those guys. The jocks of the college ridicule them publicly causing them to retreat to their college dorms.But now they've had it up to here and they are making a strike against the oppression.Robert Carradine leads a lowstar cast full of geekcomedy stereotypes the loveable slob the token black guy with riddim' the fullofhimself jock the snobby and busty cheerleader etc Fortunately the characters are almost a pun on those of comedies like Animal House'  they don't take themselves too seriously. The actors have fun with their roles and that's always good to see. Robert Carradine proves to be a good actor  not the greatest in the world but surprisingly convincing. I'm pretty sure he's the brother son? of John Carradine I think so at least.The jokes in Revenge of the Nerds' sometimes fall flat the burping contest rings to mind but the film manages to mainly stay on course with what it tries to do have some fun and entertain the audience while giving slight courage to the nerds of these generations.Along in the joke category are the pranks the nerds pull on everyone who ever made fun of them they make a great array of boobytraps and pranks that would threaten even Macaulay Culkin's mad skills. The pranks are very funny although a few get out of hand the plate picture. Ask me why I like Revenge of the Nerds' so much and I can't really tell you why. Granted it's not a whole lot different or better than the illfated Police Academy.' Still it has some sort of feel' to it that a lot of eighties comedies had and have that just make the film worth watching. It grows on you. It's a bit like the feel of a campy movie except for a comedy. I'm going to have to think of a name for this eighties comedyfilm feeling. Perhaps I'll call it campeight' or something like that. I don't know. I just know that Revenge of the Nerds' is good entertainment.Before I bought Predator' on DVD about a year ago and before I bought it on video yes this has to do with Revenge of the Nerds' I rented it out on video in 1999. I had already seen it of course but I felt like watching it again. Anyway before the film there was a commercial where the camera scaled this decorated room with all kinds of gadgets and nerdy' stuff. Finally the camera came to rest on a chair and the back of someone's head. Then that someone' turned around to revealRobert Carradine saying We're baaaack!'I instantly felt both happy and sad.It was a commercial for Revenge of the Nerds II Nerds in Paradise.' I must say that the commercial made it look good but the sequel is just soso. The jokes mostly fall flat and are very reminiscent of the Police Academy' films and their downfalls. I just felt like adding this pointless paragraph to this review to tell you readers to ONLY watch the second film if it is on television. It is NOT worth renting. With that in mind go see Revenge of the Nerds' part I and have some fun. It's pure entertainment and is very campeight.' 3.55 stars John Ulmer".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1980s were different times in terms of gender politics but even by 80s standards this film is horribly misogynistic. In it a group of college men put video cameras into a women's sorority house and sit around watching the footage all night celebrating each time they see a female student's breasts or snatch. It gets worse. In order to win a college competition they sell photographs of one of the women topless. It gets worse. One of the men tricks this same woman into having sex with him by dressing in the costume her boyfriend is wearing. This rape is not simply treated comedically like the other sexism but the victim enjoys it so much she ditches her boyfriend and decides to go out with her attacker. The men involved in all these events are the heroes of the film. As nerds the film positions them as the victims of discrimination and harassment from the jocks. As viewers we are clearly invoked to desire and enjoy their revenge against their oppressors. Yet their most extreme acts of revenge are enacted against the women. Women who are given little or no characterisation. These nerd heroes are mostly white and middleclass yet they are constructed like an oppressed ethnicity. The fraternity they join is all black until they open their chapter. The climax of the film is a speech in which the central nerd declares 'I'm a nerd and I'm here tonight to stand up for the rights of other nerds. I mean uh all our lives we've been laughed at and made to feel inferior. ... Why? Because we're smart? Because we look different? Well we're not. I'm a nerd and uh I'm pretty proud of it.' This is nerd identity politics which puts their experiences on a level with groups who unlike nerds have the weight of social structures against them women African Americans LGBTQI etc. This positioning serves in the film as a cover for misogyny.".

Her deceased husband had been the mayor for years and when he died she was left to carry on and to raise his daughter from his first marriage. She lives with the daughter her fatherinlaw and a housekeeper. In the town square there was a statue of her late husband and every year since his death they have an anniversary celebration there. This year during a thunderstorm the statue is hit by lightning and the head falls off. The daughter insists that a new statue be erected instead of patching the old one. Mayor Crandall is sent to New York to interview the prospective sculptor George Corday. While there she gets involved in a nightclub raid and goes to jail after she is mistaken for the club's stripper. Back at home she tries to keep the scandal quiet and to forget Corday but he shows up and moves into her garage to work on the statue. Corday playfully uses the scandal to blackmail her into accepting his advances. Ann ...";

	schema:reviewBody "The DVD of this movie that I received from Netflix paired it with another Irene Dunne comedy vehicle the 1936 release Theodora Goes Wild and I can see why. Together Again a generic title by the way and one that doesn't even really make much sense borrows many plot points from that earlier film and rearranges them just enough to prevent this film from being a straight remake.Dunne plays the upstanding mayor of a provincial town who resists falling for an artist from the city Charles Boyer when she hires him to create a new statue for the town square. The statue happens to be of her late husband the town's previous mayor whose legacy Dunne has spent the years since his death trying to live up to. She becomes involved in a minor scandal while staying in the city and tries to keep it from the town once she returns. But Boyer playfully uses it to blackmail her into accepting his advances. An additional storyline involving Dunne's daughter and her boyfriend adds some amusing complications to the situation.This film is a little bit of nothing but it's cute and entertaining. It doesn't make any sense plot developments spring out of thin air and characters turn on a dime. But Dunne and Boyer make a good pair and it's easy to see why they collaborated frequently. They have a lot of chemistry and I've never liked Boyer better than here where he gets to show his comedic charming side. Terrific character actor Charles Coburn plays Dunne's fatherinlaw whose purpose in life is to get Dunne married again. Some of the film's funniest moments come from hearing the things he says about his own granddaughter a neurotic teenager who drives him crazy.There's a clever little weather motif running through the film that I liked very much and that ties the otherwise scattershot screenplay together rather nicely.Grade B".

She has inherited his post and lives with her stepdaughter Freeman and her fatherinlaw Coburn. Crandall Sr. Coburn wants Anne to get out and enjoy life but Anne in very un'40s style enjoys her career and life and doesn't need a man. One night during a thunderstorm lightning strikes the statue of her husband in the town square and knocks off his head. Anne is rushed to New York City to interview George Corday Boyer a sculptor to do a new statue. There's an instant attraction which Anne pretends doesn't exist. After a series of misadventures Anne decides she doesn't want Corday in her hometown and leaves New York. He follows.Dunne looks great and shows her wonderful comic style and Boyer just drips with charm in this. Coburn does a good job as her irascible fatherinlaw. Jerome Courtland is Diana's Freeman boyfriend and he does a nice comic turn. A very young Freeman turns in a good performance as Diana.I read some negative reviews here. I found this to be a delightful comedy thanks in large part to both Dunne and Boyer with good support from Coburn. Is it The Philadelphia Story? No but it's very enjoyable. And those hats!

When this movie came out just before Christmas 1944 WW II in Europe had just been prolonged with the German offensive in the Battle of the Bulge. So that Christmas at home this film was likely another welcome escape. A superb cast support Dunne and Boyer as Mayor Anne Crandall and sculptor George Corday respectively. Charles Coburn has one of his excellent roles as a supporting actor. He plays Jonathan Crandall Sr. Mona Freeman is a riot as the teenage daughter of Anne Diana Crandall. Jerome Courtland is very funny as Gilbert Parker and Charles Dingle shines as the boisterous publisher of the local newspaper Morton Buchanan.The special effects and camera crews did some outstanding work with scenes of lightning in the sky. The very end of the film is a masterpiece of film work. The dialog in this comedyromance is so good that a few samples are in order.

	schema:reviewBody "Even one of the most gifted and effervescent comediennes of Hollywood's golden era can't rescue the weak silly and sexist script. Yet again Hollywood of the 1940s insists that a successful woman isn't complete and can't be happy unless she has a man  and invariably the plot is going to demand that she give up her career because a relationship with a man is the only thing that matters. It's a premise that becomes increasingly hard to swallow as we get further and further away from the 1940s and 1950s. Charles Boyer plays the bohemian sculptor who dresses like Saville Row who she enlists to duplicate a statue of her husband with graces the small town where she is Mayor having succeeded her husband who died. Charles Coburn is reliable comedic support as her fatherinlaw who relentlessly insists that her first womanly duty is to loosen up  in later years they'd say that she should get laid  and go for the man. There's a subplot about her precocious teen daughter who falls for Boyer and the daughter's lanky boyfriend who then falls for Dunne. It's a duplicate setup of an I Love Lucy episode a few years later. The film is forced farfetched silly basically unfunny. The stars struggle to bring a levity and wit that are simply missing from the dialogue situations or premise. Dunne is so fetching physically lovely at the height of her beauty and could deliver a line arch an eyebrow tilt her head laugh and make every man just fall in love with her me included. She transcends an inferior script not exactly enough to make the movie enjoyable since it's mindlessly silly and predictable and beneath the talents of the principal cast but she is simply captivating. Charles Vidor also manages to inject some sparkle with his deft touch to a sparkleless script.".

There's a subplot about her precocious teen daughter who falls for Boyer and the daughter's lanky boyfriend who then falls for Dunne. It's a duplicate setup of an I Love Lucy episode a few years later. The film is forced farfetched silly basically unfunny. The stars struggle to bring a levity and wit that are simply missing from the dialogue situations or premise. Dunne is so fetching physically lovely at the height of her beauty and could deliver a line arch an eyebrow tilt her head laugh and make every man just fall in love with her me included. She transcends an inferior script not exactly enough to make the movie enjoyable since it's mindlessly silly and predictable and beneath the talents of the principal cast but she is simply captivating. Charles Vidor also manages to inject some sparkle with his deft touch to a sparkleless script.";

Scandal finds her instead when he takes her to a notorious strip club that gets raided. He follows her back which gives her political rival Charles Dingle some ammunition to boot her out of office.Dunne and Boyer's third pairing is their only comedy and not a great one.

The delightful Charles Coburn once again steals every moment he is on screen as her old rascal of a fatherinlaw anxious to see her remarried presumably so his granddaughter by his son's first wife will stop pestering him. Coburn gets the kind of material that made him so amusing in the Jean Arthur films The Devil and Miss Jones The More the Merrier and The Impatient Years.The stars do share chemistry but when the story begins to get a bit serious the interest comes to a grinding halt.Dunne is still able to perform a pratfall or two looks lovely in a scene where she strips down to her negligee and sings I Get Ideas in French charmingly. But when all is said and done this is simply another variation of Theodora Goes Wild without the smalltown parody present and as a result not nearly as funny.The lovestarved stepdaughter briefly bogs the plot down with juvenile foolishness.

Yet oddly she bought it to make herself more attractive. This was a miserable failure! As for the film Irene Dunne plays a very emotionally constricted widow who is the mayor of a small town. Since her husband's death her life has been her job and her fatherinlaw the wonderful Charles Coburn wants her to live a littledate and have some fun. But she is a seemingly hopeless case and carries her husband's memory around like an albatross around her neck. By chance she has a meeting with an artist Charles Boyer. Boyer is a French romantic and she is obviously bothered by him. Very crazy things ensue and the ultimate result is pretty predictable but fun. Not a great film but a fun one.While the film was silly and enjoyable one problem with it was the annoying character played by Mona Freeman. She was onedimensional and impossible to believe as a real human being and the first 10 minutes she was in were the worst. Fortunately she was just a supporting characterand a badly written one. But on the other hand Charles Coburn played a most delightful characterfull of wonderful quips and easy to love. He made a career out of playing sweet manipulative guys like this such as in his Oscarwinning performance in The More The Merrier as well as gruff old goats. I make it a point to see him in everything and I am never disappointed! He managed to breath some life into this otherwise ordinary film.By the way in the elevator scene look at the elevator operator. That's Alfalfa Switzerof the Li'l Rascals fame.

My favorite director of these action flicks was and still is LiuChiLiangLau Kar Leung.This legendary director is himself a marital artist able to trace his mastery from demihero Wong Fei Hung and imparts adherence to the art of kungfu in every movie he directs andor choreographs. His greatest screen triumph comes in the form of The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter Invincible Pole Fighter.2 A compelling storyline  Mongols with the help of an insider ambush the influential Yang Family defenders of the dynasty. The Mongols must hunt down all Yang survivors so their insidious plot to overthrow the dynasty will not be uncovered.3 An allstar cast  Those who watch films of the Shaw Brothers will recognize the familiar faces of the charismatic dynamo Gordon Liu Chia Hui kung fu babe Kara Hui YingHung legendary Lily Li superstar Alexander Fu Sheng in his last screen role alltime bad guy Johnny Wang Lung Wei veteran Phillip Ko Fei talented Hsiao Ho technical Lau Kar Wing heroic Wong Yu and Lau Kar Leung himself.3 Unobtrusive use of wirefu or special effects  At least there are no quadruple flips and people flipping off swords i.e. Swordsman 2.4 The greatest pole fighting sequence filmed  Gordon Liu wants revenge. Phillip Ko Fei denies this bloodlust. Watch them engage in a fantastic duel of ethics and poles.5 The climactic end sequence  Words cannot describe the mayhem involved. Only the finale of films such as Drunken Master 2 and Thundering Mantis can compare. Must be seen to be believed.6 No gratuitous humor While not everyone can have the sense of humor of a Jacky Chan or Sammo Hung many martial arts films have comical segmentselements that take away from the overall picture.Take Lau Kar Leung's masterful Legendary Weapons of KungFu.' The entire Alexander Fu Sheng subplot of the crackpot martial artist could've been done without the cross eyes and silly music.Chang Cheh's 10 Tiger's of Kwangtung' had many memorable moments but a couple of comedic attempts such as the overly long 'torture training' and the bystander who lounges about and watches a duel at close range distracts.In 8 Diagram Pole Fighter' there is no mixing of genres. What you get is a smashmouth kungfu action movie.7 Themes  This movie is not just about kungfu and revenge. It deals with family honor. Loyalty to one's country. Loyalty to a group. Belief in one's self. And ultimately  belonging.8 Gordon Liu  As the main star of this movie Gordon cements his place in kungfu film history as one of the baddestasses ever. Here's an elite warrior that goes to Shaolin Temple to IMPROVE his killing skills. In particular his first encounter against a Mongol outpost is the stuff of action film legend.I feel so strongly about this movie that it not only is my favorite martial arts film it currently ranks as my favorite movie. It stands above my other favorites which include The Godfather Golgo 13 The Seven Samurai On the Waterfront 12 Angry Men  High Noon Monty Python's Holy Grail because it stands the test of repeated viewings and never fails to fill me with the full gamut of all emotions leaving me more passionate about my life my family and my destiny.Maybe it's the coffee talking. Maybe I need to get out more. Nevertheless I offer a toast to all other 8 Diagram Pole Fighter' fans around the world new and old.".

The whole mood is set from the incredible opening credits sequence and all throughout the film. Gordon Liu is Yang 6 a man bent on seeking revenge.  His pole fighting is amazing in this one in both battle and training.

	schema:headline " A classic of the genre";
	schema:reviewBody "Since getting into the genre a few years ago I have seen many kung fu films of this era and I have to say this is one of my favourites. I was lucky enough to find a wide screen undubbed version.This is a classic Shaw Bros. style film by famed director Lau KarLeung and starring Gordon Liu 6th Brother whom Tarantino paid homage to by giving two roles in Kill Bill I  II.The father of the Yang family and his seven sons go to battle to fight the Mongols who are threatening the Sung Dynasty. They are betrayed by a rival family and only two brothers 6th Liu and 5th survive. 6th takes refuge at a Generalturnedhunter's rural hideout the General is a cameo by director KarLeung before fleeing to a monastery where his brash personality conflicts with the monks there. At the monastery he must improve his skills before seeking vengeance on those responsible for his family's betrayal.The first fight scene the battle is a little cheesy with an obvious screened backdrop a setting that doesn't really fit with the rest of the film. If the film was more ambitious this could have been a more impressive outdoor battle. But this is the film's only real drawback. The fights start out great and only get better. Highlights include 8th Sister's really breathtaking swordplay and 6th Brother's duel with the Abbott which is both acrobatic and beautiful. This fight ends poetically as during the fight both men had enscribed a yinyang symbol on the floor of the monastery symbolic of these two men's conflicting personalities peaceful monk and warrior General.The final scene is an allout bloody melee which is really impressive especially when 6th Brother takes on the horde with 8th Sister strapped to his back. Some of it is overacted extreme reactions from bad guys as teeth are knocked out! but used as a source of campy amusement it only adds to the whole spectacle.The plot is strong and very Shakespearean in scope family loyal to the ruler is betrayed family members must communicate in secret to avoid discovery while revenge is planned. The idea of the poles which use a twisty grapplingend to counter the Yang family's poles is unique. I love the fact that like in many other films of the genre the women's kung fu skills are as strong as the men's. This 20 years before the whole girl power thing in Western movies music  TV.If you're a fan of kung fu see this film if you get a chance!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Yang family are masters at fighting with spears. During the Battle of Jinsha against the evil Tartars all the brothers are cruelly massacred except General Yang Wulang Liu known to his family as 5th Son and Yang Liulang Fu Sheng known as 6th son. When 6th Son returns home he goes insane after witnessing all the horror and treachery foisted upon him and his family by the evil Pan Mei Ke Ming Lin. His mother and sisters have to now care for him and deal with his mental illness. Meanwhile General Yang goes on a soulsearching quest. Because Pan Mei was once close with the Yang family even bestowing upon them the honorific title of Family of Loyalty after he defected to the side of evil he officially became a traitor. Yang saying I can't go home and I can't avenge my country is caught in a limbo of sorts and ends up at a remote monastery for Buddhist Monks.He wishes very much to become a monk but he keeps being rebuffed by the Abbot saying he's too warlike too angry too confused and most importantly too concerned with worldly affairs. Nevertheless noting his ability with spearfighting they remove the blade and teach him all over again to fight with just the pole. The ultimate test is to Defang the wolf using wooden wolves for practice. Now sufficiently trained he must face off against Pan Mei and his Tartar goons  and reunite withsave his sister  in the ultimate final showdown.Even though we really don't review them hopefully that will change in the near future we love 70's and 80's Martial Arts cinema especially the output of Shaw Brothers. Eight Diagram Pole Fighter stands out as an excellent highly enjoyable example of the genre the sets and costumes are artistically and beautifully designed the choreography and fighting is superb and there are plenty of cool battles. Additionally fan favorite  nay  HERO  Gordon Liu puts in an emotional intense performance as General Yang a troubled man and lost soul  until he finds his purpose in life. This thoughtful performance shows there's much more to these kinds of movies than just chop socky. Plus the plot is accessible to a general Western viewer without too many cultural idiosyncracies that sometimes make foreign films of this kind hard to understand. Everyone should see this fine film! Make sure you get the Dragon Dynasty DVD as there have been inferior quality versions floating around for many years now. This is the definitive way to see this great movie. Because it is so wellshot and even operatic at times it would be a shame to see one of those horribly panandscanned dubbed atrocities. It's because of those bootlegs and even many legitimate releases that Martial Arts movies of this kind get a bad rap. 8 Diagram Pole Fighter can stand with any kind of foreign film. But the snobby crowd will never think to even recognize that. But it's easy to see why rappers like WuTang appreciate this kind of movie. They were certainly ahead of the curve as RZA expresses his appreciation for this movie in his book.Also thanks to the dynamism of the movie and Liu's compelling performance many people stole from it. Just see American Shaolin 1991 Everything from the plot about the guy who desperately wants to become a monk but faces opposition to the training sequences was recycled by this and later films. But it's done so well here and is so enjoyable to watch especially with the unique wooden wolves it's best to come to the original source.For fans of Martial Arts cinema this is a mustsee. For nonfans...well...this is a mustsee. Recommended.".

Five of the 7 brothers are killed along with the father.Gordon Liu escapes and joins the Shaolin Temple as they are very hesitant in excepting him. I won't drag this to long but the end fight had a very unique flavor. Instead of killing most of their enemies the Shaolin Monks performed an act called defanging the wolf meaning they knocked out their teeth. The last guy really got it bad but honestly the only bad thing about this film is that Fu Sheng did not fight with brother 6 and sister 8. I found out that Fu Sheng had died in a car accident while filming this movie that's why he was not in the end fight.But as I said before forget these other reviewers that think Bruce Lee is the only one that can make good movies hell wire fu is what made some of these movies legendary The Matrix is living proof. In the end don't believe the hype about this movie being good. Believe the hype about it being off the chain!!!!! 910".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the last film Liu Chia Liangaka Lau Kar Leung made for Shaw Brothers Studios and in my opinion it is probably his best. After doing much lighter comedic fare like My Young Auntieof which I champion and highly recommend as well Liu Chia Liang took this project in a darker more violent and much more serious direction. Gordon Liu stars in this kung fu epic and is in top fighting form and gives an excellent acting performance as the lead. He plays a brother from a royal family who was betrayed and his father and brothers were slaughtered in an ambush. He finds sanctuary in a Shaolin temple and becomes a monk. As usual in a Gordon LiuLiu Chia Liang production the storytelling is fluent the acting is solid and the fights are awesome. The old Shaw sets look great and there is an abundance of fights as well. They are very well choreographed but also very brutal and bloody. Shaw Brothers is well known for having quality productions but The 8 Diagram Polefighter is a flawless production where all the elements come together for a perfect martial arts film. Great story acting direction and some of the best and most intense fight scenes ever filmed put The 8 Diagram Polefighter heads and shoulders above most other martial arts films. The 8 Diagram Polefighter is a must for any martial arts fan and this title gets my highest recommendation. On a sad note it is unfortunate that Alexander Fu Sheng died in a car accident during the making of this film and could have had a bigger part if he was alive and well.RIP bro".

	schema:headline " Latestage Shaw Brothers action classic watch out for the wolf defanging technique!";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite its late arrival this can still be considered a classic Shaw Brothers movie and has remained muchloved by fans since its first release. Although there's a lowered budget  somehow the sets aren't so impressive this time around  the film still offers solid sometimes fantastic martial arts bouts and plenty of action to keep it moving nicely along. My only complaint is with the costumes which thanks to the low budget now look rather tawdry and poor. I mean some of the bad guys wear leopard skins and others wear Santa Claus costumes! As is typical for the genre the story is nothing special but provides a nice basis for the action. The opening sequence is a confusing massacre with some really violent action in it including a man scalped and a guy turned into a pin cushion with about two dozen arrows. From then on the film mainly charts the course of lead Gordon Liu as he seeks solitude in a Shaolin temple and comes up against some monks who teach him the ways of wooden pole fighting. The fights are hard and fast and include some imaginative scenes in which fullsize wooden wolves are used as training devices! Liu is excellent as the lead and brings sympathy to his character despite the usual dodgy dubbing and his scenes contrast nicely with his only other surviving brother now turned mad.The film piles on the action with a series of minor characters the farmer the monk heroically dying after facing off against tons of enemies my favourite when a guy pulls a wall down on top of the opposition and himself. There are some strong female characters in the forms of Liu's shapely sisters who show off some mean martial arts abilities. Any fan of the Shaw Brothers will be expecting a gruesome finale and THE INVINCIBLE POLE FIGHTERS delivers on all accounts in this respect. The main bad guy gets his face shredded and smashed through a coffin and another theme seems to be teethpulling as most of the villains find their gobs smashed and their teeth flying all over the place! Bloody brilliant stuff and a terrific finale to the film. Any martial arts fan should check this film out immediately just to watch the classic action endless pole fighting and superhuman manoeuvres.".

	schema:reviewBody "Allow me to backtrack a bit if you will please...A few years ago I saw The 36th Chamber of Shaolin 1978 which I consider to be the next greatest martial arts film after the Bruce Lee masterpiece that is Enter the Dragon 1973. I must say that The 36th Chamber of Shaolin was the film to introduce me to what I call straightup oldschool Shaw Brothers kungfu. A year or so before I saw that I had seen Five Fingers of Death 1972 widely considered to be the first internationally successful martial arts film and another Shaw Brothers classic Five Deadly Venoms 1978.Today I had the pleasure to see yet another Shaw Brothers classic The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter directed in 1984 by Hong Kong kungfu master Liu ChiaLiangLau KarLeung who also directed The 36th Chamber of Shaolin just six years earlier. Like the The 36th Chamber of Shaolin and many other martial arts classics The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter is a story of revenge and retribution and redemption with a strong Buddhist philosophical subtext warning against the evils of killing and taking lives under any circumstances.Set during the Song Dynasty in China the story concerns Fifth Yang Gordon Liu held over from The 36th Chamber of Shaolin the only survivor along with Sixth Yang the late Alexander Fu who died in a car accident during filming and the film had to be extensively rewritten because of this of the seven Yang sons the loyal enforcers for the Song Dynasty. With the exceptions of Fifth Yang and Sixth Yang all the Yang sons and their father were all either captured or killed by the Khitanruled Liao Dynasty army forces.Sixth Yang makes it back home but he's in a volatile deranged state that will make him unable to positively identify the primary culprit in the slaughter of his brothers and father the traitorous Song Dynasty general General Pun Mei Ming Ku. Fifth Yang however now falsely labeled a fugitive and a traitor makes it to a nearby Buddhist monastery in Mount Wutai and insists that the monks take him in as their newest disciple. At first they are reluctant due to his violent nature and revenge motives but over time they grow impressed by his pole fighting skills and accept him as one of their own. But when he learns that his family is still in danger he must join them  along with his sister Eighth Yang Kara Hui credited here by her birth name Ying Hung Wai  despite the Buddhist vows of nonviolence that he has taken.The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter is as exciting and actionpacked as a Hong Kongproduced Shaw Brothers kungfu classic can get. While the film does not approach the epic greatness of The 36th Chamber of Shaolin which this film can probably be considered a companion piece to The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter stands on its own two feet as yet another worthy kungfu classic.One of my biggest gripes is that I expected to see Gordon Liu's Fifth Yang to actually change his ways and eventually have his revenge motives tempered by some greater desire to help others in need. That doesn't really happen here. While his character does indeed take his Buddhist vows very seriously or at least gives the appearance that he does he doesn't become a better person and still retains his violent nature and revenge motives. The other problem is that the monks sort of accept this and realize that they cannot truly change him. And while the monks do accept him as one of their own it seems to me that the only thing they can really do is to harness his anger and try to channel it into nonlethal means the whole business with wolves and their teeth which you'll see if you watch the training sequences at the Buddhist monastery. Liu's character San Te in The 36th Chamber of Shaolin did not face these glaring ethical issues.Maybe I'm reading things incorrectly here so if anybody has any insight feel free to correct me here.On the plus side The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter has some of the most extraordinary polefighting sequences ever filmed. I've never seen anything like it prior to this. And the film is also quite bloody too one of the most graphically violent martial arts films I've seen in fact since probably Fists of FuryThe Big Boss 1971 with Bruce Lee. And while the boys often get the most screen time Kara Hui's Eighth Yang proves to be a formidable kungfu presence and can more than handle her own against the legions of disposable of bad guys sent in her general direction. In short she's no damsel in distress  she's far from it.Gordon Liu also delivers a powerhouse performance here. To know that Alexander Fu was originally supposed to be the lead here and with his tragic passing the film had to be extensively reworked due to his death. Gordon Liu admirably stepped in his place to finish the film. Admittedly it would be great to see what would have become of this film had Alexander Fu lived to complete it.The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter is one of the best martial arts films I've ever seen. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to bask myself in its 97 minutes of epic kungfu craziness.810".

In a martial arts movie its essential to have amazing fights between characters. Anyway this movie is originally called 7 brothers in china and if you remember Pai Mei or really good fighter of the crazy 88 from Kill Bill that is Gordan Liu. The plot is actually pretty good for a action movie he's ambushed and how to defeat his family is given away before they begin to fight so his martial arts are now worthless. So with Gordan Liu minus his brothers he goes to find an improved method of fighting but the shaolin monks he seeks don't take him in since he'll inevitably kill again once he learns the martial art. He actually has to change his mentality to be accepted and learn the art of pole fighting.Fights are great in this movie Gordan liu is amazing when he's not fighting anyone i.e. moving his pole around at the pond try moving with that kind of power and precision on your own and see how good Mr. Liu is. Also I really enjoyed the final fight scene very fluid and well choreographed most martial arts movies now have maybe one good fight sequence at the beginning and then... well... CGI plays a larger and larger role throughout the movie and the martial part of martial arts disappears and you're left with an art show.".

It was made in 1983 which seems to explain the crappy costuming. In my humble opinion the costumes are grotesque and gaudy. We are talking liquid gold and leopard skins. The plot was very jumbled and not very clear. The classic Kung Fu training sequences were not very long or explanatory. And if you've seen the movie you will know how lame the wolf training dummies were. And for being called The Invincible Pole Fighter' he seemed to be the exact opposite One redeeming quality was the cool ass bendy poles that the Mongols used to entrap the Yang's spears. They were highly annoying to the heroes and the audience. A real sense of hopelessness. One good thing was the intensity of the final fight scene. A real cliffhanger.".

I find the story lines of these Shaw films extremely uninvolving because the characters remind me of narrowminded religious zealots whose thought processes are collective. That gripe aside this is a feast of fight choreography and holds a special place in the Shaw canon. Its plot turns are incomprehensible at times and its dialog is stilted but it's still impressive. The Celestial DVD boasts an exceptional clean print. The colors are strong and the transfer is sharp. I'm just not a big fan of period martial arts films but I do appreciate their artistry.

This was one of Lau Kar Leung's final masterpieces and the movie he was dying to make Both movies star Gordon Liu as a young man who transitions from a life of political intrigue to Buddhist Monk. While both movies depict the rewards of hard work as the hero overcomes the struggles of trying to adhere to a new life it a also doesn't shy back away from the difficulties of staying true to his new beliefs when loved ones are endangered and the same evil men continue to oppress the people a detached monk can't stop caring about.Emotions run incredibly high in 8 Diagram Pole Fighter but while a bit overdramatic it is sure not to disappoint fans and new comers to this genre of movies. 8 Pole Diagram Fighter is simply put a movie you have to see to believe.

Like most of his early Dutch films you can feel many of the hallmarks of his style coming together and it's a testament to his skill as a director that he can make a small characterdriven film about ordinary people like SPETTERS every bit as compelling as a gigantic special effects driven spectacle like ROBOCOP.This is an 80's disco motocross movie that has very little disco and very little motocross. What it has are many strong characters all of them navigating life transitions and trying to figure out their place in the world.As for the shocking scenes that a lot of people are referring to in the posts there is a fair amount of sex and nudity male especially in this film but to call it shocking is misleading. The reason the film's frank treatment of sexuality is so eye opening is the way Verhoeven handles it as no big deal. Two men sneak into a subway for a tryst and you actually see one of the guys go down on the other guy. Two pairs of teenagers sneak into an abandoned building to have sex and you see it. Or when a man and a woman lay in bed talking after having sex you see the guy totally naked as well as the girl. What happens happens and it's presented as is.Verhoeven doesn't cut away from nudity but at the same time doesn't artificially sexualize it by zooming in it laying in sexy background music etc etc. Like the coed shower scene in STARSHIP TROOPERS it's presented in a completely matter of fact way. Verhoeven doesn't allude to anything in these scenes and it gives the film a power and honesty and that wouldn't be there otherwise.Overall I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie to anyone.Bart Blackstone  Film Club Hollywood CA".

Twentyfour years later and unlike what has happened with Showgirls Paul is having the last laugh. Even his worst film 1995's Showgirls has a glimmer of redeeming value but the difference in Spetters is that it doesn't need any.At heart Spetters is the tale of two young amateur motocross racers and their mechanic. Along with their girlfriend their lives are irrevocably altered when they cross paths with a fast food vendor and her brother. The whole film runs like a slice of life and nothing that happens in real life is too distasteful for the camera.If you don't want elements of the plot revealed you can stop reading now.The film has been accused of being antigay antiwomen and antidisabled. Once again Verhoeven gets the last laugh when it becomes clear to anyone who watches it with their eyes open that none of these things are true. The story of one character's sexual confusion is played out in graphic detail sure but it is portrayed exactly as it would happen in real life. Sure not every experience of homosexuality is as negative as in Spetters but enough are to make this portrayal valid. The main woman of the story simply manipulates the situation or uses it as best she can to escape a situation she wants out of. Any woman with an ounce of strength in her character will do the same. The character who winds up paralysed finds himself reflecting on what he has lost and it is enough to make him lose all sense of value in his life. Again this happens every day in the real world.There is a reason why films by Paul Verhoeven attract a certain kind of fan. Regardless of whether he succeeds or fails with his artistic goals I have yet to see him sell out to the lowest common denominator. I have also never seen a film directed by Verhoeven where the camera is moved extraneously obscuring details for fear of what the MPAA might have to say. The viewer is spared no details even if it might make them turn from the screen in disgust.If I could sum up Spetters in one word it would be relentless. I've seen many a film or television show that claims to show what kind of extreme pressures teenagers or young adults live under. Spetters is the first film I have seen in two decades that even makes the attempt and better still it comes uncomfortably close. All in all I consider it worthy of a nine out of ten. There are some elements that seem at odds with what Verhoeven would like us to believe they mean but the effect overall is surprisingly good. Anyone who wants to see what would happen if they merged realistic versions of your typical Brat Packer film with a realistic version of Days Of Thunder will be wellserved by checking out Spetters.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found Spetters was one of the most true to life teen to adult coming of age films made in the 1980's that didn't get the credit or respect it deserved.Spetters takes an ensemble cast and manges to touch upon each piece of the joys and anguish of growing up at this age in a small town. What appeals the most to me about Spetters is that even though this is filmed in Europe the locationscinematography is small town anywhere! The ensemble cast is also small town anyone and very appealing.The ages 19 and 20 are one of the first notable changes of your life and Spetters addresses those turning point decisions well. 19 is the end of the teen years and 20 is not quite yet the adult so for these two years you are seriously thinking about how to make your way in the world  what is your talent have you made the right decision to go into business stay at home finish college date heavily marry and most of all you are both questioning and coming to grips with WHO YOU ARE. In Spetters some are running away from who they are others are embracing it while still others are met with an unexpected future that destroys all of their future hopes and dreams.At 19 and 20  we all think we are indestructible. Spetters addresses this and the subsequent handling of tragedy and loss both physical and mental. Add in the outside factors of friends sexuality family community religion  each and more shape in how these decisions play themselves out in their lives.Spetters is filmed like you are watching life as it progresses day by day  it begins in the same place as it ends. Spetters is about three young men who live in a small town yearning to get out the only way they know how via motor cross sport. All three men think they have the talent to make an be a champion in the sport like their hometown hero and one in fact does posses the talent to go far while the other two are placed in subordinate positions just to look from the outside in. Insert a smart pretty and sexy young woman and her brother who have gone from town to town selling 'questionable' food snacks at the races. The woman also secretly yearns for something as well real love financial security and permanence. While at a stop over in this town she sees potential in one of the men and takes it for all she's got the only way she knows how.Spetters does have explicit sexual situations that drive the film in my opinion. And I'll admit prior to seeing this film there is much I had no idea took place. I would assume this might make the film as shocking for some viewers as it was for me. The frame of mind surviving daily in this small town and other growth situations of this group of characters are very important so their sexual developmentexploits regardless of how shocking are there to remind you of how these characters 'live'. And be warned the sexual situations are heterosexual as well as homosexual rape and consensual.Spetters is a brilliant film of daily life love and tragedy. If you can get the uncut unrated version in its original language do. That is the first way I saw on on the Los Angeles based Z Channel and I am for all foreign director's visions to be seen uncut unedited undubbed and experienced in the vision of which they wanted to present it. A strong NC17 USA Code film.".

It's about three young cocky Dutch guys whose lives revolve around Motorcross racing and their encounters with a cute ambitious smart workingclass girl who lives in a trailer and is a short order cook around the Motorcross site.It is ultrarealistic and true to life and at the same time overthetop and absurd to satirize the equally ridiculous but more fleeting absurdities of everyday life in fact 'real life' is much more absurd than anything that happens in this movie but 'toned down' and harder to notice except upon reflection.  With 'over the top' movies like Spetters the absurdities we all notice are turned 'way up high' for instant and easier identification and reflection. Other great movies of this type I've seen are Verhoeven's American version of Spetters Showgirls Sam Fuller's Shock Corridor Ken Russell's fantastic uncut version of Crimes of Passion and Mathew Bright's first Freeway but Spetters tops them all.  It is the ultimate masterpiece of 'overthetop' satire.Try to find a wellstocked video store that carries the uncensored subtitled Director's cut for rent it's got some very graphic sex scenes in it with full fronal nudity and a homosexual gang rape that makes anything in American Me look tame it's a well transferred version which came out on HBO video a few years ago and is now unavailable for sale for some reason I'd buy it in a second if it was available.".

The music by the Bee Gees moreover makes it look more like a record album vainly attempting to be a film. Second sexual repression in SNF more impacts the lives of the American kids than it does the Dutch boys. The garage scene in the latter film where the three young bikers compare erections to see who gets first crack at the carny galwould be judged too homoerotic for American audiences to take for instance. While the American boys go disco dancing for fun the dutch kids try testing their courage in more dangerous ways such as bike racing. While the only death in Spetters occurs when a biker deliberately crashes into a moving truck a suicide rather than living his life as an impotent cripple the American dies falling off a bridge while stunting! Even the role models for the two groups of young men are different. While John Travolta admires a poster of Al Pacino an actor on his bedroom wall and takes pride in his hairdo the bikers' hero is a national cyclist whom they want to emulate and become someday. Defining manhood in American terms becomes just another marketing toolsince Travolta has no aspirations to act while the three bikers know the way to manhood lies through courage not false glamor and appearances.The scene where one of the bikers gets paid back for robbing and beating gay men by being gangraped by toughlooking homosexuals is excellent. Here the tables are turned in a way we would never see in American films since gays are supposed to be victims who never fight back against their attackers. This demonstration of courage to defend one's honor and dignity makes Spetters a far superior film than SNF. SNF despite all its trendiness as a barometer of the seventies treats both its men and women as garden variety workingclass stereotypes. For genuine closeness heroism and malebonding check this one out at the video store make sure it's the uncut 123 min. DVD Director's version. A better comingofage film you will never see.".

	schema:headline " Much maligned minormasterpiece from Paul Verhoeven.";
	schema:reviewBody "Paul Verhoeven's muchunderrated film Spetters tells the typically brash and uncompromising story of three young men growing up in a sleepy village just outside of Rotterdam consumed by smalltown ennui and desperate for a life more glamorous and exciting than their own loafing existence of discothques motorcross and general everyday tedium. It has a lot in common with certain American teenmelodramas of the late 70's and early 80's films like Foxes Rumble Fish The Outsiders River's Edge etc though is shot through with that liberated European sensibility that probably has more in common with Fassbinder in terms of gritty stylisation. The story doesn't really advance on the initial set up with this being more of a character based film in the minorkey at odds with some of Verhoeven's better known films like Robocop Basic Instinct and The Fourth Man with the director drawing on the relationships between the lead characters and their various situations in order to elicit a greater sense of drama. The characters are all believable and likable to an extent  despite the opening scenes establishing them as a bunch of arrogant feckless possibly homophobic? punks only out for themselves  however as the film progresses Verhoeven and his scriptwriter Gerard Soeteman who collaborated with the director on all of his preHollywood films begin playing with notions of irony to strip away all the remnants of their confidence and selfassurance in a number of melodramatic tragedies.The film has a great style and feel to it with Verhoeven capturing the real feel of early80's Holland or so I'd imagine whilst also establishing a mood of endless possibilities for these three main characters. The early scenes of the film are quite bawdy and have a rather lighthearted and comedic tone to them which is important as it brings us into the world of the characters and allows us to become familiar with them before Verhoeven hits us with the hard stuff. When the film reaches the halfway mark Verhoeven and Soeteman introduce the character of Fientje a seductive hotdog vender who rolls into town with her bodybuilding brother on the day of the big motorcross championship only to immediately crosspaths with the three young bikers and the various other supporting players who will become more important towards the end of the film ...the dirt bike champion the TV reporter the hell's angels etc. Her presence in town is treated with hostility by many of the characters though ultimately she proves to be an important catalyst for many of the major events in the film enticing the three young men and seemingly persuading them that that can do anything.The film then takes it's Fassbinder aspirations to the next level with each scene escalating to a frenzied sense of melodrama and tragedy as Verhoeven introduces such themes as disability religious fanaticism homosexuality and suicide. Like all of the director's work not just his early Dutch films Spetters is both provocative and confrontational with Verhoeven always trying to get some kind of response out of the viewer. However whereas his early films like Business is Business and Turkish Delight seemed like they were flaunting their liberated sexuality as something of a badge of honour ...whilst his U.S. work is largely out to push buttons this film seems much more natural.The problems the three young men encounter in this film including parental abuse disability rape and ridicule are everyday occurrences... true they're exaggerated here so as Verhoeven can achieve a greater sense of resonance and drama but the whole thing seems all the more engaging and to some extent touching especially compared to the bloated melodrama of his later film Showgirls. It should be noted that Spetters although one of the best films of the 1980's in my opinion certainly isn't for everyone. It's probably the furthest Verhoeven has ever gone in terms of the on screen depiction of sexuality more so than The Fourth Man. Here for the first time in its fulluncut version though it has been shown uncut in the past on channels like Bravo and Film Four we see the director in his element mixing humour with drama action with tragedy and character with controversy.The oftdiscussed rape scene that happens halfway through the film is a real test for the audience not simply for what is depicted within the scene male gang rape replete with a brief erection but also within the overall context the protagonist eventually realises through the rape that he is indeed gay!. As well as this there's also a two second shot of actually falatio three erections as the boys make a wager as to who has the biggest!! and a moment between one of the boys Rien and the promiscuous Fientje in which she strokes his penis in closeup. There's also a scene in which one of the hell's angels gets hot fat poured over him some rather brutal scenes of domestic abuse and a violent suicide towards the end. Ultimately the film ends with a glimmer of hope building on top of the excellent style script and moments of drama that have been peppered throughout this great twohour film. The direction from Verhoeven here is exceptional whilst the performances in particularly those from Rene Soutendijk Maarten Spanjer and the tragic Hans van Tongeren whose death sadly mirrored that of his character here are all excellent and completely believable whilst there's some fine cameo support offered from Verhoeven regulars Jeroen Krabb and Rutger Hauer. Spetters for me is an extreme film and something of a minormasterpiece... it is also highly rewarding and engaging and ultimately is evidence enough that Verhoeven when taken away from films like Showgirls and Hollow Man is a great filmmaker.".

However whereas his early films like Business is Business and Turkish Delight seemed like they were flaunting their liberated sexuality as something of a badge of honour ...whilst his U.S. work is largely out to push buttons this film seems much more natural.The problems the three young men encounter in this film including parental abuse disability rape and ridicule are everyday occurrences... true they're exaggerated here so as Verhoeven can achieve a greater sense of resonance and drama but the whole thing seems all the more engaging and to some extent touching especially compared to the bloated melodrama of his later film Showgirls. It should be noted that Spetters although one of the best films of the 1980's in my opinion certainly isn't for everyone. It's probably the furthest Verhoeven has ever gone in terms of the on screen depiction of sexuality more so than The Fourth Man. Here for the first time in its fulluncut version though it has been shown uncut in the past on channels like Bravo and Film Four we see the director in his element mixing humour with drama action with tragedy and character with controversy.The oftdiscussed rape scene that happens halfway through the film is a real test for the audience not simply for what is depicted within the scene male gang rape replete with a brief erection but also within the overall context the protagonist eventually realises through the rape that he is indeed gay!. As well as this there's also a two second shot of actually falatio three erections as the boys make a wager as to who has the biggest!! and a moment between one of the boys Rien and the promiscuous Fientje in which she strokes his penis in closeup. There's also a scene in which one of the hell's angels gets hot fat poured over him some rather brutal scenes of domestic abuse and a violent suicide towards the end. Ultimately the film ends with a glimmer of hope building on top of the excellent style script and moments of drama that have been peppered throughout this great twohour film. The direction from Verhoeven here is exceptional whilst the performances in particularly those from Rene Soutendijk Maarten Spanjer and the tragic Hans van Tongeren whose death sadly mirrored that of his character here are all excellent and completely believable whilst there's some fine cameo support offered from Verhoeven regulars Jeroen Krabb and Rutger Hauer. Spetters for me is an extreme film and something of a minormasterpiece... it is also highly rewarding and engaging and ultimately is evidence enough that Verhoeven when taken away from films like Showgirls and Hollow Man is a great filmmaker.";

It's even become a trip down memoryland back to the good old eighties when I was a teenager myself.It's a story that could have happened in real life. It shows the conservativeness of the heavily reformed Christians in the Netherlands in an excellent way and it still goes like that nowadays. The Netherlands are well known for it's liberality but be aware there is a other side to the Netherlands to that isn't liberal at all and it's shows in this movie. The way Eef's father is raising him and the way Eef is resisting his father is something i've seen a lot in real life.One slight downfall from the movie is the way Eef found out he was gay. As he didn't actually seem to have any problems with the ladies it's hard to buy that he suddenly became gay after he was raped. There were not any signals before. As for the homophobic humor well we all like to think we have the biggest one and the way it was handled is typical dutch. We are liberal about sex and like to joke about it. You feel for the characters and it's got heart. And that's always a hell of a achievement.Furthermore i was surprised to see so many high raids by people outside the Netherlands. It's a typical liberal dutch story so i'm surprised to see that people outside the Netherlands seem to understand the movie better then the people that commented the movie from the Netherlands.".

It's amazing.As if no man in real life ever gets an erection as if no woman ever idly plays with a man's penis as if it were a flower as if young straight men never compare the size of their penises. ALL of that happens in real life but in a movie? HA! It should but it doesn't.So the way the male body and sex are treated in this movie is much more extraordinary and refreshing than it ought to be. Otherwise this movie is okay but a little tiresome.The focus on motorcycle racing is tedious. The acting is okay but not great the movie's only two experienced actors  Jeroen Krabb and Rutger Hauer  overact to such a clownish extent that it's embarrassing but maybe that's just how Dutch actors are taught to act because the novices are a lot more realistic.The story is not particularly engaging and not at all believable particularly one character's violent comingout. And the woman who drives all the men crazy looks to me like a Cabbage Patch Kid with WAY too much makeup on  not sexy AT ALL  but then I'm gay so I'm often dumbfounded by what turns straight men on.".

Still they are all needed for the story and to understand the motivations of the guys. It's welldirected by Paul Verhoeven has a pulsating soundtrack moves quickly and has good actingespecially by Soutendijk and Agterberg. It has tragic and hopeful endings for all the guys done in a realistic and truthful manner. Also Rutger Hauer has a small role as a conceited motocross champion.Verhoeven who also wrote the script was attacked for this film. It was called antigay antiwoman anticripple and way too sexually explicit I do wonder how he got some of the actors to agree to perform in some of these scenesespecially the gay rape. He only made one more film in Holland The 4th Man before coming to Hollywood and turning out one blockbuster after another. This was barely shown in the US and was put on cable in a horribly cut R rated print with dubbing! This review is based on the subtitled directors cut. This film may be way too graphic for some viewers but I was fascinated through the whole thing. Recommended.".

This criticism whether conscious or not is most obvious in the story of Rien Hartman who kills himself not because he is in a wheelchair per se but because he can no longer get it up even when his girlfriend tries to give him a blowjob. His manliness and potence is so important to him in this smalltown macho culture that he does not feel human without an erect penis. Of course plenty of people are disabled and live decent lives but many are able to release their frustration over what they had by finding an inner peace through meditation or something similar. Rien never even considers such a thing because his culture does not allow it. The only religious outlet he has is the occult version of Christianity that is depicted in the film a kind of extroverted showy social religion with nothing to offer the inner soul of the individual except temporary escape. Rien refuses to accept even this both due to his own internal weakness and also due to its social character which he feels shamed by.Verhoeven depicts a world with only fake spirituality and no real values except for crusade and conquest. Sexual predationconquest financial opportunism hypocritical preachers reporters and businessmen are plentiful but there is little give and take. People take action with limited vision seeing only themselves and their own interests rather than a larger humanity or their place in it.In SNF the girl is a pathetic hangeron who is raped in the end by her own friends for fun because to them she is worth nothing because she gives herself no worth. In Spetters the girl is strong but opportunistic and there is a scene where you see the complexity and guilt of her character underneath the facade. The sexual stuff is accomplished with the closeted homosexual character who is brutally raped for sport and then ironically becomes gay because of it. As in SNF but in a more artistic and ironic way the values are all skewed for these people. But in SNF dancing provides a temporary outlet for this macho culture and ultimately it seems that there is escape for the main character if he can just get out of his class. There is escape possible for the woman in Spetters too yet it isn't clear that the escape will be better than the current reality and the only one who really escapes is the predatory brother.In any case as one of the better social films of the past 40 years I give it 10 stars.".

I enjoy watching this as a double bill with SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER there are strong similarities between the two.  The scenes are shot with a lot of earnestness and validity.  I find it ironically saddening that the man who played Rien Hans van Tongeren committed suicide in 1982 two years after he played this role at the young age of 28.  It's nice to know that Verhoeven has a gift with drama as he does with big action movies like ROBOCOP and BASIC INSTINCT.  If you have the means choose this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me insert a positive comment prior to my trashing one of the plots of the film I thought it was great the way the filmmakers handled the nudity and sex. I wasn't shocked by it but rather I found it to be natural and expected when it was shown. often I find that movies that shy away from showing sex use its absence to titillate for example the well placed prop or hand that blocks the view of genitals. such practices only serve to draw MORE attention to those body parts. In this film the casual nudity and sex only served to demystify themselves. It was no porno the point of the film was not sex. Sex was merely one of the vehicles from point A to B. Good work. I'll have to raise my rating to commend the makers for the groundbreaking WAY they told the story. Many films have offensive plots that never make this much of an impact.Now to my complaint about one of the film's plots A badly written movie that reminded me of Valet Girls and Angel 'High school honor student by day Hollywood hooker by night' not the Buffy spinoff without their humor. The writing was on level with the porn movies made at the time. Yes the porn writing at that time was in it's heyday but it was still bad writing. To focus on one of the most egregious part of the plot Even listening to the director's commentary didn't help explain the whole ridiculous and insulting gaysubplot. Ah so getting gangraped by a bunch of guys late one night will make you gay the next day. i wonder if that would work with lesbians? So maybe sexually repressed heterosexual women could be helped by gangrape? Once they get banged they'll realize that they like it will become sexually liberated and will show up at the rapist's house the next day for some snuggling as Eef did. A component of good writing is that even if the revelation about a character is surprising a viewer should be able to go back in the film and realize that it was foreseeable. In this movie there is nothing that Eef did that showed him to be gay any more than were his friends or the viewers. 1. the measurement scene it wasn't his idea it's not uncommon and if that means he's gay then his two friends are even more gay. 2. The gaybashing scene even if it was his idea his friends and their girlfriends were at least if not more brutal than he was. 3. Failing to get erect for his girlfriend as he said he was drunk I'm sure this has affected most of the film's viewers at one time or another and from the dialog it seemed as if it had never been a problem before. In fact the other couple also had a problem that prevented them from having sex. 4. Watching the gay sex scene yes he watched it briefly but immediately his idea was not to relieve himself sexually. Instead his immediate idea was to use it to make money to win the favor of the girl. If watching three seconds of that scene makes him gay it makes everyone of the viewers who watched it gay as well. 5. Does a twenty year old really living in Rotterdam in the 80s need to be reminded that homosexuality is an option? There is porn of every variety on every newsstand in that country. Legalized prostitutes have delineated districts. If he wanted to have gay sex he probably would have by this point.".

Verhoeven's script cowritten with his regular collaborator Gerard Soeteman tackles hotbutton issues like sex disability religious faith and homosexuality in an upfront manner leading some Dutch critics to berate the film's alleged 'misogyny' and 'homophobia' similar accusations were levelled against some of Verhoeven's Hollywood features including BASIC INSTINCT and SHOWGIRLS but these complaints become diminished under scrutiny True Soutendijk's heartbreaker is little more than an avaricious trollop but she's the only one who remains loyal to van Tongeren in the wake of a devastating accident which changes his life forever. It's also true that Agterberg is driven out of the closet by a vicious sexual assault which occurs late in the film but this episode represents his passage into adulthood giving him the courage to confront his demons including his brutal ultrareligious father.Beautifully filmed and acted with conviction by a sterling cast there are extended cameos from Verhoeven regulars Jeroen Krabb and Rutger Hauer the movie benefits from an extraordinary sexual candor light years removed from the cowardly Rrated rubbish flooding international cinemas at the time PORKY'S MEATBALLS etc.. And though the sexual imagery here is only fleeting it's also remarkably potent and the actors are to be commended for their bravery. Sadly van Tongeren  a hugely talented actor with a bright future in international cinema  committed suicide two years after the film was completed.NB.

Verhoeven didn't direct a bad movie in the 80s which is something very few American directors can say truthfully. Even David Lynch gave us 'Dune' during this period. 'Spetters' is much tougher and confronting than you'd expect from scanning the basic plot line  three young horny guys pursue their dreams which centre around motorcross. That's what makes this movie so surprising and memorable. Verhoeven regulars Rutger Hauer and Jeroen Krabbe pop up in quite good cameos but the movie is carried by the three young unknown to international audiences male leads. All are well cast and impressive. As is the foxy Renee Soutendijk who would go on to play a major part in Verhoeven's next movie the brilliant erotic thriller 'The Fourth Man'. 'Spetters' is raw and unpolished compared to many of Verhoeven's subsequent movies but is definitely worth watching.

A honest to goodness art film Spetters lacks the attention it should receive and is well worth the rent or purchase is one is actually able to find a copy.and don't be thrown off if it is the director's cut but just fastforward the yucky scenes. You don't miss much at all.";

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing Pi you realise that a lot of Hollywood producers should be automatically fired. Why? Because you can make a great film like this for only 60000 whereas turkeys like Waterworld cast tens of millions of dollars. Go figure.Pi is about the obsession of maths genius Max Cohen Sean Gullette trying to find a number a mathematical connection that underlies all things but particularly the stock market. His obsession however begins to drive him nuts with constant headaches and paranoid delusions or are they....What's most striking about this movie is it's different. It isn't really comparable to any other movie I know in terms of plot or of style. Aronofsky shows an incredible ability to work with a budget and yet still produce a visually striking movie  the movie doesn't suffer from being shot in fuzzy black  white. The paranoia of the man character is enhanced greatly by the use of a snorricam  a camera mounted to the body so that the viewer is attached to Max as he walks. Sharp extremely kinetic cuts add to the frenetic energy and display what we would later see in Requiem for a Dream. The whole intense brooding nature is helped by the black  white imagery never allowing for any colour to seep through enhanced by the fuzzy dreamlike quality of the movie that reflects Cohen's delusions. It's no wonder that Aronofsky came away from Sundance as the Best Director for his amazing work here with such limited means.The plot is interesting but the number Cohen seeks which is not Pi  Pi is just used because it is a universal invariant like that which Cohen wants isn't the centre of the movie. It's about obsession and how as Max's friend points out it can drive you to see things everywhere. Sure there are technical inaccuracies in it but it's played with an assured sense of conviction ably acted by unknown Gullette.Pi is very interesting because it stands far out from the crowd. It's not one for those who think Pearl Harbour is the way films should be made  it's too different for that. A great debut for a director who went on to surpass this with his superb next project Requiem for a Dream. 910.".

Like many others it was Requiem that made me find Pi. It took Aronofsky only 2 movies to become one of my favorite directors and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this young and promising writerdirector.The movie stars Sean Gullette which cowrote the movie with Aronofsky and Eric Watson. You might recognize him as Arnold Marion's old partner and shrink in Requiem. Gullette is perfect in his role and does an amazing job here. It's a shame we don't see his talent in more movies.Mark Margolis Mr. Rabinowitz in Requiem is excellent as Max's mentor and all the other cast is doing a great job too.Like in Requiem technical aspect is topnotch Excellent blackandwhite cinematography Matthew Libatique and the innovative use of the Snorricam lightning editing Oren Sarch and music Clint Mansell frontman for Pop will Eat itself.The director's commentary for this movie is fascinating. After hearing it you'd appreciate the effort and heart that were put into this movie a lot more.Look for guestcameo appearances by Samia Shoaib the nurse in Requiem as Devi Max's nextdoor neighbor Clint Mansell the movie's composer as the photographer and Abraham Aronofsky Darren's father as one of the men delivering the suitcase at the door.One last word. While some aspects presented in the movie  such as the Hebrew numerology and mathematical concepts  are correct that is the explanations of Hebrew numerology are not madeup That doesn't mean I actually believe in any of the meanings attached to them I suggest you to use your suspensionofdisbelief instead of trying to find logic and mistakes in them.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Now here'a film that is not for all tastes as the clich goes.Strange doesn't quite cover it but it is not that bizarre that you can't figure out what's happening. Directorwriter Darren Arokofsky made a name for himself with his second movie Requiem For A Dream and this was the young filmmakers' first effort. It was made a tight budget since he was an unknown but that's part of the attraction. This is grainy blackandwhite and so is the gritty story and most of the characters. The unique look fits the story.It's not a story that is going to please a lot of people  an almostdemented math wizard trying to figure out stock market codes and two groups hounding him trying to cash in on his brainpower. One is trying to use him to make big money in the market and the other is trying to decipher ancient Jewish texts and thinks our mathematician can help. Meanwhile he wants no part of any of these people.Our hero the numbers freak thinks the entire world revolves around numbers.

	onyx:emotionText "Now here'a film that is not for all tastes as the clich goes.Strange doesn't quite cover it but it is not that bizarre that you can't figure out what's happening. Directorwriter Darren Arokofsky made a name for himself with his second movie Requiem For A Dream and this was the young filmmakers' first effort. It was made a tight budget since he was an unknown but that's part of the attraction. This is grainy blackandwhite and so is the gritty story and most of the characters. The unique look fits the story.It's not a story that is going to please a lot of people  an almostdemented math wizard trying to figure out stock market codes and two groups hounding him trying to cash in on his brainpower. One is trying to use him to make big money in the market and the other is trying to decipher ancient Jewish texts and thinks our mathematician can help. Meanwhile he wants no part of any of these people.Our hero the numbers freak thinks the entire world revolves around numbers. Everything in the universe he thinks can be figured out through number codes. Not only is he wacked and paranoid but so is about everyone in here. They all have strange ideas. Innovative camerawork makes the story even stranger.

Aranovsky's use of a haunting yet modern score binds the movie together perfectly aided by some fantastic cinematic techniques that disorientate the audience in time with the music. The character narration is also a great cohesive tool with the deadpan delivery more than matching the tone of the piece. This film is not as beautiful as Requiem nor does it have quite the same gutwrenching effect but nonetheless this is still some film.

	schema:reviewBody "Pi is the kind of movie I wished I could've seen in one of those dank arthouse movie theaters in New York City as it's practically giftwrapped for the crowds. But it's not done with every shot lingering on the characters soaking in minimalism in its black and white photography quite the opposite. Darren Aronofsky is a filmmaker I first got into through Requiem for a Dream which now years after I saw it I want to revisit again upon the soon to be released the Fountain and especially after now seeing Pi. Before with 'Requiem' I did like the movie a lot but felt a little apprehensive about deeming it that old term 'masterpiece' as the editing while ultra fast for a purpose almost came off as too MTV for me. But years later after hundreds of more films taken in I'm ready for a second look. In this particular case Pi is also the kind of movie that warrants a second look at the director's other films. His themes run just as much together as does his breakneck style. And it's not just to show off he truly does get inside a psychology through subjective camera AND editing to a degree that might impress Hitchcock albeit with some whiplash.Max Cohen played by Sean Gullette is the protagonist of the story who's main foe is none other than the universe itself in a sense all through one number. Or rather a series of numbers one which might unlock the Stock Market secret for him. He doesn't even want to play the market mind you but the point for him if one can follow might be attributed to a repeated memory he has of looking at the sun as a boy and soon looking past the shock of actually looking long at it. This is a very small device by Aronofsky but it works well to establish and continue this man's downward spiral. And spirals by the way seem to also figure into the film as well as a secret technology firm with a woman who reminded me of Condaleeza Rice lookalike and especially a near undercover Hasidim ring where they need the numbers in Cohen's head to unlock some big secret to God. But even with all of this pressure Cohen can't shake what's dogging him around in his own cramped wireridden apartment with many bugs crawling around.The key for this movie really is atmosphere in the acting if it makes you uncomfortable sometimes that's the point too and it's probably the strangest performance of a lifetime for Gullette the production design that apartment and the subways the grainy spectacular photography by Matthew Libatique the editing to be sure which here unlike the breakneck 'Requiem' does take a break from the cuts so quick they almost past subliminally which isn't bad and the moody music that is so slight you almost forget its there. It even works for me and this is a big plus as someone who's not really interested in mathematics worst subject in school and even better as it drew me in to his obsessions with it. I really liked one of the early scenes between Max and his the friendly Hassidic man who explains on paper different numbers and their relation to parts of the Torah. And in the end it all comes down to getting engrossed through what the filmmaker's bringing in with this man. There is a sort of detachment from reality that most of us would never touch much of this with a ten foot pole but then again it really isn't. Aronofsky also makes a point of some hallucinationsdreams adding to the ambiance skidding almost towards the pretentious and thus creating a world all of its own in Pi for Max and for us as well.A film that I shall certainly seek out again when I can if only to see if I can understand some things a little more or maybe not as case might be and to see such a powerhouse performance from Gullette. Grade A".

Overflowing with intensity and hyperkinetic camerawork this is a frightening rollercoaster ride of a film despite clocking in at less than 90 minutes Pi is by no means short on resonance  but rather leaves a heavy feeling of exuberance and fascination with the material that lasts long after it's finished. At the same time though people who aren't as openminded to more obscure abstract films like this would be I think surprised. This is not as complicated or bewildering a film as I had expected. If one can be able to focus intently on the story the result is rewarding and doesn't provide for much headscratching. Its style seems rather modern rather hip...at times it reminded me of The Matrix which ironically was released the FOLLOWING year what with its slick techno musical score and its flashy opening credits.To shy away from this film simply because of its math content is to be completely shallow and ignorant. The way it handles the material is a whole lot more interesting than you'd probably think. Like A Beautiful Mind Pi is an instant classic that serves to reawaken my erratic interests in my poorest subject mathematics. It's original it's interesting and above all  genius.".

One would think that there was no way that this could hold anyone's interest but they managed to pull it off.  Pi reminds us that genius is just this side of madness and that great intelligence is a burden as well as a gift.Gullette plays Max Cohen the brilliant and tortured mathematician beautifully and without overacting.  His mind seethes with the possibilities that lie waiting inside number systems.  However the strain that his talent places on him results in blinding hallucinogenic migraines.  The scenes where Max falls victim to his ailment are tense welldirected and have just the right amount of creepiness.The one beef that I have with this picture pertains to the other characters who are meant to be the film's antagonists.  Two parties  a Wall Street firm and a Hasidic Jewish sect are after Max for his abilities.  Neither of these relationships are expanded on enough to make the viewer care about them.  Of the two the sect members are the most believable.  However the stockbrokers and Max's encounters with them scream film school.  The loudmouthed and overbearing businesswoman is more a parody of the suits and doesn't fit in with the rest of the film.  You are left thinking that the only reason these characters appeared at all was as a plot device to get Max the parts he needed.A minor but nagging point  are we really to believe in this day and age where nearly everyone has seen the inside of a PC that Max's superprocessor is a black cube with four pins?  I saw this film with a bunch of other techietype folk and our collective reaction was he's going to run his calculations on a bridge rectifier?All in all this film is entertaining for those who enjoy offbeat cinema. Those looking for The Matrix aren't going to be satisfied at all.  Math science and computer geeks won't wince too much.  Hollywood SFX blockbuster this isn't but that's not a bad thing.  Overall a good film with a few minor drawbacks.".

I saw this film with a bunch of other techietype folk and our collective reaction was he's going to run his calculations on a bridge rectifier?All in all this film is entertaining for those who enjoy offbeat cinema. Those looking for The Matrix aren't going to be satisfied at all.  Math science and computer geeks won't wince too much.  Hollywood SFX blockbuster this isn't but that's not a bad thing.  Overall a good film with a few minor drawbacks.";

All life in the universe is subjected to patterns and that nothing is just random but based on a series of  formulas calculations patterns and that if this is true the market has one.

The story is clever it plays on paranoia and delusion  in fact it may or may not happen.  Even at the end of the film I was left wondering if Max was a genius or if he was a nutter and all this was in his mind.  The film uses this paranoia to create some good scenes and the thumping base music ups the ante a bit.It's not an easy film to enjoy in the traditional sense but it is an experience.  The subject matter is different enough to be interesting and the telling is clever  I for one can't wait to see what the director does with Batman year one it certainly won't be a camp Joel Schumacher film anyway!Gullette who also cowrote is good in the lead and is totally convincing. Mark Margolis is also good and it's good to see him in different roles I know him from his strong role in Oz although he's not as good here.  The rest of the cast are good  but really the star here is the director as he manages to put us in Max's mind and involve us in the paranoia so thoroughly that we're not sure what is real and what isn't.Overall this isn't as masterly as the hype suggests but it's different enough and compelling enough to be more than gripping for 90 minutes.".

I found it on Netflix streaming movies.Overall it is a big disappointment for me. Sean Gullette is the central character Max Cohen a New York nonreligious Jew who is also a mathematics genius.

Some time later as the bandages were removed he began slowly to see light again. And he also started having headaches. All this presumably contributed to his math genius and his borderline madness.The meat of the story comes when he is using his computer at home and it spits out a long string of numbers perhaps 200 or so maybe a bit more. Then in a chance meeting with a Hasidic Jew learns that there is a rumor that a mysterious 216digit number matched to symbols in the Torah spells out the name of God. So Max begins to wonder if somehow his computer had spit out that number now on a paper he had discarded.So we follow Max as he gets confused or angry and yells at everyone around. Followed by a woman who wants his codes for predicting the stock market. All in all not a very satisfying viewing for me.One thing fun was seeing veteran actor Mark Margolis as Max's former graduate adviser Sol Robeson. Margolis had a key role in the TV series Breaking Bad as the wheelchair bound and mute member of the Mexican drug lord family.".

Sure it's cheap but Aronofsky managed to get past this by using black  white and deliberately making the print very grainygiving it a wonderfully surreal look. I am not exactly sure how he did this but it worked well. And because he wasn't able to use top equipment it has a bit of a homemade lookwhich I was able to look past. Much of this was because the plot was so wild and surreal as well as very stylish.Describing the plot...well that's even MORE difficult! It's a strange tale about a man who is on the edge of losing his mind. He is convinced that everything in nature and life can be quantified and explained through mathematics. And given that you can find the correct mathematical formula you can predict and understand EVERYTHING. So Maximillian spends nearly every second of his waking day devoted to this allencompassing task. He avoids relationships is very unkempt and is a miserable excuse for a human being. And eventually it all begins to take its toll as he begins to hallucinate and experiencing excruciating pain in his body and brain. What's next for this incredibly strange man with his seemingly impossible task? See the film! This is a very very difficult film to rate. It gets very high marks for originality and it is entertaining. However it's NOT a film for the mainstream. The average Joe would probably find it all just too weird and too confusing.

Pi however sticks to the rogue scientist image embodied in the loner mathematician Max Cohen. Its modernization seems to be limited to technological aspects there's a lot of technobabble about patterns in the number Pi computers becoming sentient etc. All good natured fun in Star Trek but the seriousness with which it is brought in Pi made its inaccuracy really annoying. Perhaps the movie's makers should have used Shelley's approach to avoid embarrasing themselves just mention all that technology is dangerous and you don't want to talk about it to avoid corrupting the readerviewer. But then again what would have been left in this movie? Nothing much I'm afraid Max doesn't seem to be a very interesting character his relationship or lack thereof with his female neighbour is only briefly touched upon etc. Overall Pi is repetitious contains too many scenes of Max just vomitingbanging his head into something... and is just plain boring.".

This is so silly I don't even know how to say it.  There are so many fevered dream type sequences that they lose any impact their dynamic visual style gives them by the end of the film.  I was not surprised to see that older voters on IMDB have not rated this film so highly  they have seen enough movies with quality and substance to know when the director's just putting a mickey over on the audience.  Most older people also appreciate it when a movie actually has a story.  This movie was made to impress a bunch of people who never understood any math in the first place but would love to believe they did.  For those who have studied esoteric mathematics this movie is an insult to our intelligence.  A java drama with no heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of the monk that rose through Russia's hierarchy to become arguably more powerful than the Tsar and Tsarina seems to me anyway to be a rather strange choice of film for Hammer to take on. Of course there are definite horror elements in the tale but of all the stories in the world this one is a rather odd choice in spite of this. However Hammer are known for being innovative and doing things that most studios wouldn't even dream of and I for one am very glad they did do a take on this tale as it's actually a very good film. As you might expect the film follows the story of Grigori Rasputin a Russian monk with the power to heal. However Rasputin is also a blasphemer and the film follows his tribulations after he is thrown out of the monetary as he drinks sleeps and hypnotises his way across Russia until he eventually falls in with Sonia lady in waiting to the Tsarina. The rest as they say is history. Well sort of.As you might expect the film isn't very historically accurate and Don Sharp appears to be more keen to focus on Rasputin himself than his place in history which is no bad thing in my opinion as it makes for better horror. This film is a very different kind of horror to what we're used to from Hammer as it's very character based and doesn't rely on blood and monsters to tell its story. Now don't get me wrong I like blood and monsters as much as the next Hammer fan but this film is a welcome departure in my opinion. The history surrounding Rasputin SOME of which is shown in the film is actually quite scary how a blaspheming crazy monk can rise through Russia's hierarchy like he did is surreal and is made more so by the fact that it is actually true. The excellent Christopher Lee brings the monk himself to life. Who else but Christopher Lee could have played Rasputin? I wager that nobody else could have and Lee is awesome in this role. His screen presence and charisma combine with what we expect Rasputin would have been like to great effect and although this is a campy horror film and cant really be taken seriously as a historical study I think Lee has captured the essence of Russia's finest love machine to a tee and I doubt it will ever be done to the same standard again.".

Well sort of.As you might expect the film isn't very historically accurate and Don Sharp appears to be more keen to focus on Rasputin himself than his place in history which is no bad thing in my opinion as it makes for better horror. This film is a very different kind of horror to what we're used to from Hammer as it's very character based and doesn't rely on blood and monsters to tell its story. Now don't get me wrong I like blood and monsters as much as the next Hammer fan but this film is a welcome departure in my opinion. The history surrounding Rasputin SOME of which is shown in the film is actually quite scary how a blaspheming crazy monk can rise through Russia's hierarchy like he did is surreal and is made more so by the fact that it is actually true. The excellent Christopher Lee brings the monk himself to life. Who else but Christopher Lee could have played Rasputin? I wager that nobody else could have and Lee is awesome in this role. His screen presence and charisma combine with what we expect Rasputin would have been like to great effect and although this is a campy horror film and cant really be taken seriously as a historical study I think Lee has captured the essence of Russia's finest love machine to a tee and I doubt it will ever be done to the same standard again.";

	schema:reviewBody "In case you're anxious to find out more about the TRUE story of Rasputin you better search for some lame books in a library or attend classes given by nearly dead history teachers as accuracy isn't exactly this film's biggest trump! However if you're hoping to see an exciting and atmospheric adventure this Hammer highlight is highly recommended! It's one of the rather few movies centering on Russia's most infamous history icon Grigori Rasputin. The story especially focuses on his persona and not exactly on his place in history. Rasputin is a barbaric and womanizing drunkard but gifted with astonishing healing powers and hypnotizing skills. When the monastery doesn't put up with his vile and aggressive actions any longer he travels to St. Petersburg where he works himself all the way up into the Tsarfamily through manipulation of servants and innocent women. The film uses good looking set pieces and costumes but naturally it wouldn't be half as memorable if it weren't for Christopher Lee. Our legendary horror vet gives away one of the most energetic performances in horrorhistory and he really does look terrifying! It seemed to me that Lee was happy for not wearing his Dracula outfit for a change and this definitely reflects in his great acting. The tension and eeriness in 'Rasputin The Mad Monk entirely relies on Lee's charisma grimaces and rude voice. The supportive cast is more than decent with familiar names like Barbara Shelley Dracula Prince of Darkness Quartermass and the Pit Susan Farmer Die Monster Die and Richard Pasco The Gorgon as Rasputin's petrified opponents. Don Sharp once again does a solid directing job and I wish to stress again that he's a vastly underrated filmmaker. Sharp has made some really good genre movies that remain undiscovered to this date like Dark Places Psychomania and Kiss of the Vampire.".

It's to be expected that for the sake of a good show that films such as this will play fast and loose with the facts. However it must be said that this IS a damn good show. Lee is allowed the chance to really cut loose for once and he does a marvelous job of going over the top as the lusty lifeoftheparty Rasputin who has genuine healing abilities but also a very conniving and selfserving nature. After gaining some attention for curing a sick woman he soon finds a means of manipulating his way into the royal family of early 20th century Czarist Russia. Naturally there are those who aren't fooled by him and will seek to destroy him once they have the chance. The Hammer studio does an immaculate job as always in recreating the sights and sounds of a period piece. Top talents such as production designer Bernard Robinson and supervising editor James Needs are at the top of their game. Don Banks composed the very unsubtle thunderous music score which does come in handy when Rasputin is required to make an entrance. The excellent cast includes beautiful Barbara Shelley and Suzan Farmer Francis Matthews Dinsdale Landen Renee Asherson Derek Francis and Joss Ackland other than Lee the performer that really stands out is Richard Pasco as Dr. Bruno Zargo an alcoholic who becomes putty in the hands of the mad Rasputin. Lee himself is a delight his rich voice booming with authority. He simply commands the screen and keeps the right insane evil glint in his eyes at all times. The most entertaining of all the scenes is one in which a furious Landen unthinkingly rushes into a confrontation with Lee only to find himself outmatched. The final battle is an exciting one with Rasputin proving to be exceedingly difficult to finish off. Overall this isn't top drawer Hammer but it's still quite enjoyable and worth a viewing for fans of the studio and star. Seven out of 10.".

Seeing Lee playing something other then Count Dracula was nice to see but I also couldn't help but notice the similarities.The story is about Gregori Rasputin a monk who was exiled by the church for being a drunk and a womanizer. He has great powers which he uses in benevolent acts like healing people but also uses them for evil things like taking over Russia! In this Hammer film we see Rasputing slowly working his way up the social ladder by using his mind controlling powers on certain key individuals who will no doubt help him become more prominent and powerful.The strength of this film no doubt lies in Lees performance. His incredibly evil and selfish Rasputin is a memorable performance by Lee and one that will be enjoyed very much by Lee and Hammer fans alike. Hey he is a Monk who escapes to the local pub to drink and get it on! Here we see Lee actually engage in conversations! Here we see Lee dancing! Here we see Lee going after the chicks! Drinking and getting drunk like a skunk! Lee obviously had a ball breaking away from playing the ever classy and quiet Count Dracula and it shows.On the downside the film is kind of low on production values. You can tell when a Hammer film is cheap because usually the action takes place in one or two rooms. And the action doesn't go anywhere else. Here from what I could read on the film they used the sets from Dracula Prince of Darkness and you can tell this specially when you see the outside of the Czars castle. It has a strange resemblance to Draculas castle in Prince of Darkness.But putting that aside the main fun here is watching Lees Rasputin being evil. No matter how historically inaccurate this film might be its great to see Rasputin use his powers to lure women to bed to kill anyone who will get in his way in his quest for power. This movie is not a history lesson its a Hammer film! And Hammer is good at being sleazy and fun. Hammer just took the basic idea of Rasputin and some minor historical details and made a fun flick out of it.All in all it was a fun film with some budgetary limitations. Still that didn't stop it from being a lot of fun. Specially by watching Lee devour the screen being so evil. I've seen a few Hammer duds and this ain't one of them.Rating 35".

You can imagine my delight when I was gifted the Hammer DVD Collection for Christmas which consists of 21 films from the vault of the great British institution. I felt spoiled for choice. When opening the box I was greeted by the mad eyes of Christopher Lee gazing out from amongst a gigantic beard and El Topoesque haircut. I felt obliged to choose this as my introduction to what will no doubt become a fixation with Hammer and the film I will remember years into the future when I'm no doubt walking the Earth trying to find all the tiny forgotten films Hammer produced before they became famous.For those of you who don't know Grigori Rasputin was a reallife Russian mystichypnotistconartist who had a heavy influence on the Tsarist government of Emperor Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra after apparently healing their son Alexei as he lay dying from haemophilia. The film is less concerned with the politics of the time and instead focuses on Rasputin's love for drinking women and generally being a bit of a bastard as he hypnotises and heals his way through society and into the bed of ladyinwaiting Sonia Barbara Shelley.The film wastes no time introducing Rasputin's maverick attitudes to monkhood as he heals a saloon owner's wife on her death bed so he can get served a drink and proceeds to sing and drink the night way before hacking a man's hand off in a fight. Fleeing to Moscow after being hauled in front of the bishop for his unorthodox ways he gains influence over a disgraced doctor and begins to plan his rise to power.The film's main strength is undoubtedly Lee's performance as the mad Russian as he dominates every scene with his intense piercing eyes and booming voice with his towering frame overshadowing everyone that comes across his path. The scene in which he does a celebratory dance after beating a challenger in a drinking contest only to mistake some onlookers for laughing at him is both weird and intimidating as he demands an apology. It is a great mix of thespian presence and Gothic camp that makes the Hammer films and more notably Christopher Lee's performances for the studio that extra bit special.Rasputin The Mad Monk is a thoroughly enjoyable film anchored by Lee's performance and Hammer's usual beautiful Technicolour cinematography and is made all the better by leaving out the politics and concentrating on creating a memorable film character.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This depiction of Rasputin's life owes only slightly more to history than Dracula A.D. 1972 owes to the Bram Stoker novel. However it's enormous fun from start to finish! The liberties that it takes with history were likely influenced at least in part by the fact that Prince Felix Yusupov Rasputin's selfadmitted assassin was still alive in 1966  he died the next year  and was well known for being the plaintiff in Yusupov v. MGM in which he successfully sued the studio for invasion of privacy and libel as regards their 1932 film Rasputin and the Empress. Yusupov's role is taken by Ivan played by Francis Matthews who sadly died recently. As in The Revenge of Frankenstein and Dracula Prince of Darkness which was filmed backtoback with this film on many of the same sets he delivers a wonderful charismatic performance. He would have made a great James Bond. The film has a very strong supporting cast overall including Barbara Shelley Suzan Farmer Richard Pasco Dinsdale Landen Rene Anderson Derek Francis and Joss Ackland. Both Shelley and Farmer also appeared in Dracula Prince of Darkness. I thought that it was quite funny that the latter played Francis Matthews' wife in that film and his sister in this one! Her character is this film Vanessa is basically a standin for Yusupov's wife Princess Irina who was also still alive at the time as she died in 1970.The film more or less ignores the political developments in Russia in the dying days of the Tsars in favour of focussing on Rasputin's rise to prominence within the imperial court. While the Tsarina has a supporting role and Alexei appears briefly Tsar Nicholas II is neither seen nor mentioned perhaps uniquely for a film about Rasputin. Christopher Lee who met Yusupov as a child in the 1920s clearly relishes the role of Rasputin. Even discounting the myths suppositions lies and exaggeration which have grown up around him over the last century he was still a larger than life figure and Lee plays him as such. In stark contrast to the Dracula films Lee appears in almost every scene and has by far the most screen time and dialogue while Ivan the hero of the piece has comparatively little screen time. He is brilliant and intense as Rasputin who makes for a very compelling character. Rasputin is very different from Dracula in terms of his loud boorish behaviour but parts of his modus operandi are the same as he successfully gains control of several women using hypnosis. While for the first hour of the film could be described as a pseudohistorical thriller it becomes a full blown horror film in the last half an hour when Rasputin hypnotises Sonia played wonderfully by Barbara Shelley into committing suicide and then torments her brother Peter from the darkness before throwing acid in his face severely disfiguring and ultimately killing him. The depiction of Rasputin's death again quite scary is loosely based on Yusupov's description thereof given that he survives ingesting poisoned food and drink before being killed outright but the precise circumstances are altered. In any event some historians believe that Yusupov may have been less than honest in his description.If you're looking for an accurate depiction of Rasputin and his role in the Russian imperial court this isn't the film for you. However if you're looking an extremely fun and occasionally extremely scary pseudohistorical Gothic horror film with a wonderful performance from Christopher Lee then this should be right up your alley.".

Christopher Lee brings the character to life as a wildeyed filthy miscreant with an insatiable lust and otherworldly powers. Make no mistake Lee is the whole show here. When he's not around the movie feels like a stuffy British costume drama. But luckily for us that's not often. Lee hams it up gloriously. It's one of his most memorable roles. It's not a horror movie although there are elements that resemble one. Being that it's from Hammer there are also pretty women like Barbara Shelley and Suzan Farmer. The sets and costumes are nice. Don't look to this or any movie for a history lesson. It's a fun piece of entertainment that just happens to be based on real people and events. Even if you don't normally like Hammer films or historical biopics you should be able to enjoy this.".

Christopher Lee brings the character to life as a wildeyed filthy miscreant with an insatiable lust and otherworldly powers. Make no mistake Lee is the whole show here. When he's not around the movie feels like a stuffy British costume drama. But luckily for us that's not often. Lee hams it up gloriously. It's one of his most memorable roles. It's not a horror movie although there are elements that resemble one. Being that it's from Hammer there are also pretty women like Barbara Shelley and Suzan Farmer. The sets and costumes are nice. Don't look to this or any movie for a history lesson. It's a fun piece of entertainment that just happens to be based on real people and events. Even if you don't normally like Hammer films or historical biopics you should be able to enjoy this.";

This movie shows how The Mad Monk used unexplainable evil powers to garner or demand influence and manipulate anyone of his choosing. Rasputin also saw himself having a physical prowess with women and even eased entry to the court of the czar. My favorite scene is the sequence leading to his assassination but how was this head strong character so easily duped. Remember this film forgoes accuracy in favor of entertainment.

The plot plays heavily on his nightly antics of song dance women and wine almost making him a drinking buddy on occasions. But don't be fooled. All along he's made designs on the Tsar's house carefully toying with different individuals to reach different goals and when those persons have been wrung out of all their usefulness he sends them off to destroy themselves.There was an extended fight scene at the end that was severely cut and I can only guess at its contents. I had heard that in reality Rasputin had been remarkably hard to kill and methods such as poison stabbing shooting clubbing and hanging were all employed to send him on his way.Lee is excellent in this role and he's surrounded by an equally good cast. Boris was the second best character in the film. The best images of Lee are when he's womanizing or laying in bed in his bedclothes and boots smoking a cigarette and roughing it up with little Sonia. Perhaps the best part is where you barely see him when Peter goes to confront Rasputin about Sonia's fate. You can hear the ominous voice booming through the chteau as Lee stalks the doorways in darkness luring little Peter into the laboratory. Be careful Peter there's acid in there.".

I love Hammer the good thing about English studios is you knew what you were getting there's quality control of sorts. The look of a Hammer is of a kind it's not sumptuous or chic but has a chintzy allure like a boarding house or Indian restaurant of the 1970s. The plain narrative grips you these days it would be all noise and smoke and blue lighting overshadowing the respected actors. That said after the bravaura first half hour the plot unfolds in a predictable way as Rasputin wins the confidence of the Tsar's family as expected with nary a setback. It goes against the Hammer formula in that usually you have a group of folk in a strange castle getting the willies you can't go wrong with this or it's from the pov of the doctor in Frankenstein as he goes a bit crazy and alienates the locals. Here it's all from Rasputin's pov and we know he's a bad guy so what gives. Dramatically it's a bit dead in parts and while the sets are good there are few actors in it it gets a bit claustrophobic. The Queen's court for instance seems to be made up of only three people. And we never see the Tsar at all. There's a missing element here. It should be all about the impact Rasputin is making on the court but really it's just him and about three others.".

Just as his triumph seems assured he is humiliated by a sex scandal engineered by his most powerful enemy in the Senate...Let it be stated immediately that George Arliss should have been the worst possible actor to portray the title figure in this film. First he was much too old Hamilton was in his 30's at the time of the scandal Arliss turned 63 in 1931. Also the handsome Hamilton in no way resembled Arliss who quite frankly looks like a death'shead.But this is not supposed to be a physical reconstruction of the historical Hamilton but rather a look into the heart  character of the fellow. In this Arliss succeeds admirably using his tremendous acting talents to both inform  entertain us. Truly he was one of the great cinematic artists of his generation and it is a shame that he is all but forgotten today.Although all centers around Arliss the rest of the cast does well Doris Kenyon  June Collyer as the very different women in Hamilton's life Dudley Digges  Ralf Harolde as his enemies Montague Love as Thomas Jefferson and old Lionel Belmore stealing a few scenes as Hamilton's corpulent fatherinlaw. Special mention should be made of Alan Mowbray very effective as George Washington.Nonpolitical potential viewers who avoid this film risk missing a superb performance by one of the past masters.".

Even though we now know that Hamilton was a knowing and frequent philanderer this movie sets him up as a victim who would never have strayed had he not been the victim of a plot by his enemies. The conceit of making up a Senator Roberts who sets up the plot to bring Hamilton and the Assumption Bill down is such an outlandish whitewash. But there is a good bit of real history in the movie that you simply don't expect. Making the Assumption Bill into something dramatic this bill would have the federal government assume the debts of the states especially those owed to vets of the Revolution is a masterstroke. Who would believe that you could make drama out of the deal to trade Hamilton's desire to create a national bank with southerners' desire to have a capital on the Potomac.It's an intellectual drama with a focus on Hamilton as an honorable man and a great treasury secretary. Probably the only treasury secretary to have a movie made about him. It's so stilted but very dramatic and somewhat true. For comic relief they threw in a shufflin' and jivin' black servant so it's also funny and somewhat offensive. But it moves along and you won't get bored. A must for history buffs.".

In that sense he was completely wrong for the part. But who cared? The function of the movie was in part to give him a chance to display to a movie audience the acting talent that had made him so famous in the theater for so long. And that he does. Everything revolves around him. You may not like his acting  it seems very oldfashioned today  but you can't deny that he is acting.And then there is the finale when Hamilton sacrifices his own domestic happiness for the good of the fledgling nation revealing his dalliance with another woman to the public rather than let false accusations destroy his attempt to establish the credit of the United States on the world market. Filmed in 1931 when the U.S. was at the bottom of the Depression the moral was very clear politicians had to sacrifice themselves and their parties to the nation so that the nation could survive. Arliss' last speech promises that if you do so there will be prosperity ahead. Though it's a year early he could be mistaken for FDR.No this movie is not historically accurate. It was not trying to be a PBS documentary. It was designed to showcase Arliss' acting talent and to teach the nation a political lesson. It certainly did the former. To what extent it succeeded in doing the latter depends on how you read Congressional history for the next ten years.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the first years of sound George Arliss was Warner Brothers featured answer to what Jack Warner saw as class films for the studio biographical films. Later on Paul Muni fulfilled the same function.One of the worst maybe the worst of the ones he did was Alexander Hamilton. In this film we have the 63 year old Arliss playing the 30 something Hamilton in a play where his financial assumption plan and the eventual selection of a southern capital got interposed with America's first sex scandal Hamilton's affair with Maria Reynolds.Historians will be aghast at this screenplay but even more aghast at the casting of Arliss as Hamilton next to younger actors like Montagu Love as Thomas Jefferson and an even younger Alan Mowbray as George Washington.After a brief prologue with Washington and Hamilton at the end of the Revolutionary War where Hamilton expounds on his nationalist views the action fast forwards to the early 1790s and the first Washington term as president. Arliss is trying to push his financial plan for the federal government to assume all state debts to put the new United States of America on a sound financial basis. Love and his supporters which include a completely fictional character a Senator Timothy Roberts played by Duddley Digges see the idea as a power grab. They want the capital relocated to somewhere in the southern states.Digges wants more than that. He offers to swing votes Hamilton's way in order to get a plum ambassadorship to gay Paree in the midst of its own revolutionary problems. Arliss is mortified by the offer and flat turns him down. Digges vows revenge.The revenge comes in petticoats in the person of June Collyer as Maria Reynolds. Her husband encourages the affair with Hamilton and then seeks to blackmail him. Of course Hamilton is vulnerable in this way because his dear wife Elizabeth has had to visit her sister Angelica in Paris. Elizabeth is played by Daisy Kenyon.The only thing this travesty got right was Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton's total devotion to her man. Hamilton however never missed an opportunity for a long affair or quick roll in the hay in his life. Including that unseen sister Angelica who also at a different time was involved with Thomas Jefferson.The worst thing about Alexander Hamilton however was the casting. Arliss was a coauthor of the play this movie is based on and I'll bet it was a role he did on stage many times. The key here is that Hamilton had an active libido but it was a young man's libido and that Washington was a father figure for him. Hamilton was of illegitimate birth and rose from poverty a fact he never forgot. The last thing he was would have been a lonely guy pining for his wife who was away over the seas. Hamilton was at times brilliant loyal arrogant all in the same person. Not the wizened old fox we see. In real life Hamilton was 49 when he died years later in that duel with Aaron Burr. His assumption plan and the deal for the capital was struck much before the Reynolds affair.A great deal is made of Hamilton's honesty and in financial matters he was scrupulously honest. In real life his choice of subordinates was not always the best. His first Under Secretary of the Treasury had to resign because he was caught speculating in those bond obligations Hamilton wanted the federal government to assume. It was the first insider trading scandal in American history. Hamilton took quite a few hits from that one also from Jefferson etc.A cast of classically trained players do a decent job in bringing this historical travesty to the screen. Make no mistake you are NOT seeing anything resembling the real Alexander Hamilton though.".

Arliss was a major star on the stage and in the silent and the early talkie period with films like Disraeli 1921 and 1929 and Voltaire 1933. He won the Academy Award for Disraeli 1929 and was nominated again for The Green Goddess 1930. He seems strangely cast as young Hamilton given that Arliss was in his 60s playing a man in his 30s.Note that Arliss was so well regarded by Warner Bros. his name is even larger than the title of the film. Alan Mowbray 18961969 plays George Washington. He appeared in more than 140 films from 1931 to 1962. He had a recurring role in the Topper series and made memorable contributions to films such as The King and I 1956 The Man who Knew Too Much 1956 My Darling Clementine 1946 and Wagon Master 1950.Montagu Love 18771943 plays Thomas Jefferson. Love was a major star in the silent and early talkie period playing in more than 100 films. He's best known for supporting roles as the Bishop in Robin Hood 1938 Henry VIII in Prince and the Pauper 1937 and Zorro in The Mask of Zorro 1940.The film is directed by John Adolfi 18881933 a silent film director who made several films with Arliss. The film shows its stage origins.The film centers on where to locate the capital and how to finance the new government as well as Hamilton's indiscretion. But much of the dynamism of Hamilton's life his active libido his relationship with Washington his feud with Aaron Burr are missing.1931 was a great year for film. The top grossing films were Frankenstein Cimarron Mata Hari City Lights and Dracula. The Oscars went to Cimarron Picture The Champ Actor and Min and Bill Actress. Other notable films released that year include M Public Enemy Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde and Monkey Business. Any of these films hold up much better than this one.".

	schema:headline " How we missed having the city of Neropolis";
	schema:reviewBody "Henryk Sienkiewicz was one of Poland's great historical novelists and one of the first recipients of the Nobel Prize for literature 1905. It has only been in the last decade or so that translations of other novels by him have appeared in English but his major work QUO VADIS? has been known since it appeared over a century ago. It was a study of the early days of the Christians in Rome and their first persecution by the Emperor Nero 54  68 A.D. It concentrates on the burning of Rome and the persecution of the Christians including the death by crucifixion of St. Peter. So the background is identical to Cecil B. DeMille's THE SIGN OF THE CROSS. Inevitably comparisons between the two films their plots and the performances of the two Neros Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov result.But the two stories are not the same. Sienkiewicz threw in far more of the history of the Rome of that period than the author of the play THE SIGN OF THE CROSS did. And because of his deeply felt commitment to his faith Sienkiewicz showed the destruction of Nero's rotten regime and the first triumph of Christianity. THE SIGN OF THE CROSS does not do that  my comment there was that DeMille never made such a pessimistic and tragic film in his career with all the good people being destroyed and Nero at that time triumphant. This does not happen in QUO VADIS where the corruption and incompetence of the regime finally loses the support of the people and ... ironically worse ... the army!.There is also the addition of the leading poetcourtier of the day Petronius Arbiter. A man of wit and taste Petronius was one of several figures of literary note in Nero's court and one of several to meet tragedy by being near that egomaniac. The others were led by Nero's original chief minister Seneca the stoic philosopher and dramatist. Seneca's nephew Lucan was also a leading figure in the court. Both men were eventually turned into foes of the regime especially as Seneca fell from his ministerial position after the murder of Nero's mother Agrippina. Petronius managed to avoid the political conflict that involved the other two but the Emperor's irrational jealousy helped link the three. Lucan wrote a savage epic poem against the Imperial family PHARSALIA which signaled his rejection of the regime. Lucan joined a conspiracy against Nero led by a Senator named Piso. It was discovered and Lucan and Seneca implicated. Both were forced to commit suicide by opening their veins. Tigellinus Nero's leading adviser insinuated that Petronius was involved too he wasn't. Petronius also committed suicide the same way but wrote a witty and accurate denunciation to Nero which was given to the Emperor after the writer's death.Petronius' major surviving work THE SATYRICON was a wonderful look at the rot at the center of the regime of Nero. It by the way was turned into a film by Fellini in the late 1960s.Leo Genn brought Petronius and his delicate wit and taste out in the film and merited the Oscar nomination he got for this  his best remembered role aside from Dr. Kick in THE SNAKE PIT. Ustinov brings a degree of frailty to Nero  an uncertainty as to the acceptance of his public persona. He flails about between seeking the approval of the artists like Petronius and those who manipulate the tyrant in him Poppeia and Tigellinus. Despite his vicious evil one sympathizes with him  he is a sick man. And his reconstruction program he burns down old Rome to create Neropolis is on par to that of another tyrant of more recent vintage who planned to build a world capital called Germania over Berlin's bones. He too left many bones but it is hard to consider him at all sympathetic.As spectacle and history QUO VADIS? is quite rewarding. It may telescope the events of 64  68 A.D. when Nero committed suicide with assistance and avoid the three brief Emperors who ruled after Nero within the year Galba Otho and Vitellius before Vespasian came back from the war in Israel to take the throne for a decade  but it does show how Nero's regime collapsed. DeMille never tackled it. But despite those two omissions the film does do the period pretty well.Robert Taylor is more effective as a military commander  hero than Fredric March had been in SIGN OF THE CROSS. Deborah Kerr is more believable as an early Christian convert. And Finley Currie is wonderful as Simon Peter  who realizes that he must die for the Lord that he once denied. His end is based on a legend that Peter was crucified upside down supposedly at his request that he did not deserve to be crucified in the same way as the Lord he briefly failed. Altogether a superior religious  historic epic.".

	schema:reviewBody "At Last one of the great classic Hollywood blockbuster epics of the early fifties has finally found its rightful DVD home with this exceptional two disc release from Warner Home Video.Produced by Sam Zimbalist for MGM in 1951 and expertly directed by Mervin LeRoy Quo Vadis was Hollywood's first wallop in the fight against the onslaught of Television. Available at first and for many years only on VHS tape it then began to appear on a plethora of foreign DVDs but with varying quality it must be said. One such unfortunate issue which originated in Korea was released without any opening credits whatsoever! I kid you not! That said  we now thankfully have it in our possession and a superb issue it is! With perfect pristine colour resolution Robert Surtees' Acadamy Award nominated colour Cinematography comes across with well defined and plush imagery. The various cast members are attired in the most gorgeously coloured costumes. Particularly dazzling is the golden uniform worn by the picture's star Robert Taylor as he proudly bears himself aboard his golden chariot during his triumphal parade through Rome.Also here is Miklos Rozsa's outstanding Acadamy Award nominated score! His main Roman motif bold and strong dominates the scenes in the Forum and in the Arena. In gentler mode is his beautiful love theme for the scenes with the starcrossed lovers Marcus and Lygia. Then there's the frenetic bacchanallike Hymn of the Vestal Virgins followed immediately by the robust and heroic Triumphal March. Also heard on this issue  and for the first time since the original roadshow release 56 years ago  is the composer's Overture and Exit music. The great Rozsa would barely eclipse his Vadis music eight years later with his Oscar winning score for Ben Hur.The assembled cast are uniformly excellent except perhaps the syrupy and simpering characterization of Deborah Kerr as Lygia. But Robert Taylor is fine in what is probably his best known role as Nero's legion commander Marcus Vinicus. Outstanding is Leo Genn as Petronious  the sardonic and sarcastic confidante of the tyrannical Emperor Nero. And of course there is the wonderful Peter Ustinov chewing up every bit of scenery there is as the crazed and loony Nero. Both Ustinov and Genn were nominated for Acadamy Awards. The picture is also buoyed by some colourful and elaborate set pieces such as the Vestal Virgins singing and wildly dancing in homage to the goddess Vesta the spectacular triumphal parade of the Roman legions taking the salute from Nero as it passes the great palace the exciting chariot chase the brilliantly staged burning of Rome and the harrowing scenes in the Arena as the lions are released on the hapless hymnsinging Christians.These scenes all come across extremely well on this excellent DVD which comes with a trailer a splendid 45 minute featurette Quo Vadis And The Genesis of the Biblical Epic and a commentary by one F.X. Feeney who persists in calling the leading lady's character Leega instead of Lygia and neglects to tell us that the opening narration is spoken by MGM favourite Walter Pidgeon uncredited. However this is only a minor quibble and does nothing to diminish the greatness of this issue. Bravo Warner Home Video!!".

	schema:reviewBody "It is a great pleasure to see so many comments here that are enthusiastic about 'Quo Vadis'. I just saw it again last night after about 15 years and I marvelled at what a high quality spectacle it is  better than ever in fact.In his autobiography 'Take One' Mervyn LeRoy has some great stories about 'Quo Vadis'. Such as while filming one of the really big crowd scenes a voice pipes up from the extras 'Hey Moyvin!' and it's Jack Benny. And in a scene right out of one of his pictures when 'Quo Vadis' is screened in San Francisco and LeRoy is present the theatre happens to be right near the corner where the bigtime director once sold papers as a kid. He revisits the corner after the screening and sheds a few tears. LeRoy was an extra in C.B. DeMille's first 'Ten Commandments' so the desire to deliver something DeMillian was realized at last and with smashing success.We all agree on Peter Ustinov's ingenious performance so all I need to add is that in his own autobiography 'Dear Me' Sir Peter's recollections of the filming are as wonderful as his performance.Whatever his capabilities as an actor I always thought that Bob Taylor's performance was pretty darn good and appropriate too what highranking Roman officer wouldn't be pompous? In any case the story is much larger than Marcus' character and the story comes to dominate the picture.It is indeed a pity that the excellent Rozsa score wasn't handled by the Warners sound department where it would have been been presented to full effect Much of its impact is squandered by its being kept in the background. I don't think Merv LeRoy had so much to do with this decision as his alma mater was Warners try watching 'Anthony Adverse'! It seems that it was probably MGM policy. With sensitivity a DVD version could perhaps offer the picture with a 'sweetened' soundtrack.The quality of the camera work by solid professionals Bob Surtees later MGM's UltraPanavision 70 specialist and Wm V. Skall his work on 'The Silver Chalice' was outstanding really cannot be overstated.Along with the delights of Sir Peter's performance I still get choked up when noble Buddy Baer takes on that bull and when Marina Berti's character displays so much love and devotion to Leo Genn's. Genn is right up there with James Mason in quality and indeed Mason may have taken a few pointers from Genn's performance for his own acting in subsequent epics. Patricia Laffan is decadently sexy without being campy.Trivia scenes for the burning of Rome were sensibly used in MGM's 'The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao' and 'Atlantis The Lost Continent' to great effect.It is a credit to Merv LeRoy for allowing great actors like Peter Ustinov and Leo Genn to 'do their thing'.'Quo Vadis' is a classic a stunning spectacle intelligent good script fine performances by practically everybody and it remains long in the memory and holds up well indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quo Vadis based on the late nineteenth century novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz has been filmed many times in many lands for the cinema and for television. It was done as a Broadway play at the turn of the last century. But this is the version that most people remember and talk about. It's also the first of the big budget sand and scandal epics that the movies made to try and compete with that little home entertainment machine that was popping up in more and more homes. MGM built the magnificent sets the film was done on and sent Robert Taylor Deborah Kerr and the whole cast over to Italy to shoot it. Those sets later popped up in BenHur The Fall of the Roman Empire and dozens of Italian gladiator films. Supposedly somewhere in the cast of thousands both Elizabeth Taylor and Sophia Loren appeared as extras. Spot them if you can. Another extra was Lia DiLeo and gossip about her and Robert Taylor led to the break up of the Robert TaylorBarbara Stanwyck marriage.The story is about Robert Taylor as Marcus Vinicius Roman soldier and his lust then love for Christian girl Lygia played by Deborah Kerr. Their story is set against the background of the early Christian church in Rome and the persecution of it by the Emperor Nero.Taylor and Kerr are fine in the leads but in this case the supporting cast really overshadowed the stars. Peter Ustinov as Nero and Leo Genn as Petronius were both nominated for Best Supporting Actor of 1951 but lost to Karl Malden in Streetcar Named Desire. Peter Ustinov got a once in a lifetime part as Nero. It's the kind of role that one can overact outrageously and still convey all the sinister impulses that this villain possessed. Ustinov was compared with Charles Laughton as Nero in The Sign of the Cross and I wouldn't dare say who was better. My favorite part in this film has always been Leo Genn as Gaius Petronius. He's the only actor in the film who's holding his own with Ustinov. He's a pretty smart guy this Petronius keeping his place at the court by flattery and guile. It's a bitter pill for him to swallow when after Nero burns Rome the Rome he loves and has dedicated his life to. He could have prevented it by taking a righteous stand against the tyrant. But instead he played the cynic once too often and decides what he deems to be the only course of action open to him.Finlay Currie is a strong and hearty but aged St. Peter. My conception of St. Peter has always been that of Finlay Currie and in his youth that of Howard Keel in The Big Fisherman. Peter's a hands on kind of pastor used to hard work. After all he was a fisherman in his younger days and that certainly is outdoor work.Whether people are confirmed Christians or not will depend on how they take this film. We all can certainly admire the spectacle and the talent of the players. And nobody questions the atrocities committed by Emperor Nero against the early Christians.But at one point after Taylor realizes his love for Kerr he makes what I consider a quite reasonable offer to allow her to continue in her faith and he'll even put up whatever kind of chapel on the house grounds for that purpose. Not so says Kerr it's going to be all or nothing. That all or nothing attitude today has got a few people upset with organized religion for various reasons. But that's in the distant future from the First Century AD.".

At a time when television was making severe inroads into the motion picture industry QUO VADIS? provided a massive spectacle that the small screen could not compete against and the film rose to become the second biggest moneymaker MGM had produced at that point behind GONE WITH THE WIND.The tale is somewhat reminiscent of De Mille's SIGN OF THE CROSS and revolves around Roman commander Marcus Vinicius Robert Taylor in the role that would revive his career and make him the 'King' of 50s period epics fresh from a successful campaign who falls for beautiful Christian 'slave' Lygia the fetching Deborah Kerr. Much to the sympathetic amusement of his uncle Roman aristocrat Petronius worldly Leo Genn Lygia refuses to accept Vinicius' passes and when the he becomes more persistent he gets a bit roughedup by her bodyguardprotector brawny Ursus the legendary Buddy Baer. Thoroughly confused the soldier finds solace in the decadent court of the boy Emperor Nero Peter Ustinov who is superb stealing the film but he feels empty without Lygia to share in his triumph.Nero who is by turns petulant cruel and anxious to be accepted is being held somewhat in check by Petronius' careful manipulations but the more radical of his inner circle look for excuses to gain favor with 'Christian bashing' a sure way to win his heart. The stench of Rome on a hot summer night provides him an inspiration to burn much of it down blame the Christians then rebuild the city to his liking. Ignoring Petronius' protests which marks the end of his influence and ultimately his life Nero carries out his plan then takes many Christians prisoner including Lygia promising the irate citizens of Rome the gory spectacle of seeing justice done by lions. While Vinicius hasn't accepted Christianity yet he does recognize injustice and chooses to die with Lygia rather than live under a lunatic a theme that would be repeated in THE ROBE. In a takeoff of the Cretan Bull myth Nero stages an elaborate entertainment dressing the Christian girl in a nearly transparent gown revealing far more of Ms. Kerr than she probably wished! and tying her to a post he releases an enraged giant bull with only a barehanded Ursus to protect her. Realizing only a miracle can save the woman he loves Vinicius prays to the Christian God for help...and the epic climactic battle begins...MGM's first major production filmed in Rome QUO VADIS? is a very entertaining film which while fast and loose historically never ceases to impress with it's grandeur. While the 'human' side of the story isn't much Taylor is as always a bit wooden and Kerr hasn't much of a part to work with the performance of Ustinov is simply fabulous and if you look quickly you'll see Elizabeth Taylor and Sophia Loren in her first American film in unbilled bit parts.This is another 'classic' which deserves to be on DVD...when MGM decides to take that step add it to your collection you won't be disappointed!".

	schema:headline " Colossal and profound spectacle that indeed has its place in movie history!";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1st century Roman Empire the fire of Rome early Christianity martyrdom...this historical content was dealt with in many films before and after 1951. Yet it is LeRoy's QUO VADIS most viewers associate with the infamous period of Roman history the reign of Nero A.D. 5468. Why? There are I think several reasons. One is definitely the source a Noble Prize winner novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz. The Polish writer being an acknowledged historian contained detailed historical facts and a vivid fictitious story in his novel. As a result QUO VADIS is a universal masterpiece absolutely worth reading for anyone. But since the film though an adaptation of the book skips many events or even characters we may treat Mervyn LeRoy's QUO VADIS as a separate Hollywood production. In this respect the movie is also well known as a gigantic spectacle with great cast lavish sets crowds of extras which constitutes a magnificent journey to ancient Rome the Rome which was on the verge of becoming Neropolis. Then a viewer does not have to know the novel and will enjoy the film.THE STORY If we consider QUO VADIS? as an entertaining movie only which is of course a limited view then anyone more acquainted with cinema will find much in common with Cecil B DeMille's great epic THE SIGN OF THE CROSS 1932. Yet comparison does not work that well concerning the perspective of QUO VADIS 1951. After deeper analysis of the films a lot of differences occur. While DeMille's film based on Wilson Barret's play shows early Christianity in Rome it foremost concentrates on the clash between the new religion and the Roman order being put in danger. LeRoy's movie since based on Henryk Sienkiewicz's focuses on the undeniable victory of Christianity. Marcus Vinicius Robert Taylor at first finds a new faith meaningless. He has reasonable arguments from the Roman point of view what about slaves conquest enemy treating etc. Yet GRADUALLY thanks to love for Lygia Deborah Kerr and the courageous faith of the martyrs he shouts out with confidence Christ give him strength! The story of Nero and the imperial companions is also much more developed. Yet Nero Peter Ustinov is not only the one who heads for delicious debauchery but also wishes the crowd to have one throat that could be cut. He is an artist who burns Rome in order to create a song. He is a coward who blames the innocent for his own guilts. He is a cynic who collects tears in a weeping phial after the death of his best friend Petronius Leo Genn. Finally he is a lunatic who praises his divine ego and screams at his death seeing no future for Rome without him.CAST Anyone who has seen ancient epics must admit that most of them can boast great performances. Nevertheless I believe that QUO VADIS is one of the top movies in this matter. Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr are a gorgeous couple portraying a Roman leader and a Christian girl. Taylor naturally expresses a change of heart. Kerr appealingly portrays innocence gentleness and true love. Leo Genn is excellent as Petronius a man of art and elegance who is fed up with Nero's secondary songs and meaningless poems. Peter Ustinov gives a fabulous performance as Nero combining all wicked features of his character. I also loved Patricia Laffan as lustful empress Poppaea with her two pet leopards. There is no milk bath of hers she does not imitate Ms Colbert but Laffan's Poppaea is foremost a woman of sin a woman of lust and a woman of revenge. The Christians except for a number of extras are portrayed by very authenticlooking actors Abraham Sofaer as Paul and Finlay Currie as Peter...not more to say than that they look identical to the old paintings.SPECTACLE The movie is a visually stunning epic that can be compared in its magnificence to BEN HUR 1959 and even GLADIATOR 2000. There are numerous breathtaking moments arena scenes lions bull fighting triumph in the streets and foremost the fire of Rome. We see the real horror within the walls of the burning city. A moment that is also worth consideration is Vinicius hurrying to Rome on a chariot being chased by two other men. When he comes nearer we see the red sky... The authenticity is increased by a lovely landscape of Cinecitta Studios near Rome where the film was shot. For the sake of spectacle I went once to see QUO VADIS on a big screen in cinema and felt as if I watched a new film made with modern techniques. It was a wonderful experience. All in all I think that QUO VADIS by Mervyn LeRoy is a movie that has stood a test of time. Although it is 55 years old it is still admired in many places of the world. It's one of these movies that are the treasures of my film gallery. Not only a colossal spectacle not only great performances but a very profound historical content at which Henryk Sienkiewicz was best. QUO VADIS DOMINE? Where are you going Lord? These are the words that Peter asked Christ while leaving Rome. After the answer that Peter heard from his Lord he turned back... in order to proclaim peace to the martyrs and to be crucified. Yet where once stood decadent Neropolis now stands the Holy See where people yearly pilgrim to the tombs of the martyrs and where the blessing Urbi et Orbi is goes to all the corners of the world. Sienkiewicz writes about it in the touching final words of the novel. Yet LeRoy changes it a bit in the film...A small group of Christians who survived including Lygia and Marcus are on a journey. But after a short stop at the place where Peter met Christ the journey seems to turn into a pilgrimage towards the Way the Truth and the Life".

One is definitely the source a Noble Prize winner novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz. The Polish writer being an acknowledged historian contained detailed historical facts and a vivid fictitious story in his novel. As a result QUO VADIS is a universal masterpiece absolutely worth reading for anyone. But since the film though an adaptation of the book skips many events or even characters we may treat Mervyn LeRoy's QUO VADIS as a separate Hollywood production. In this respect the movie is also well known as a gigantic spectacle with great cast lavish sets crowds of extras which constitutes a magnificent journey to ancient Rome the Rome which was on the verge of becoming Neropolis. Then a viewer does not have to know the novel and will enjoy the film.THE STORY If we consider QUO VADIS? as an entertaining movie only which is of course a limited view then anyone more acquainted with cinema will find much in common with Cecil B DeMille's great epic THE SIGN OF THE CROSS 1932. Yet comparison does not work that well concerning the perspective of QUO VADIS 1951. After deeper analysis of the films a lot of differences occur. While DeMille's film based on Wilson Barret's play shows early Christianity in Rome it foremost concentrates on the clash between the new religion and the Roman order being put in danger. LeRoy's movie since based on Henryk Sienkiewicz's focuses on the undeniable victory of Christianity. Marcus Vinicius Robert Taylor at first finds a new faith meaningless. He has reasonable arguments from the Roman point of view what about slaves conquest enemy treating etc. Yet GRADUALLY thanks to love for Lygia Deborah Kerr and the courageous faith of the martyrs he shouts out with confidence Christ give him strength! The story of Nero and the imperial companions is also much more developed. Yet Nero Peter Ustinov is not only the one who heads for delicious debauchery but also wishes the crowd to have one throat that could be cut. He is an artist who burns Rome in order to create a song. He is a coward who blames the innocent for his own guilts. He is a cynic who collects tears in a weeping phial after the death of his best friend Petronius Leo Genn. Finally he is a lunatic who praises his divine ego and screams at his death seeing no future for Rome without him.CAST Anyone who has seen ancient epics must admit that most of them can boast great performances. Nevertheless I believe that QUO VADIS is one of the top movies in this matter. Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr are a gorgeous couple portraying a Roman leader and a Christian girl. Taylor naturally expresses a change of heart. Kerr appealingly portrays innocence gentleness and true love. Leo Genn is excellent as Petronius a man of art and elegance who is fed up with Nero's secondary songs and meaningless poems. Peter Ustinov gives a fabulous performance as Nero combining all wicked features of his character. I also loved Patricia Laffan as lustful empress Poppaea with her two pet leopards. There is no milk bath of hers she does not imitate Ms Colbert but Laffan's Poppaea is foremost a woman of sin a woman of lust and a woman of revenge. The Christians except for a number of extras are portrayed by very authenticlooking actors Abraham Sofaer as Paul and Finlay Currie as Peter...not more to say than that they look identical to the old paintings.SPECTACLE The movie is a visually stunning epic that can be compared in its magnificence to BEN HUR 1959 and even GLADIATOR 2000. There are numerous breathtaking moments arena scenes lions bull fighting triumph in the streets and foremost the fire of Rome. We see the real horror within the walls of the burning city. A moment that is also worth consideration is Vinicius hurrying to Rome on a chariot being chased by two other men. When he comes nearer we see the red sky... The authenticity is increased by a lovely landscape of Cinecitta Studios near Rome where the film was shot. For the sake of spectacle I went once to see QUO VADIS on a big screen in cinema and felt as if I watched a new film made with modern techniques. It was a wonderful experience. All in all I think that QUO VADIS by Mervyn LeRoy is a movie that has stood a test of time. Although it is 55 years old it is still admired in many places of the world. It's one of these movies that are the treasures of my film gallery. Not only a colossal spectacle not only great performances but a very profound historical content at which Henryk Sienkiewicz was best. QUO VADIS DOMINE? Where are you going Lord? These are the words that Peter asked Christ while leaving Rome. After the answer that Peter heard from his Lord he turned back... in order to proclaim peace to the martyrs and to be crucified. Yet where once stood decadent Neropolis now stands the Holy See where people yearly pilgrim to the tombs of the martyrs and where the blessing Urbi et Orbi is goes to all the corners of the world. Sienkiewicz writes about it in the touching final words of the novel. Yet LeRoy changes it a bit in the film...A small group of Christians who survived including Lygia and Marcus are on a journey. But after a short stop at the place where Peter met Christ the journey seems to turn into a pilgrimage towards the Way the Truth and the Life";

	schema:reviewBody "This biblical epic has Peter Ustinov giving the definitive performance of the emperor Nero in spite of the motion picture code. But then it seems they were always relaxing that motion picture code back in the 40's and 50's as long as it was for a biblical epic of some kind. In this case you see  although from a distance  lions carrying the limbs of dismembered Christians upon which they are feeding along with all of the other insinuations of decadence present under Nero. Robert Taylor who was normally a rather wooden actor IMHO did a very good job in this one as a Roman soldier entranced by a Christian girl. If you didn't know better you might think this film was the work of Cecil B. DeMille but instead the director was Mervyn Le Roy. Le Roy directed some of Warners fastpaced urban early sound films including Alice White's musicals Gold Diggers of Broadway Cagney's Hard to Handle Edward G. Robinson's Little Caesar and Three on a Match. He also directed one of Robert Taylor's other great performances in 1942's Johnny Eager unbelievably not on DVD. In other words Le Roy directed many crowdpleasers. This might explain why this film got seven or eight Oscar nominations but none for the director himself. He just wasn't considered good enough by the Academy to be in the club in spite of this excellent individual achievement.Everyone knows the popular legend. Nero burns Rome to clear the way for the magnificent city he wants to build but the peasants are revolting  literally. He then blames the odd and unpopular but quickly growing sect of the Christians for the burning and begins feeding them to the lions for the amusement of the Romans. However the Christians face death so bravely that Rome turns on Nero. Well that's the movie.The facts are much more in argument. In an ancient city such as Rome accidental fires that destroyed cities were common. In fact Nero did lead a massive relief effort after the fire and fires just as large broke out in Rome after Nero's death. Some historians do have the Christians confessing to the crime. The fact is that the people did begin to circulate rumors that Nero was at fault and he was responsible for blaming th Christians for the fire to save himself. He ordered to have them thrown to dogs though not lions as in the film. However one can somewhat overlook all of this historical jumping to conclusions and outright inaccuracy in the name of fine entertainment.".

It's a film I was quite clearly mixed about  one half of it I found a total bore the other half I was in love with. No prizes for guessing how I felt about which. Quo Vadis is of course the story of young Christianity during the rule of Emperor Nero in Rome. The Christians meet in secret with St. Peter and St. Paul and are mostly harmless at first. Nero is kind of a pretentious dope and fairly harmless too until he decides he must set fire to Rome for true artistic inspiration. Afterward however the poo hits the fan and he scapegoats Christians to get the heat off of him. Oh and there's a love story. Yes it's the love story that sinks Quo Vadis. Robert Taylor is an army leader who falls for hottie Deborah Kerr. She's a Christian though and that eventually leads him to the lion's den where he finally accepts the religion. Taylor has to be one of the blandest actors of all time and I hate to say this Kerr is no better in this film. She sure is beautiful but one just has to roll their eyes at her utter piety. Her love for him is ridiculously abrupt. One scene she is spurning him the next she has always been in love. Oh if only the film were all about Nero! Peter Ustinov is hammy as Hell but how else do you play Nero? And no one whom I've seen has ever done it better not even Charles Laughton. He of course was nominated for Best Supporting Actor as was Leo Genn as Petronius historically this character was more like Seneca who is a very minor character here. Genn is okay but rather forgettable after Ustinov. The only other performer who deserves mention is Patricia Laffan as Nero's wife Poppaea. Oh and Peter and Paul are here but the film loves to forget they even exist. There's a brief shot of the infamous upside down crucifixion but it's quickly passed by for more dull romance.".

Considering a difference in technology than 8 years can make this film compares fairly well with BenHur. There is great spectacle although widescreen had not yet been invented so that particular aspect is missing. But the sets and costumes are impressive in Technicolor if not a bit overdone. Did Rome really look that beautiful? Robert Taylor does very nicely here. He's no Charlton Heston but he plays the part of a Roman general well and looks the part. His costar is one of my favorite actresses of old  Deborah Kerr. I was a little less convinced with her role but still she does fine. I enjoyed Leo Genn also as one of Rome's elite his is a clever role  he's plays up to Nero while thinking him a fool. I remembered Genn from Plymouth Adventure starring Spencer Tracy filmed just one year later but he is much better is this film. The other performance of note here is Peter Ustinov as Nero. Apparently he played the role exactly as director Mervyn Leroy and won the Golden Globe as best supporting actor. I think today's audiences will find it just a bit over the top...but interesting.The story is quite simple really. A Roman officer Taylor falls in love with a conquered woman Kerr but makes the mistake of winning her through virtual slavery not love. She disappears and he discovers that she is a...gasp!...Christian. He finds her at a Christian meeting listening to Peter...THE Peter! From there things develop more quickly although this is a long movie...nearly 3 hours and we see an exciting chariot chase the spectacle of Rome burning some mildly gruesome deaths to Christians in the Coliseumbut also ultimately the death of Nero.This film is a little more preachy than BenHur and nonChristians may have a difficult time identifying with some portions of the film. But above all it is a story well told.An 8! A rating I rarely give. Highly recommended at least once.".

Enter Emperor Nero Peter Ustinov who orders that all Christians must be thrown to the lions leaving Marcus with no option but to deny his Pretorian ways and to try and save Lygia and her family. Rome will never be the same again.A big bold and lavish historical epic out of MetroGoldwynMayer that's directed by Mervyn LeRoy shot in glorious Technicolor by Robert Surtees  William V. Skall and is scored by Mikls Rzsa. Joining the big hitters in the cast are Leo Genn Finlay Currie Felix Aylmer  Abraham Sofaer. While the adaptation of Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel is written by S. N. Behrman Sonya Levien  John Lee Mahin. There's no denying that Quo Vadis meaning where are you going and appertaining to the encounter between St Peter and Jesus Christ on the Appian Way is a technical spectacle. It's also tough going for its over talky melodramatics during the first 90 minutes but you just have to stay with it once you are in you are in for the long haul. A whole afternoon in my case!For its time this was the bigger than than biggest a studios dream the cast of thousands the sets the costumes and the gazillion speaking parts that make up the story. It's also a point where the historical epic became more than just entertainment and a reason to make money. No doubt about it Quo Vadis is very pro Christian it has something to say even if ultimately it takes a long time to say it and is historically dubious. There's thought and intelligence within with that it pays to pay attention and sample the dialogue whilst feasting your eyes on the magnificence that surrounds the characters. Once the worthwhile action kicks in it's no let down the fights in the Coliseum the burning of Rome we can thank the great Anthony Mann for that one and the dramatic climax all make the time spent leading up to them more than worth it. The cast are mostly agreeable Kerr is gorgeous as ever and Taylor is ahem straight as ever while Ustinov goes full tilt campy loony. Genn steals the movie as Petronius while Patricia Laffan as Poppaea Sabina gives one of the most sensually minx like portrayals given in an historical epic.Some may find the religiose aspects over bearing but the spectacle does win out. Looking as gorgeous as ever now after being remastered Quo Vadis is a must see for like minded historical epic fans. It's some way down the pecking order of the genre greats but still a must see movie regardless. 710".

	schema:headline " One of the Greatest Screen Epics of All Time";
	schema:reviewBody "Quo Vadis is fairly well based upon Henryk Sienkiewicz's 1896 novel of the same name about first century Rome. Roman commander of the 14th Legion Marcus Vinicius Robert Taylor recently victorious in Britannia unlike the book where as a tribune he served under general Corbulo against the Parthians first camps in front of Rome then leads his legionaries in a triumphal parade in the presence of Emperor Nero Peter Ustinov. Vinicius although having positive attributes is quite irascible and angry. The tribune soon becomes lustful for the attractive Christian hostage Lygia Ligia Deborah Kerr. As Lygia has the bloodlines of royalty and is actually an adopted daughter of a Roman general she really would not be in a situation like a slave. With some difficulty Lygia successfully resists the Roman's advances although she is also physically attracted to him. Later the skeptical Marcus even rebukes Christian evangelist and philosopher Paul Abraham Sofaer of Tarsus but not in the novel. But overall Vinicus despite his faults and personal struggles is dedicated and deplores injustice and does not hate ordinary Roman people. In contrast his emperor the unbalanced and petulant Nero has contempt for the Roman populace. Nero's excesses are encouraged by the sycophant Sicilian Praetorian Prefect Tigellinus Ralph Truman although they are somewhat moderated by the perceptive court flatterer Gaius Petronius Leo Gunn. Worldly  but not a scoundrel  Petronius is an historical figure who wrote the famous Satyricon. Note the sardonic Petronius' use of wit and double entendre. Petronius is Marcus' uncle who advises his nephew to apply to Nero for a provincial governorship but Marcus declines. In Nero's court is also the famous historical philosopher Seneca who is already falling from favor as in the book. Nero fancies himself to be a great artiste. He has a secret plan to set fire to the Eternal City so that he can have the available land to build his Golden Palace and gardens. Behind Nero is his lustful wife Poppaea Patricia Laffan who knows the double entendre Emperor Nero as Marcus Vinicius and his Roman soldiers march by Come closer. Look. They march as they fight strong brave relentless  our unconquerable children. We must take them to our breasts. Poppaea thinking about Marcus Vinicius Yes my lord! Nero orders Tigellinus to burn Rome happily he sings while playing the lute or lyre. Marcus bravely helps to save many people. An unforeseen consequence is that the Roman mob becomes outraged and turns against the emperor. Heartless Poppaea's solution? Just blame the Christians two rabbis proposed this action in the book. So the Christians are rounded up and jailed including the nowsoftening Marcus and will be lions' lunch. How can Marcus find a way to save them especially Lygia? Will Roman general Galba head of the Roman legions in the north now take the lead to end Nero's madness? Some nice scenes include a primitive Christian Catholic mass conducted in the Roman Catacombs by the Apostle Peter himself in the book a cemetery was the setting. Later we witness his crucifixion upsidedown at his request after he marries Marcus and Lygia symbolic of the eventual Christian triumph. There is a fight in the Colosseum between giant Ursus Buddy Baer and a Cretan bull in the book a nowextinct aurochs . We also learn about the origins of the phrase Quo vadis Domine? Where are you going Lord?. The answer is that the Lord was going to Rome to be crucified a second time. But of course He was summoning Peter to his destiny decades earlier the apostle had denied Christ thrice in Jerusalem. No more running! It was time to set an example that will eventually transform the entire Roman Empire! Rome The Eternal City has a new destiny. The movie does provide a good summary of what caused Nero's regime to collapse. And when his plans backfire and nearly everyone turns against him it is death or flight. As Rome had conquered the Western World there were not too many hiding places available. Nero sick insane? is pitiful in death.HISTORICAL FACT Despite Nero's murderous ways the first part of his reign was successful as he left much control to competent advisers like Seneca. Around 62 AD he changed and turned against his best advisers and the Christians. In the movie the setting is already 64 AD and the events of the next four years are compressed into one. Nero's reign did usher in the FIRST persecution LOCAL of the Christians. And a male slave of Greek origin not a female helped him to commit suicide.There are many speaking parts but only a few major ones will be mentioned here. Peter Ustinov a scenestealer may have played his greatest role as the unpredictable and later beleaguered emperor. Leo Gunn is also great. Petronius may be a worldly flatterer but he also exudes sympathy and pathos especially when he is resigned to his fate. Both men received Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor although they did not win. Robert Taylor although stilted convinces as a cynically pagan Roman officer. Deborah Kerr even if a bit too old plays a believable Christian girl courageous in her faith. Her blue gown appears almost transparent when she is in the arena it is quite revealing. In fact many martyrs were indeed stripped of much clothing before execution. Finlay Currie Peter Patricia Laffan Poppaea and Marina Berti Eunice all shine. See if you can spot Sophia Loren Lygia's slave girl and Elizabeth Taylor Christian prisoner in the arena.Production values are extremely high cinematography camerawork lavish sets authenticlooking costumes true cast of thousands spectacular Miklos Rozsa music score and onlocation filming at Cinecitta in Rome! Quo Vadis is better than Spartacus 1960 and Gladiator 2000 and certainly more historically factual. The public responded well to MGM's QV at the time only GWTW 1939 made more money. They just don't make 'em like this anymore. Underrated.".

How much better the film would have been if Rzsa's music had been allowed to blaze across the screen.  Quo Vadis lacks the visual splendour of BenHur it COULD but for LeRoy's timid way with the music have had an even greater sonic splendour to compensate.It's the Christians I don't like.  I suspect the early Christians really were like this  unable to so much as comment on the weather without ostentatiously mentioning Jesus  and knowing as we do how they would soon triumph and overrun the world how can we possibly take their side?  We can and we do largely because of Peter Ustinov's lovingly hateful portrayal of Nero.  He makes a wonderful villain.  If you look past the fact that this film was INTENDED to be Christian propaganda you'll see that the real hero perhaps antihero of the piece is the pagan Petronius everything not directly concerned with the relationship between him Nero and the relationship between them is mere subplot.

Leo Genn is a clever courteous Petronius blandly flattering the tyrant  until he is finally outmanoeuvered by his enemies and then elegantly taking his own life in the Roman manner. The religious theme is well treated the threatened Christians being shown in a respectful and not overly sentimental light even when being martyred.  The film suffers somewhat from a rather anachronistic concern with the rights of man and a typically American antislavery theme which would not have had any place in first century Rome but these are not major flaws.  The love story between Marcus and Lygia is secondary to the big spectacular scenes such as the triumphant entry of the legions into Rome the burning of the city and the Colosseum scenes.

Problems aside Quo Vadis is a film of visual spectacle and grandeur. You can never go wrong with sweeping cinematography lavish scope sets and scenery and colourful costumes and Quo Vadis succeeds in all these areas. Mervyn LeRoy directs excellently while Miklos Rosza's score is absolutely magnificent. The performances are solid Robert Taylor does a good job playing it straight and isn't too dull and Deborah Kerr is as ravishing as ever but it is Leo Genn playing Petronious more than admirably and especially a superb Peter Ustinov as Nero that walk away with the picture.

The transformation is quite moving and the characters seem very real everyday people.  Equally interesting the film crosses documentary with cinema story to interface and comment on reality TV. Kudos. In spite of the seeming capitulation to Hollywoodstyle romance and happy endings  very uncharacteristic of Norwegian films  this is an outstanding story about status using people allegiance to success and stardom vs. allegiance to caring for human beings especially friends.  Buddy goes through somewhat annoying yoyo relationships that need more definition and less reliance on fickle happenstance.  The choices are not black and white and the characters struggle in them.  The topical relevance to 'reality' TV is especially poignant.  In spite of the overemphasis on finding romance and happiness in loyalty and responsibility I give it 910.  One of the most provocative real yet uplifting European films of the year. Worth watching multiple times.".

But before the host signs off on his boss' latest concept he asks KristofferNicolai Cleve Broche if Stig IngeAnders Baasmo Christiansen an agoraphobic will be able to withstand the attention and public scrutiny that a television personality unconditionally merits. Sensing the truth about his roommate's neurosis as being a potential dealbreaker Kristoffer agrees with his employer's coercive assertion that Stig Inge is only acting just like any person in the reality TV genre.For now the gig is a boom for Kristoffer but it's only delaying the inevitable reckoning that fateful day he compares his younger self on videotape with the face staring back at him in the mirror. Before this stroke of luck ElisabethJane Formoe a partner at a PR firm breaks up with Kristoffer soon after he resists her gentle needling that he commit more fully to their relationship? And who can blame her? When she visits Kristoffer to get her house key back he's playing table hockey with GeirAksel Hennie in a residence more suitable for young adults fresh out of college. Suddenly without a girlfriend Kristoffer realizes that he and Geir need careersthey hang advertisements on billboards but before this epiphany has a chance to really sink in the television station calls and growing up is put on hold.Borrowing a page from Swedish filmmaker Lars Von Trier this Norwegian production has an English title. While Buddy is not a caustic film by any means Norwegian culture has clearly been subordinated by American popular culture in the lives of Kristoffer and Geir whose work is clearly derived from the MTV reality show starring Johnny Knoxville. Just like a real American these two Norwegian males seem to have fallen into an interminable adolescence. After Geir jumps out of a fivestory window American rock musicin the alternative vein accompanies Kristoffer's escape from the TV station's securitymen. Those dropped tapes lead to their Jackassinspired antics being aired to public acclaim an endorsement of American's worst excesses which makes jackasses out of the Norwegian people. Although Kristoffer is essentially the same Charlie's Angels tshirtwearing layabout he was before the split Elisabeth returns to him despite the fact that's he's getting his money for nothing despite the fact of being a real jackass when he betrays Geir by airing his personal life to the viewing public.While shooting a group of kids kicking around a soccer ball Kristoffer finds Geir's kid among the assembling bodies. The stuntman can longer hold back the years. When Kristoffer points his camera towards Geir on some high scaffolding we realize that his daredevil work is an act of fatalism not bravery or rather postbravery that stems from having a death wish. While the sequence of this drama unravels Kristoffer expressed his own maturity through filmmaking. This time Geir's derringdo has a context unlike previous stunts that revealed nothing about this secret father except his own apparent stupidity. Context is what Kristoffer needed too. HenriettePia Tjelta gives the filmmaker context whom he freezes on his display panel. Adulthood transformed Kristoffer's aesthetics now it'll transform his life.Grilled by another talk show host about how Kristoffer's films continue to exploit a mentallydisturbed man the talk show host defends himself by insisting that Stig Inge is an actor. To help ward off further criticism the friendly introvert consents to a live appearance and predictably he freezes in front of the camera. Although Buddy lays the blame on Kristoffer for bamboozling the producer and host it's hard to believe that people in the television industry would care one way or another if Stig Inge was an actor or not. It's all about ratings not ethics. Buddy wants to show that Norwegian television is more ethical than American television so it makes Kristoffer the scapegoat when Stig Inge melts down. To calm his subject down the filmmaker becomes a friend and sings a soccer fight song to relieve Stig Inge of all the attention. In this moment Kristoffer comes full circle he's a different man from that other guy who filmed his subject outside the grocery store unable to pick up a soda can that rolled past his safety zone. Kristoffer loses his show and just in time. He can't be a jackass for the rest of his life.".

A showhost sees one of these tapes and thinks it would be great mini to have in his show. He contacts the guys and the main story begins. In addition there's alot about Kristoffer's love life Geir's problem with the fact a fact he keeps hidden from everyone else that he has a child with a girl he went to school with and the third roommate Stig Inge who has some problems leaving the immediate area around the flat.When I first saw the trailer to the movie I thought it was just another lousy Norwegian film. But I changed my mind after my school went to see it. It may have many cliches? but it something about it that makes you look around them and truly enjoy the movie. It is indeed a great movie.

Then i realized that i recognized one of the characters the one named Geir. i realized that i had seen another one of his movies from Netflix about a week earlier called UNO.

Some of them are akin to stunts from the American show Jackass while others are just day to day activities the three men are involved in as they are room mates. Oddly when they are shown on TV the three become instant smalltime celebrities and instead of life getting better for the guys things get much worse and quite strained.While the plot is a bit easy to predict in some places particularly regarding Kristoffer's girlfriends the predictability isn't a serious detriment because it's such a nice and quirky sort of filmthe sort you'll only see in foreign and independent films. Plus there are enough surprises and good acting that the overall effort is very pleasant to watch and well worth a look.

At first I was a little bit reluctant to see this title as if it didn't appear to be appealing to my liking. Yet after reconsidering and actually watching it I must admit that it's a brilliant movie that displays human interaction in terms of love and friendship in a very simplistic way that is perfection of its own kind. The twists and turns into the movie are a very nicely thought way of portraying the love between the characters having them growing up as individuals together with that and actually having to take the responsibilities of the adults' life abandoning the troubleless carefree existence yet not to full extent. A thing that impressed me a lot into this movie was the very realistic without any unneeded drama and overacting way that shows the troublesome life of Stig Inge  one of the main characters of the movie  who is constantly followed by his anxiety and fear to live a normal life outside the boundaries of Tyen  a neighborhood in Oslo where most of the action of the movie takes place. A movie that would have been a complete failure if it took the wrong turn of falling for the part of portraying the reality show like way of life of the main characters instead used it as a tool to show the viewer what really matters instead of the misconception of fame and glory and in the same time to remain nice and simplistic to what it should really be after it all  a perfect movie about love and friendship. I give 9 out of 10 just because I could use a tiny bit better camera work yet it remains one of the best Norwegian movies I've seen by far.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really liked this film. It reminded me of Four Weddings and a Funeral with the ensemble cast and gentle comedydrama genre that involves friends and lovers misunderstandings and miscommunications. The actors are pretty believable in their roles and the characters stay with you even after the film has ended. Kristopher Nicolai Cleve Broch keeps a video diary of silly goofy exploits that he and his friend Geir Aksel Hennie perform while tooling around town in between hanging up billboard signs. They are twentysomething and carefree until love and other commitments vie for their attention. Kristopher is well meaning and sometimes finds it difficult to navigate his life. The two friends decide to move in with Stig Inge Anders Baasmo Christiansen. They barely know Stig but as one of them puts it the rent is cheap. They end up becoming very chummy with their new roommate and when Stig offers a room for rent to another new roommate Henriette Pia Tjelta they become chummy with her too. Kristopher is unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend at the beginning of the film. He is very hurt by this but she continually gives him the brush off whenever he tries to reconcile the relationship. During one particular dangerous escapade around town Kristopher drops some of his video tapes while being chased by a security guard... and then the fun begins.It was nice to see how people in other countries live. And it was nice to see how other countries look as well. I thought it showed how we are all alike in some ways probably more alike than not. In the vast expanse of the universe we all inhabit the same blue planet and we really do have common basic needs like love life and laughter. Buddy is a very heart warming movie with good character development. Definitely see it if you can.".

Yes the first half takes the graph higher and higher. Enter Vidya Balan and the movie sinks deeper than Titanic. If the little baby steals your heart in the first half the big baby smashes it with equal vengeance.Akki Its a role which has various layers to it and da man does not falter a bit. A meaty role amongst the trio. In Dil Toh Paagal Hain it was guest role for Akki but now its payback time for SRK.Vidya Balan The lethargic nasal voice maybe your signature style but you are overdoing it. And in the name of versatility if you attempting to break the Parineeta mould in one go caution... you may fall flat on your face.Boman Irani as the Inspector was fantastic while Boman Irani in comic part was a big downer. And why the false alarm of heartattack as a mere chest pain? Fardeen Khan loved him in his ChupkeChupke attire and of course the take it slowly episode.Ritiesh Deshmukh dependable as usual and IMO he should stop getting slapped in every other movie. Politics and underworld nexus go handinhand beware! And finally of course being Farah Khan's sibling Hey Baby has a miniature parade of Bollywood faces in the title song only fairer sex but.".

Yes the first half takes the graph higher and higher. Enter Vidya Balan and the movie sinks deeper than Titanic. If the little baby steals your heart in the first half the big baby smashes it with equal vengeance.Akki Its a role which has various layers to it and da man does not falter a bit. A meaty role amongst the trio. In Dil Toh Paagal Hain it was guest role for Akki but now its payback time for SRK.Vidya Balan The lethargic nasal voice maybe your signature style but you are overdoing it. And in the name of versatility if you attempting to break the Parineeta mould in one go caution... you may fall flat on your face.Boman Irani as the Inspector was fantastic while Boman Irani in comic part was a big downer. And why the false alarm of heartattack as a mere chest pain? Fardeen Khan loved him in his ChupkeChupke attire and of course the take it slowly episode.Ritiesh Deshmukh dependable as usual and IMO he should stop getting slapped in every other movie. Politics and underworld nexus go handinhand beware! And finally of course being Farah Khan's sibling Hey Baby has a miniature parade of Bollywood faces in the title song only fairer sex but.";

Come on guys making a movie on a subject involving an eight month old movie and getting the right expressions when necessary is a tough task.Also it featured Akshay Kumar arguably one of the most versatile actors of this generation.The combo along with Rietesh and Fardeen does well in tickling the funny bone at most of the places.Now u may ask why didn't it get a 1010 if the script is wellessayed and actors of such talent give their best?????The answer lies in the screenplay......Ya couldn't resist a yawn at some places especially in the second half.The movie kicks off very wellthe title track is scorching.But postintermission portions become really heavy at times.It again picks up though towards the climaxcoming to a predictable end.The music is very peppythe cinematography captures Australia well though there are very few outdoor scenes.Coming to the cast Akshay Kumar once again proves why he's one of the most bankable stars today.Flawless acting with humour and sorrow expressed perfectly.Rietesh masters his supporting role quite well Fardeen still has lots to do with his dialogue delivery.Vidya Balan is wasted mostly what was Sajid thinking when he casted him for a role lasting only 30 min....SeriouslyVidya has to start thinking about the roles she's doin these days whether it's GuruSalaameishq aur Eklavya.Boman Iraani is good though underutilised. SRK and anupam Kher relive their DDLJ relationship for a cameo.Allinall an entertainer which gets 7 stars for the movie and one extra for the performances ........ Familygoers are advised thoughthe movie is not that clean......DSajidi'm looking forward to ur next......Best Of luck......".

The story as everyone knows is a horrible variation of the original Trois hommes et un couffin which was hollywooded into 3 men and a baby.The second half has some good scenes by Akshay kumar but not worthy enough to be called as Saving grace. The kid is cute no doubt.It's been quite sometime since I've been to a movie and felt the need to advice people to stay away if possible.".

No matter what Sajid would like to believe until the moment Vidya arrives to take away her baby this is a complete ripoff of TMAAB. IMO that was a rather pathetic film with three talentless actors and this comes close in that sense too. Ritesh is the only one who even comes close to acting Akki should go back to kung fu and being a stunt man Fardeen is laughably pathetic. Even Vidya has nothing to bite into for a role her costumes are atrocious and she has the most colorless role ever. Boman is doing a chimpanzee act. Granted the baby is cute and she acts the best of the lot as she is only required to smile which she does endearingly well or cry which she excels at. The men making one off color joke after another the horrible Aussie actresses the endless clichs baby dying prayers being said men breaking down in a most unbelievable manner baby food and poop jokes make this one of the worst films I have seen but I have not seen Partner yet! A final word on the guest appearances by SRK and Anupam Kher  why did they bother to show up? They added nothing to the film and did nothing of note.My advice  if you want low brow comedy then watch TMAAB for high brow stuff try Full Monty which HB tried to ripoff too! but this one is not worth the money.".

The scenes where they are making lists of all the women they've slept with were over done. I mean in this day of Aidsherpes I hope people are not so casual. Not to mention that these boys and many of their respective girlfriends are Indian so there should be a cultural aspect to this too. Calling the baby a bitch was rude. Babies cry poop and don't let you sleep but that's how they communicate. To leave her in the rain was unbelievable. I don't think anyone with any conscience would do something like that. What I hated about this film too many sexual innuendos and jokes the Australian actors were annoying The scenes where they try to win over Vidiya's character were so boring and not even funny. Vidiya should stick to films like Parineeta and Bhool Bhulaiya she is wasting her talent in these cheesy films and she looks much better in a sari then in western gear. Fardeen always comes across as having too much attitude. What I liked about this film. The songs were really good. The baby was cute. Ritesh is always a pleasure to watch despite a poor screenplay and stupid dialogues  not his fault.".

The director had really no script in mind and comedy was really forced. I think Sajid Khan needs to see Bheja Fry to understand that by doing stupid actions and creating childish situation you cannot make someone laugh though there will be people who will enjoy it. Vidya Balan Bomman Irani were a complete waste in the movie.This proves a point that if you are a star kid or from the industry it is easy to make a movie get number of actorsactresses to do friendly appearances which again was a waste and boast on TV as if you are making the best movie ever seen. But Mr. director please grow up and try to make a sensible comedy. Yes we can still leave our mind at home to watch a movie but there should be some sense and element in your work.Overall this movie deserves 1 out of 10 star some points deducted because of hyped expectation which it fails to meet.Thanks Saurabh".

This disappointed me totally.Trailers of the movie were shown in such a way that viewers would expect it to be an all out comedy. One thinks that Akshay Kumar in a fun film will be full of laughter. Guess what you won't laugh at all. There are few comic scenes but won't make you laugh at all. Besides that it has Desi masala content which now people had enough from Bollywood movies so no one likes them anymore.Songs are all over the place never blending with the situation anywhere. And there is an unexpected tragedy waiting for you which no one wants to see. It gave totally wrong impression from the trailers.Director Sajid Khan should understand that he has made a movie for masses and adding many songs  actresses in one song can't make a film any better. He should learn something from others. Script is also dull it has no soul never holds one during the movie. On top of that it has predictability in the end.I have given 5 ratings just for good efforts by the cast.Final verdict no content only songs total crap.Don't even dare to watch it.".

These three idiots then decide they love this near dead wet baby and get her revived... so they can skip and romp around the landmarks of Sydney to our further head shaking bewilderment.

Its amazing that the movie has so much comedy and yet it has emotional scenes too. The first song in this film has many sexy actresses in it my favorite has to be Diya Mirza.

Only saving grace in the movie were the last thirty minutes which were seriously funny elsewhere the movie fails miserably. First half was desperately been tried to look funny but wasn't.

Acting is good but thats not enough to keep one interested.For the positives you can take hot actresses last 30 minutes some comic scenes good acting by the lead cast and the baby. Only problem is that these things do not come together properly to make a good movie.Anyways I read somewhere that It isn't a copy of Three men and a baby but I think it would have been better if it was.".

	schema:reviewBody "As if one were needed Heyy Babyy is a twohourplus remake of the1987 hit Three Men and a Baby which was itself an adaptation of a French film from 1985. This Bollywood production features three swinging bachelors from India who share a swanky apartment in a high class quarter of Sydney Australia. One day they find an abandoned baby on their doorstep along with a note declaring that one of the men  it's not stated which  is the girl's father. Naturally this leads to all kinds of predictable slapstick hijinks as the three inept and bumbling playboys take on the new and challenging role of fathers to this adorable tyke.It's hard to convey just how grueling  nay excruciating  an experience sitting through Heyy Babyy turns out to be. What with all the pratfalling and mugging and fastmotion photography Heyy Babyy makes even the most inane Three Stooges short look like a Noel Coward play in comparison. Suffice it to say the script is unbelievably banal the comic ideas antiquated and poorly executed and the acting so cheesy and overthetop that after only a few minutes' exposure to this drivel you'll be agreeing with the French as to the comic genius of Jerry Lewis.Yet the only thing more insufferable than Heyy Babyy when it's in a playful mood is Heyy Babyy when it's being all highminded and sanctimonious cranking up the goo to almost unimaginable proportions as this angel sent from God turns three selfindulgent and immature womanizers into hypersensitive and morally responsible young men  and the audience into a bunch of oohing and aahing sentimental slobs.So if your idea of a good time is religious symbolism mixed with poop jokes and padded out to an unendurable length with endless musical numbers by all means feel free to indulge yourself in all that Heyy Babyy has to offer in that regard. Otherwise run for your life as far and as fast as you can the moment Heyy Babyy appears on a screen near you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though being an adaption of the Hollywood flick 3 Men and a little lady  the direction of the film is a lot refreshing. Sajid Khan in his directorial debut has done a fantastic job. No where in the film do you feel any drab. He has perfectly inculcated the 20 min story which the western film moguls like Universal  Columbia Tristar train their directors before commencing on a film shooting. The thesis behind this 20 min story is that  before one actually gets into the main story of the film  there is always a period of 20 mins for films to run around the bush in order to settle the audience. This can perfectly be seen in the sitcoms like Friends  The Simpsons..etc who follow a 5 min story. What's more refreshing about the movie is that the assisting director has done a good job as well. Unlike some recent movies like Om Shanti Om  though the front direction was good  the main reason why people did not like the movie is because the assistant director was not good at all. The junior artists in the background portrayed very bad characters and very not directed well to do so. There are a very few films that have the codirector working equally as well as the main director . Some of the films include blockbusters like Sarkar  Lagaan..etc.Overall the movie is worth to be seen at least once by all movie goers .And yes the baby is also cute !!!!".

At the moment I'm even trying to imagine how it feels watching this picture without being able to refer anytime to the knowledge of the book and the cultural background. I guess it makes you feel lost and emptyheaded.First of all the screen play was created in a very unusual way. The dialogs were not written but extracted from the poem some of them being full rhyming lines and some only parts. Of course most of the meaningful and informative pieces were in the narrative section of the poem and somehow didn't make it to the screen. I'm all for show not tell but don't show don't tell everybody knows it all from school is not the top shelf of moviemaking to me.All that is shown is pretty people pretty costumes pretty interiors pretty nature. Definitely pleasant to see for anyone who likes pictures with historical settings and would like to get to know something about the life in a particular time and place.The movie really works only for people who have read the poem and have been taught about its historical background. After such preparation they can enjoy this multimedia reconstruction of the characters and places from the book because that's rather what it is to me. Indeed all the actors are good music memorable and all the details nicely done but this production really lacks the cinematic backbone and something that would allow it to be a movie on its own.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the modern times absorbed so much by computers technology materialism it seems that such values like love patriotism sense of beauty and quest for the sublime belong to the days of yore the days of fairies poets and nobles. Yet on such occasions like national holidays that usually serve to remind nations of their identities human thoughts go towards our ancestors those who created a nation played a decisive role in what we are and who we are now. And in this very spirit on November the 11th when my country celebrates the Independence Day my friends and I have decided to see the significant movie by Andrzej Wajda. It is worth stating here that the film the action of which takes place in 1811 and 1812 16 years after Poland was entirely partitioned among Germany Austria and Russia is based on the key work of Polish literature  12 Books of Verse titled PAN TADEUSZ and written in Paris in the 1830s by the famous Pole Adam Mickiewicz 17981855. The goals of watching being purely patriotic the movie appeared to us as convincing more to say interesting from the very beginning. However the experience of the movie was not merely a patriotic awareness that would truly be applied to a limited number of viewers but something much more something I would like to share with other people no matter what nationality upbringing culture they are  a treasure that seems lost in most modern movies yet found in the great effort to craft cinematic productions based on classical literature. Certainly it is a serious effort to adapt 1800s' romantic verses to the expectations of modern movie buffs...O Lithuania my country thou Art like good health I never knew till now How precious till I lost thee. translation by Kenneth R. MackenzieThat is how PAN TADEUSZ by Adam Mickiewicz begins that is how PAN TADEUSZ by Andrzej Wajda ends and what is in between? A great story of courage love sensation uprising honor politics in the times of Napoleon  a great hope for the partitioned Poland confession and ... reconciliation something classical universal touching humane pure and upright. One could indeed enumerate such adjectives... How does it work in practice? On the one hand we have a particular focus on national identity and duty while on the other hand the emphasis is drawn upon particular characters. To view comes young Tadeusz Soplica Michal Zebrowski in love with two female characters one is Zosia Alicja Bachleda  a 14yearold girl of youthful innocent joys the other is Telimena Grazyna Szapolowska  a lady of extravagant behavior and tastes of luxury. In between come various characters including impetuous Gerwazy Daniel Olbrychski young countartist Horeszko Marek Kondrat and a humble priest Robak Boguslaw Linda who hides his secret till the very last hour of his life ... The factor that goes with characters and more specifically the manner we perceive them is the strongest point of the movie performances. Although the task to play the roles and say their lines in poem appears to be particularly difficult most of the cast craft their performances with exceptional flair. It is thanks to them that we all may feel the story go on naturally. Daniel Olbrychski is magnificent as Gerwazy focusing on the aforementioned impetuosity Boguslaw Linda can be referred to as 'convincing modesty' Ms Szapolowska says her lines with desirable elegance and Michal Zebrowski together with youthful Alicja Bachleda are a fine staff for the couple in love.Since Mickiewicz payed particular attention to the descriptions of nature the film does not skip this aspect. It can boast wonderful shots of the green fields memorable clouds returning storks silent forests and beautiful sunsets. Being filmed in an artistic manner it evokes a unique atmosphere and constitutes a sort of moving painting of idyllic landscapes. The narration by Adam Mickiewicz portrayed by Krzysztof Kolberger adds more importance to it providing the emotions of the author. The brilliant direction by Andrzej Wajda and the musical score by Wojciech Kilar supply a viewer with undeniable experience. Moreover some scenes remain so intensely in the memory that any sensitive viewer sensitive to art will truly be absorbed by watching. Here I would like to mention famous bear hunting confession of Jacek Soplica and witty but elegant coffee making sequence. Just a pity there is not a famous mushroom picking tour described widely by Mickiewicz.If you asked me what this movie means to me my answer would be simple an experience for eyes and soul great cinema which returns after a period of absence which returns like the upright storks that long for the sublimity of patriot's homeland.".

So this is a directfromtheheart comment on the 'naked' movie.I am truly sorry to say  and this will probably hurt many Polish spectators  that I think that as a film 'Pan Tadeusz' has some important failures. Not being Polish I do not have an automatic sympathy for Polish films in general or for films about Polish history or about Polish literary works. I believe that for nonPolish audiences  or even for Polish nonliteraryeducated audiences  the film is hard to digest  if digestible at all. Besides even my Polish friends were quite disappointed and I think I understand why.The first hour of the film is particularly hard to follow. Lots of names situations storylines without any explanation a language that is archaic if not swollen and characters that are neither introduced nor stay on the screen long enough to become interesting with the obvious exception of Gervazy  although the man does not need to scream so much all the time if you ask me.During the second hour I got some clue about what was going on particularly when it came to the fighting scenes no I am not fond of fighting scenes but at least I know what they are about and with the help of my Polish company who gave some  explanations. It is never a good sign if you need other  people's explanations to understand a film.The ending of the film got me back to the more chaotic circumstances of the beginning but it included a rather forced attempt to solve the 'plot' and then again left us with an open ending which did not interest me.In all I think that in the transition from the poem 'Pan Tadeusz' to the film 'Pan Tadeusz' Wajda lost the strong points of the 'poem' genre and failed to include the strong points of the 'film' genre. A 25 hour film focuses the spectator more on the storyline than a 20 hour book. The storyline of 'Pan Tadeusz' however is for nonPolish audiences too thin and too mysterious to comprehend or value.Fortunately there is one aspect that was enjoyable the gorgeous cinematography the great landscapes the fine camera movements and the nice colours. Here I could see and recognize what a great cinematographer Wajda is I never doubted that. I just think that there were some unfortunate premisses at play in the idea of translating the literary work 'Pan Tadeusz' into a movie. At least it did not work for me.".

The film is a historical romance based on conflicts between two families and also within the ranks of Polish patriots.The movie is set during a period when Poland had been divided between Prussia Russia and Austria. There wasn't a country called Poland. One of the internal divisions within Polish patriots was whether to cooperate with Russia or whether to support Napoleon as a liberator.There's a story within that story. One family member was shot by a member of another family. They have sworn eternal hatred. And like the Montagues and the Capulets the son of one family is in love with the daughter of the other family.Some reviewers have said that only Poles and Lithuanians can understand and enjoy this movie. I disagree. NonPolish viewers like me may miss some of the subtleties but the basic plot lines are clear enough. Wajda was a genius and this film demonstrates the wide range of his abilities. He can write about grim postWWII Poland but he can also direct a large sweeping epic. We saw Pan Tadeusz in 35mm at the wonderful Dryden Theatre at Rochester's George Eastman Museum. It was presented in collaboration with the Skalny Center for Polish and Central European Studies at the University of Rochester.This film has a terrible IMDb rating of 6.1. Did the people watching it see the same movie I saw? Possibly they saw it on the small screen where it won't work as well. My suggestion is to ignore the low rating and try to find Pan Tadeusz and watch it. You won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Andrzej Wajda has been a great director at least as far back as Kanal in 1957. Tough films provocative themes.But why the costume drama? I really wish he'd left this one alone.It's not unlike 1999's other bloated Polish historical epic Ogniem i mieczem With Fire and Sword. Here again Poles put aside their differences to prove they're the greatest people or at least the greatest Slavs on Bg's green earth. Rah rah. A crowd of Polish lesser gentry rabble armed with swords can defeat trained Russian musketry any day.And yes I am of Polish descent myself although I'm embarrassed to admit it in this jingoistic context. That's why I was at the special screening in the first place sponsored by Toronto's Polish newspaper.Pan Tadeusz shares another characteristic with its elephantine contemporary its ability to confuse nonPolishspeaking members of the audience with its vast number of characters and their poorly defined interrelationships.Both films too have a sudsy quality. So did Gone With The Wind but then character definition makes that historical epic a success. Tadeusz and Zosia are indistinct phantoms as personalities. Certainly no Rhett or Scarlett.With Fire and Sword is more melodramatic than Pan Tadeusz but it's also more exciting. This film has a laudable grandeur which Wajda brings to the proceedings but still I wish he'd picked a subject with a bit more substance.Wojciech Kilar can be congratulated on his score. And Daniel Olbrychski is always good to see even with scars all over his head.It should be noted that Polishspeaking spectators at the theatre appeared to find this film quite enjoyable. They would be chuckling at clever turns of phrase in the dialogue while the English titles would be saying something indescribably prosaic. Evidently the film loses nearly everything in translation.".

That's why I was at the special screening in the first place sponsored by Toronto's Polish newspaper.Pan Tadeusz shares another characteristic with its elephantine contemporary its ability to confuse nonPolishspeaking members of the audience with its vast number of characters and their poorly defined interrelationships.Both films too have a sudsy quality. So did Gone With The Wind but then character definition makes that historical epic a success. Tadeusz and Zosia are indistinct phantoms as personalities. Certainly no Rhett or Scarlett.With Fire and Sword is more melodramatic than Pan Tadeusz but it's also more exciting. This film has a laudable grandeur which Wajda brings to the proceedings but still I wish he'd picked a subject with a bit more substance.Wojciech Kilar can be congratulated on his score. And Daniel Olbrychski is always good to see even with scars all over his head.It should be noted that Polishspeaking spectators at the theatre appeared to find this film quite enjoyable. They would be chuckling at clever turns of phrase in the dialogue while the English titles would be saying something indescribably prosaic. Evidently the film loses nearly everything in translation.";

	schema:headline " Mediocre film based on a literary masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "That's very true this film's redeeming quality if any are the dialogues and also narrator's voiceovers which have been taken verbatim from Pan Tadeusz the Polish 19th century verse epic by Adam Mickiewicz. Mickiewicz was an excellent poet one of the strongest in Polish language and of decent standing in European literature of 19th century and Pan Tadeusz written in 1834 is one of his peak works. The text written in syllabotonic rhymed verse is at time funny at times touching but always flowing and vibrant. The epic tells a story from the lives of Polish lesser gentry in eastern part of the former Commonwealth of Poland these parts are now in Lithuania or Byelarus in the times of Napoleon's conquests. The plot includes a little bit of love story a little bit of war skirmishes really mystery intrigue resistance against Poland's occupiers scenes of everyday life  all with a good measure of nostalgia thrown in as it was written by Mickiewicz as emigree in Paris with the patriotic goal to cheer up literally in Polish to strengthen the hearts of other emigrees and of Poles in the partitioned and nonexisting Poland at the time shortly after yet another unsuccessful uprising against the Russian Empire.Pan Tadeusz the movie is a costume drama directed by Andrzej Wajda the Polish director with some notable previous work under his belt. Into this film he brings mainly his experience and routine as filmmaker. The acting with few exceptions fails to impress the actors simply mill around and recite the splendid lines by Mickiewicz. The camerawork is passable with some nice shots of the beautiful locations. Also scenography and costumes are decent. What stands out is the music by the renowned Wojciech Kilar. But then again it is standing out against the backdrop of a frankly not very exciting movie.All in all the most interesting feature of this film is unfortunately lost in translation from rhymed verse in 19th century Polish.".

Just about throughout the whole movie this Telemina wears about the lowest cut dress she can get away with. Even worse in one scene the camera zooms in on her bosom to emphasize the lust of Tadeusz and her seductive dress. Here is a woman who is old enough to be his mother. Then this Tadeusz dumps her for the much younger 14 year old! Zosia and goes off and marries her in the end. As a PolishAmerican I am embarrassed that this is the best that an epic poem by Adam Mickiewicz can produce assuming that the movie is faithful to the book. The family feud is an embarrassment also where the Warden had nothing on his mind but rage and revenge for the Slopica family. This feud leads to almost bloodshed but later there is bloodshed as the Poles and the Russians mindlessly slaughter each because of an insult to the Major of the Russian troops.

	schema:reviewBody "I can see why some of you would turn this off pretty quickly. Midnight Movie obviously was not blessed with a big budget or the best actors. A couple of time in the beginning the thought Oh man I think I may have wasted my money on this one ran through my head. With nothing to lose I continued to watch the film and slowly but surely was won over by the spirit of this film.The premise of the film itself is somewhat original. After a director of an old low budget cult film becomes dangerously obsessed with his film he is locked up in an insane asylum and is forced to watch his film on the idea that him watching this may somehow relax his growing obsession. He disappears in a bloodbath and all the remaining people left in the asylum are slaughtered.Several years later the film is shown again at an Indy move theater in a small town. Convinced that the missing director will show the two police officers wait patiently while the movie begins to play. As the small crowd in the theater and the few workers start showing up in the scenes and being brutally murdered the crowd quickly finds out that this is no ordinary movie.There are as with most current low budget slashers several problems within this film.

	onyx:emotionText "I can see why some of you would turn this off pretty quickly. Midnight Movie obviously was not blessed with a big budget or the best actors. A couple of time in the beginning the thought Oh man I think I may have wasted my money on this one ran through my head. With nothing to lose I continued to watch the film and slowly but surely was won over by the spirit of this film.The premise of the film itself is somewhat original. After a director of an old low budget cult film becomes dangerously obsessed with his film he is locked up in an insane asylum and is forced to watch his film on the idea that him watching this may somehow relax his growing obsession. He disappears in a bloodbath and all the remaining people left in the asylum are slaughtered.Several years later the film is shown again at an Indy move theater in a small town. Convinced that the missing director will show the two police officers wait patiently while the movie begins to play. As the small crowd in the theater and the few workers start showing up in the scenes and being brutally murdered the crowd quickly finds out that this is no ordinary movie.There are as with most current low budget slashers several problems within this film. However most of them seem to stem from the budget and I really felt that this film was directed and ultimately done the best possible way considering the low budget and the range of the talent.

	schema:headline " Pretty Solid 80's style Slasher!";
	schema:reviewBody "Midnight Movie is the type of movie that I love to come across because it seems to rare these days to find a movie like it. First it is a pure slasher flick through and through. There is no tongueincheek horror or comedic undertones that seem so prevalent in a lot of today's horror. More importantly it plays out like a 80's slasher film and captures the spirit and essence of 80's style horror perfectly.The film centers around the first showing of a horror film called The Dark Beneath since several people were murdered while watching the film. Only a handful of people show up for the showing including the boyfriend and a couple friends of the highschool aged theater manager a redneck motorcycle riding couple and a couple of cops who think the film's director may show up to cause some trouble. The film shown on screen is a 70's style Texas Chainsaw Massacre type film about a group of friends who experience car trouble and seek help at creepy farmhouse only to be butchered by a killer in a creepy mask whose weapon of choice is a sharp spiral tool. Somehow though the killer is able to transfer himself out of the screen and begins stalking and killing the moviegoers.The Good The film looks great. It is competently directed and in lesser hands the whole moviewithinamovie element could have been a real mess. The killer is pretty cool as well and definitely reminded me of a Michael Myers Jason or Leatherface type killer. My only qualm with him is the weapon of choice which does manage some good kill scenes but becomes boring repetitive and not at all intimidating. As I mentionedthe film really has the classic slasher vibe going on and is quite effective. Once the action gets going it is truly a fun ride and doesn't let up until the last frame. There are also some surprises in who livesdies that took me by surprise which is always a good thing in a slasher because generally they are so predictable with who livesdies. Though it initially turned me off I actually ended liking that there were so few characters in the film because it allowed us to get to know each of them a tad more. I was actually upset to see a couple of them get offed.The Bad The acting is a mixed bag. I know it is nitpicky but the film REALLY could have done WITHOUT the younger brother character. First the kid is a bad actor second his presence serves absolutely zero purpose and actually becomes a distraction to the plot. There is also no real backstory to the killer and whyhow he is able to come out of the screen and kill in real life. Some parts were indeed cheesy particularly the opening scene with the film's director in a mental institution.Overall this is a decent horror film and certainly one of the better DTV slashers I have seen in awhile. Everything about the film looks great and it is always refreshing to see a contemporary slasher film successfully pay homage to early genre films.My Grade B".

Those in the cinema will understand the characters' dilemma all too well as they become prey to the killer who seemingly has the ability to remove himself from the film into reality stalking them following their fear he has a nose for this emotion. When the victims fall to the stalking supernatural killer their bodies are carried into the film and into his dungeon of rooms a veritable prison for those whose fear he cashed in on.Rebekah Brandes is Bridget the young manager of the theater who takes care of her brother TimmyJustin Baricboth were a victim of fatherly abuse so their emotional wounds are still rather fresh. Daniel Bonjour is Bridget's very honorable and courageous boyfriend Josh who comes to her aid as protector when the situation grows more and more terrifying and the death toll ratchets upward. Greg Circulnick is Josh's obnoxious buddy Mario and we see how much of a cowardly jerk he is when the killer has his girlfriend SamanthaMandell Maughantrapped with her hands pinned in a window seal. Jon Briddell is Detective Barrons at the midnight screening in the hopes that it's creator might show up. Michael Swan is Dr. Wayne the one who witnessed how bloody his hospital was at the hands of an escaped patient and hopes that the lunatic will return to the theater where his film is playing. Also attending the show is a biker couple HarleyStan Ellsworthand BabeMelissa Steachwho are annoyed at the teen audience for talking during the movie. Rounding out the cast Brea Grant as Rachel the candypopcorn counter girl with a lousy attitude Shaun Ausmus as Kenny wishing to improve his status in the theater begging for Bridget to allow him managerial duties so that he can show how responsible he can be and Michael Schwartz as Sully an opinionated hangeron who wishes to join his teen peers and instead causes much disturbance when his body doesn't react too well to the popcorn and raisins. Arthur Roberts has a chameo role as the escaped crazy who made The Dark Beneath quite memorable in his brief screen time.Surprisingly brutal supernatural slasher with a sadistic killer who buries his corkscrew weapon deep into the bellies of victims. One victim gets the blade slammed into his face while another receives it into her back shoulder as the killer twists it ripping deep inside. Brandes is quite a cute little lead actress establishing pretty much right away that she's sensitive and guarded due to past trauma and Bonjour's Josh is exactly who she needs a person sympathetic towards her..Bonjour has that kind of knight in shining armour role. Ellsworth is fun as foulmouthed hulking Harley and his gal is the very sexy Steach..her screen name Babe is quite appropriate who stands by her man always no matter how inappropriate his behavior can be at times..ultimately though Harley has a heart revealed when he finds out what Bridget has been through upon seeing scars on her arm..he is certainly someone you'd like to have on your side if being chased by a maniac. I think if you dwell on the film's wacky plot determining logic then this will be certain to alienate you..it's more for slasher fans anyway who can dispense with logic embracing the loving nod to psychothrillers which appeared in Grindhouses. The killer's look is really effective as is his weapon. The killer often dissolves in and out of reality returning to the film to assault the characters. The theater setting has an ungarnished archaic look representing a relic on it's way to being condemned. I'm not sure anyone will find the film on screen..where the killer comes out ofa realistic example of 70's exploitation however. Startlingly grim conclusion.".

	schema:reviewBody "When a violent '70s horror film is screened at a midnight showing in a smalltown movie theatre a group of friends decide to give the classic cult film a shot. Unfortunately for them something sinister is afoot when it seems the movie's killer escapes from the celluloid and into their world looking to make them the stars of the very film they were just watching!While the plot may have been pulled directly out of the Are You Afraid of the Dark? episode The Tale of the Midnight Madness with a overalled murderer swapped for Nosferatu it still seemed like an inventive and interesting idea that could easily make for an entertaining modern slasher. I suppose all three of those traits inventiveinterestingentertaining are true. But it still wasn't a great film. For some strange reason and this rarely happens but I just kept bursting into laughter throughout the movie especially within the first twenty minutes or so. I think it was a strange reaction to the bad acting cheesy dialogue and that tickettaker kid that would not stop smiling every time he was on screen. Sadly however those are the kinds of a laughs a filmmaker does NOT want for his film. They're the ones that are laughing at not with. Anyway as far as the rest of the film goes it's all pretty subpar. Visually it's nothing to compliment. The direction  cinematography are all pretty basic taking no risks whatsoever. The editing is terrible using tricks like that annoying MTVstyle editing just to add some style. The acting as I hinted at was pretty bad for the most part but it was watchable. The writing was probably the worst part. Not only was the dialogue extremely silly at times but the story often made no sense and had plot holes you could drive a bus through for example how could two people the cop  the doctor who are obsessed with a movie and its director not notice that there are new 'scenes' spliced in with locations  actors that they've never seen before?. There are littletono scares or suspense. . . but the gore is good for the most part even though the kills are overly repetitive. The killer is well somewhat cool somewhat lame. The Keyser Sze limp is never explained or mentioned to have any significance to the film but he does have a cool weapon and mask. My only problem with him. . . the dude's like 5'5 130 lbs. While it does help with the mystery to keep him small it doesn't help with the scares. In the end Midnight Movie comes in just under average in quality but makes up for it in entertainment. It's just far too stupid to really consider anything very good. If all you want is a bit of gore with no real redeeming technical qualities you can do worse.Obligatory Horror ElementsSubgenre SlasherViolenceGore It starts out rather tame with most of the gore  violence offscreen but as the film progresses it does get a bit bloody with some rather cool kills.SexNudity No sex and only a brief topless shower scene. Unfortunate as there are some very cute girls in it.ScaresSuspense Like most slashers of this type the goal was entertainment and jump scares. It did have a few of the latter so I suppose it was a success there.Mystery It tried and threw in a couple red herrings but I didn't really care enough to wonder.  Final verdict 410. Pass on this one unless a little bit of watchability is your only goal.AP3".

The editing is terrible using tricks like that annoying MTVstyle editing just to add some style. The acting as I hinted at was pretty bad for the most part but it was watchable. The writing was probably the worst part. Not only was the dialogue extremely silly at times but the story often made no sense and had plot holes you could drive a bus through for example how could two people the cop  the doctor who are obsessed with a movie and its director not notice that there are new 'scenes' spliced in with locations  actors that they've never seen before?. There are littletono scares or suspense. . . but the gore is good for the most part even though the kills are overly repetitive. The killer is well somewhat cool somewhat lame. The Keyser Sze limp is never explained or mentioned to have any significance to the film but he does have a cool weapon and mask. My only problem with him. . . the dude's like 5'5 130 lbs. While it does help with the mystery to keep him small it doesn't help with the scares. In the end Midnight Movie comes in just under average in quality but makes up for it in entertainment. It's just far too stupid to really consider anything very good. If all you want is a bit of gore with no real redeeming technical qualities you can do worse.Obligatory Horror ElementsSubgenre SlasherViolenceGore It starts out rather tame with most of the gore  violence offscreen but as the film progresses it does get a bit bloody with some rather cool kills.SexNudity No sex and only a brief topless shower scene. Unfortunate as there are some very cute girls in it.ScaresSuspense Like most slashers of this type the goal was entertainment and jump scares. It did have a few of the latter so I suppose it was a success there.Mystery It tried and threw in a couple red herrings but I didn't really care enough to wonder.  Final verdict 410. Pass on this one unless a little bit of watchability is your only goal.AP3";

	schema:reviewBody "Midnight Movie is an absolute blast of a slasher and has a lot going on for it.SPOILERSPreparing for a movie showing Bridget Rebekah Brandes Rachael Brea Grant and Kenny Shawn Ausmus get the theater ready for a showing of a cult horror movie that hasn't been screened in years. Letting in patrons her brother Timmy Justin Baric friends Mario Greg Cirulnick Samantha Mandell Maughan Josh Daniel Bonjour and Sully Michael Schwartz as well as horror fans Harley Stan Ellsworth and Babe Melissa Steach they settle down to watch the movie with all of them enjoying the film. When they start to notice each other dying off in the movie they realize that the killer from the movie is in the theater with them killing them onebyone using their fear of him to track them down. Realizing a way to stop him they band together to find a way out of the theater alive.The Good News There was a lot to like about this one. One of the best features is that it manages to feature one of the more original concepts in the genre and works in plenty to make it feel unique and creative. While the basic premise about a killer stalking theatergoers during a horrormoviemarathon isn't that new this one goes about it brilliantly by having the killer be the physical manifestation of the one from the movie using supernatural powers to stalk them inside the theater overall making it different enough to stand out. This makes the stalking to this one quite nice which is a good plus as there's some really fantastic ones here. The early ones where it shows the killer stalking the people in the theater as the film the patrons are watching are absolutely fantastic with almost nothing wrong with them aside from the blackwhite hampering the view but even still these are great fun. The backtalk as they comment on the situation unknowingly at first but once it gets longer and extended a little more this one has a really great air about it because of these scenes and the revelation by the cast make it all the more fun. Other stalking including those through the theater's surprisingly long darkened twisting hallways are really wellhandled as well making for a series of surprisingly suspenseful stalking sequences. The scene in the basement is superb for it's creepy atmosphere and complete inability to know what's going on while those that prefer more visceral stuff can find the encounter in the main hallway or the chase into the control booth which both come complete with standout kills to spice them up as well. In general this one has just a lot of fun stalking scenes and all are pretty much enjoyable beyond those mentioned here. Also quite fun is the killer's appearance which is quite unique and slightly chilling at first glance. With the skeletal upperhalf mixed with a strange mask over the jaw that meshes with the teeth leaving a distinct impression when combined with the spectacular killing tool in a handdrill this is an imposing killer. There's also a ton of fun to be had with it's kills which are messy and brutal and just perfect for the type of film. From the drill being repeatedly rammed through the stomach of one victim enough to the point of penetrating out the back so as to impale in the back the victim behind a slit throat being sliced to shreds a scythe in the back numerous impaling in various body parts and one who has the drill thrown into the eyeball this one is pretty gory and messy at times. The last plus here is the furious pace which is just outstanding and doesn't have anything wrong with all going by at the proper tempo to never get boring or cutshort it's good stuff. This one is an outstanding slasher film.The Bad News There wasn't that much really wrong with this one. One of the flaws is the fact that this one really doesn't have it's rules for the killer set in stone resulting in some plot holes or just plain confusing scenes. This is incredibly predominant in the finale which has a lot of these scenes where the killer bends it's own rules merely for the sake of giving a scare or attacking a victim making the scenes really actionpacked but lacking logic which can be found only when thought about though. It's a sign for the film that it doesn't make you aware of that but it's still noticeable. The only other part here that doesn't work is the film's length which is a big problem. This one here barely lasts eighty minutes including credits and it tends to just drop out immediately when it could've gone on for a little bit longer which would've helped in explaining the finale a bit more. These here are what's wrong with this one.The Final Verdict An incredibly enjoyable and entertaining entry with very few flaws and much more and more worthwhile good points to easily counteract them. Hardily recommended to fans of 80s slashers slashers in general or those who are interested while there isn't a whole lot who won't find something good here.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language and Brief Nudity".

	schema:reviewBody "It's 'count the clich' time with Midnight Movie a derivative supernatural slasher which looks and feels just like any one of a hundred other films you might find clogging up the horror section in your local rental outlet.Undemanding teen audiences may possibly enjoy this film's easyontheeye cast MTVstyle editing and some unexceptional gore but seasoned horror fans will no doubt find themselves rolling their eyes and groaning in disbelief at what amounts to nothing more than yet another admittedlyslickbuttotallylogicfree piece of popcorn horror packed with cookiecutter characters cheap scares unanswered questions and glaring plotholes.The story for what it's worth goes something like this five years after horror director Ted Radford disappears from a lunatic asylum leaving 70 dead in his wake a cinema decides to present a midnight screening of his cult movie The Dark Beneath. Before you can say 'surely Radford doesn't emerge from his film to kill members of the staff and audience' Radford emerges from the film to kill members of the staff and audience. Yawn!Glossing over such trivial details as exactly how the director achieves his magical return to life and why he is so obsessed with scaring people in the first place the weak script concentrates instead on presenting a myriad of predictable scenes in which the scared occupants of the cinema at first attempt to escape but then begin to fight back.Midnight Movie hits a 'clich alltimehigh' when it is revealed that the killera bargainbasement Leatherface wannabe armed with a custombuilt corkscrewcan only hurt those who are afraid of him gack!. At this point the script becomes completely nonsensical with final survivor Bridget Rebekah Brandes drawing on past painful experiences to help her overcome her fear and trying to save her brother from within the movie.Go see this if your idea of a good horror film is a Saw sequel or a remake of something 'old'. You'll probably enjoy it.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's 'count the clich' time with Midnight Movie a derivative supernatural slasher which looks and feels just like any one of a hundred other films you might find clogging up the horror section in your local rental outlet.Undemanding teen audiences may possibly enjoy this film's easyontheeye cast MTVstyle editing and some unexceptional gore but seasoned horror fans will no doubt find themselves rolling their eyes and groaning in disbelief at what amounts to nothing more than yet another admittedlyslickbuttotallylogicfree piece of popcorn horror packed with cookiecutter characters cheap scares unanswered questions and glaring plotholes.The story for what it's worth goes something like this five years after horror director Ted Radford disappears from a lunatic asylum leaving 70 dead in his wake a cinema decides to present a midnight screening of his cult movie The Dark Beneath. Before you can say 'surely Radford doesn't emerge from his film to kill members of the staff and audience' Radford emerges from the film to kill members of the staff and audience. Yawn!Glossing over such trivial details as exactly how the director achieves his magical return to life and why he is so obsessed with scaring people in the first place the weak script concentrates instead on presenting a myriad of predictable scenes in which the scared occupants of the cinema at first attempt to escape but then begin to fight back.Midnight Movie hits a 'clich alltimehigh' when it is revealed that the killera bargainbasement Leatherface wannabe armed with a custombuilt corkscrewcan only hurt those who are afraid of him gack!. At this point the script becomes completely nonsensical with final survivor Bridget Rebekah Brandes drawing on past painful experiences to help her overcome her fear and trying to save her brother from within the movie.Go see this if your idea of a good horror film is a Saw sequel or a remake of something 'old'. You'll probably enjoy it.";

High Voltage teams the two of them as they're stuck in an abandoned church during a blizzard in the High Sierras.Lombard is a fugitive going back with Detective Owen Moore to face trial and imprisonment on a bus which would today just qualify as a van. Two other passengers are young bride Diane Ellis and banker Phillips Smalley. Driver Billy Bevan rather stupidly decides to push on and gets stuck in the snow drifts. Fortunately there's a church isolated out there that they can see and they make for it for shelter.Where they find it's already occupied by William Boyd who is far from the cowboy hero of Hopalong Cassidy. In fact Boyd is a wanted fugitive and he's got a cache of food for himself alone and he's not looking for company to share it. Of course being stuck the way they are nature takes its course and Lombard finds a way to melt poor Boyd in all that snow.For a film entitled High Voltage not much electricity was being generated from the team of Lombard and Boyd. It looked to me like the whole cast was a bit nervous of the new sound motion pictures. Phillips Smalley in a voice that might have been dubbed sings a lyric tenor number to keep the group entertained and Billy Bevan who was a music hall entertainer in his native Australia as well as the United Kingdom did a couple of numbers as well on the church piano. They were the highlights of the film.Fans of Carole Lombard might want to check this out to see her in a very early sound film and Hoppy fans might want to see Bill Boyd in another role but High Voltage should not generate too much interest elsewhere.".

They were the highlights of the film.Fans of Carole Lombard might want to check this out to see her in a very early sound film and Hoppy fans might want to see Bill Boyd in another role but High Voltage should not generate too much interest elsewhere.";

	schema:reviewBody "By today's standards of course HIGH VOLTAGE with Carole Lombard and Bill Hoppy Boyd would hardly qualify as more than a horribly campy Cmovie. The acting is hammy the plot is sluggish the cinematography is primitive and the ending is inane. Worse yet it contains a grayish atmosphere that's depressing. Some 76 years ago though HIGH VOLTAGE must've thrilled the audiences. It served as a stepping stone in the film industry's transition from producing silents to making talkies. From a historical perspective therefore it possessed an importance that modern viewers have ignored. The acting itself reflected that transition. Everyone was still relying on exaggerated expressions and stagy gestures to communicate to the audience. The original sound system consisted of transcriptions which the projectionist played like gramophone recordings. Because the microphones of that era lacked range and sensitivity the actors had to congregate around hidden ones and shout their lines which eliminated most of the naturalness in delivery and performance that we have grown through the decades to expect. I strongly suspect that prerecorded dialogue and sound effects generated most of the noise in the true outside scenes. To say the least too the script reflected the newness of creating a fulllength feature. It had so many dead spots that I could almost envision where the message boards of a typical silent belonged. Another clue to its antiquity was the absurd ending. If HIGH VOLTAGE had been a modern movie both the criminal characters played by Boyd and Lombard would have fled to freedom as soon as the opportunity surfaced. Along the way the snow and cold might have killed them but that would not have been a chief concern of such supposedly hardened felons. Back then however moral conduct played a more important role even among the bad guys and gals. Another significant difference was the lack of sex profanity and drugs. If produced within these last thirty years Boyd would have found a means of teaching Lombard the real meaning of Hoppy Carol's vocabulary would have made a Marine blush and The Kid would have spent much of the story blowing dope. HIGH VOLTAGE may not be a historical piece but it is definitely a piece of history!".

Milton Hendrickson a rich banker Phillips Smalley who feels money can buy him anything and a bus driver Billy Bevan who constantly refrains Please Paaaleaze.

In spite of an interesting premise the movie is hampered by bad dialog that at times is laughable and at 63 minutes the film seems a lot longer that what it is. William Boyd the cinema's future cowboy matine Hopalong Cassidy and Carole Lombard billed Carol the future screwball comedienne in such classics as MY MAN GODFREY 1936 and NOTHING SACRED 1937 are both effective as the tough guy and gal but in spite of their presence they can't seem to rise above inferior material. Other low points include Owen Moore passing the time singing an Irish song or two by the church organ. There are times in which the movie suffers from some distorted sound recording especially during the outdoor scenes when the passengers walk about to get exercise throwing snow balls at each other and finding The Kid suddenly falling through the ice etc. the latter being one of the few scenes to perk up some excitement.Distributed to home video in the early 1980s and later onto the DVD format HIGH VOLTAGE formerly broadcast on outofservice cable stations as Tempo Television 1988 and Channel America 199091 is a public domain title recommended for lovers of bad cinema or to film buffs interested in this only as a curio especially when a very young and unrecognizable Carole Lombard is concerned.

I guess his hokey folksy voice went a long way in his future career as Hopalong but I must say that I was bowled over by his assured performance and his naturalistic style which for the late twenties was a breath of fresh air.

The sound techniques and equipment were very primitive and as a result many DVDs are practically unwatchable unless they have closed captions or DVD captions. Unfortunately as I saw this film on an Alpha Video DVD a company that specializes in public domain films there were no captions of any typeas they never ever provide captioning or restorations on their films. But fortunately High Voltage did for a 1929 film have exceptionally good sound. While I had to struggle a bit to understand what they were saying it wasn't impossible! Now as for the film I have no idea what the title has to do with the film. After all there is no electricity in the film and it's set in a snow storm!! The film begins with a primitive 1920s style bus getting stranded in a snow storm out West. However the passengers are able to trek to a nearby primitive chapel where they are able to take refuge from the elements. However there is almost no food and the group is concerns they'll either run out of firewood and freeze to death or starve to death because there's no food. Either way things don't look good.The stranded folks consist of two women and four men. One of the women is Carole Lombardwho is being extradited back to New York to serve a prison term. William Boyd a.k.a. 'Hopalong Cassidy' plays the guy who is already taking refuge in the church when everyone arrives. However in a case of an amazing Hollywoodstyle coincidence he too is a wanted man! And wouldn't you know it he and Lombard soon fall in love!! What are the odds?!? Where exactly all this goes is mildly interesting but even for a 63 minute film it seems too talky and slow. Not a horrible film but also no better than a timepasser at best.The worst moments in the filmthe plane that circles in an impossible manner that is obviously a model as well as the singing number that seems to come from out of no where. Notice how the singer has his back turned to the camera the whole timethis is because studios were having a hard time figuring out how to do singing without actually having a live orchestra just off camera playing the music! And so here I assume they just had the guy faking that he's singing while they played a record!".

And sadly it will probably never be released in the state of Gujrat where all this took place. This is a heart rending look at the riots in Gujrat that took place in 2002 in response to a terrorist act in Godhra Gujrat where a train was burned and supposedly hindus were victimised. This film is based on a true story. Not as graphic as you would imagine the film portrays the life of a Parsi family whose son was lost in the riots or may I say organised genocide. The main focus is the family and the loss they suffer as also the apathy or rather the role of the police and the incumbent government in the massacre of thousands of Muslimsnon hindus. The sub plot deals with an American PHD student doing a thesis on Gandhi and his own journey of self realisation dealing with his alcoholism and his painful past. All actors have done a wonderful job. The director himself a Hindu Gujrati has done a wonderful job and kudos to him for fighting all the opposition he probably did face while making this film.".

The Parsi family was perhaps too loving the police officers too brutal the parishad members too crude the music too sentimental the American too stupid and selfrighteous and the neighborhood too harmonious. The characters lacked depth the story lacked layers.But all in all it was an excellent effort. Great performances by Sarika and Naseerudin. And a great and a very bold effort of revealing the truth which was perhaps kept hidden. I just wish that such an important issue was complemented by better film making.

	schema:reviewBody "Parzania is a powerful and heartwrenching movie that is based on a true story about a Parsi It is intriguing how the best of Indian literature and films are based on the Parsis. Parzania perhaps was happenstance but surely not Pestonjee Being Cyrus Such A Long Journey etc. family trapped in the line of fire in the tragic Gujarat riots of 2002. Mr Dholakia certainly deserves all the accolades he has been getting for his sheer courage in choosing to portray this extremely delicate flashpoint episode in India's recent history. The movie is constructed in three acts. In the first the main characters are set up  the happy family of Cyrus comprising himself his wife Shernaz daughter Dilshad and son Parzan the disillusioned American studying Gandhi and the rest of the residents of the Muslimdominated chawl including the sole Hindu family that lives in harmony with the others. In the second act we see elements of brief consternation shown in the first act coming together and exploding into the pogrom that comes to wreck the lives of Cyrus and his family. The third act is a soulsearching exercise following the aftermath of the first violent 72 hours leading into the denouement of the NHRC hearing  first the faked exonerating testimonies then the inevitable admission of guilt by a Hindu followed by a pouring forth of searing indictments. The first act is dated and perhaps the subject matter exonerates the lack of creativity but the overdose of the ensemble introducing itself into the movie in brief flashescuts with doses of naive humour made me queasy. The editing could also have done with some.. well editing. But needless to say the powerful pieces of searing human drama follow in the next two acts. Mr Dholakia must be commended till eternity for his decision not to intrude into the story that unrolls slowly with the confrontation between the American and the 'censustakers' and hurtles then on  the kitschy music in the first act dies out to stonecold silence the camera angles are objective and allencompassing and the actors take control of the movie. The third act is a lot like the quiet sea after a deluge  the wreckage and flotsam is unmistakable the cause still lurks within and yet the spite and the rage is painfully bottled up. A final nitpick I had with Mr Dholakia has more to do with the screenplay as such  chiefly the necessity of introducing the American into the story. While it may have been done with the intent to appeal to an overseas audience and that can scarcely be blamed given our own reluctance to admit folly it deserved more treatment  the American's disturbed childhood believe me when I say however that it was not as disturbed and as tragic as I had been led to believe and as I have known of some others his introduction to Gandhi his impotent drunken rage and finally  with a mere sob  the disavowal of liquor and embrace of Gandhian values was somewhat hurried and jarring.Next we come to what really made Parzania work  the actors. Naseeruddin Shah's portrayal as the patriarch and Sarika's role of the mother were two of the most compelling performances I have seen on screen in a very long time. From a veteran of theatre and film like Naseeruddin Shah it should come as no surprise how he played the doting Parsi father of Parzan his 'Tiger' the dutibound cinema projectionist Shernaz's everloving husband and then a distraught and disparaged human being who has been stripped of his dignity his faith in humanity and his mental balance from having failed to protect his family  all to aweinspiring perfection. Sarika's performance then is what is a stunning revelation. Her Shernaz is a woman whose universe is snugly wrapped around her husband and her two bubbly kids and which is mercilessly shorn asunder when the rioting mob invades her chawl and burns it up. Yet she displays phenomenal strength and resolve hiding her anguish in the innermost vestiges of her heart and only once sobbing uncontrollably and even then so as not to add to all that her daughter has been through locking herself in the bathroom. And while her husband has emotionally detached himself from her and Dilshad following the trauma it is she who must be brave and unshakeable for Dilshad. Sarika as Shernaz is easily the strongest essay in that role that I have seen. To add to all that is her ageless poetic iridescent beauty  merely looking at those green eyes are adequate in knowing her joys and her suffering. More than Perzan Dastur's Parzan it is Pear Barsiwala's Dilshad which impressed me most as the adorable young daughter who plays a foil to Parzan during the happy days then comes into her own when she escapes the clutches of the fanatics with her mother. She successfully persuades Shernaz to stay with her instead of going to look for Parzan. The shock is surely indelible but she displays unfathomable pluck in clinging to her innocence and childhood  she still yearns for the day when her brother will come back to her so that she can tie raakhi on his wrist and waits for nine days in tandem with her father a penance of her own in desperation. Corin Nemec as the American that stands by Cyrus and family performs capably but as mentioned earlier is only peripheral to the real drama that unfolds. Raj Zutshi Sheeba Chaddha and others particularly the mother who talks of her daughter being raped and gruesomely murdered at the NHRC deposition embellish Parzania with all their acting prowess.".

No need to say that he has shown great improvement as a director in 'Parzania'. Even though there have been many movies that have depicted the political conflicts between Hindus and Muslims in India that have lead to bloodshed 'Parzania' takes a closer look at the tragedy that happened in Gujarat in 2002.The film deals with a sensitive and poignant issue but perhaps under the wings of a more experienced director 'Parzania' may have been a better film. Many of the scenes before the riot appear Bollywoodish and some of the scenes thereafter appear dramatic enough to interfere when it may have worked better had it been treated with subtlety. The Allan character is poorly written. At first he's portrayed as a caricature hippytourist type who switches to a whiny alcoholic before becoming a dogooder. The writer fails to show a convincing transition. I also don't understand the point of Cyrus's quest which he undertakes in order to find answers. Much of the movie is seen through Cyrus and Shernaz's point of view and those are the parts that worked best. It also helps that the aforementioned roles were played by gifted actors like Naseeruddin Shah and Sarika. Shah downplays Cyrus with lan but it is Sarika who is outstanding. She owns each and every one of her scenes. Parzan Dastur is very likable. Of the supporting cast Raj Zutshi and Sheeba Chaddha are superb.Flawed it may be but 'Parzania' is far from being a bad film. It is worth the watch. Dholakia may not have been the best choice but he took a brave step and perhaps in the future he can tackle such sensitive issues with more skill and thus do more justice to the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is much news in the Indian media about this film the second outing by the director of Kehtaa Hai Dil Baar Baar which apparently was a remake of the notsofunny Ben stiller comedy Meet the Parents. There is also much praise being showered on the director about his 'struggle' to get this movie distributed in India despite the alleged opposition from powerful political forces lobbied by the hindu extremists. While I applaud the director's courage in the face of the apparent opposition this film is an absolute mess.The acting by most of the actors is abysmal unnecessarily melodramatic and contrived. The dialog sounds like it was written by a 5 year old. Naseerudin Shah does bring some gravitas to his role but much as he tries even he cannot save the film from floundering miserably. Especially in the third act which almost put me to sleep. The Gujarat massacres marked some of the darkest periods in India's recent history and perhaps forever polarized an already troubled nation. To tell that important story requires serious and mature filmmaking. This film is anything but.The character of the drunk foulmouth American lends nothing substantial to the story and seems to be there for no reason except to be the stereotypical disillusioned gora read gringo trying to seek some answers in Gandhi's India. Is this the directors way of pandering to the deep Indian insecurities of wanting desperately to be important on the world stage? Perhaps.Most of the characters are flat and two dimensional. The child actors are the worst. What was with all that skipping down the street ala wizard of oz? Where do you actually see kids doing that expect maybe in those laughingly cheesy family movies from the 50s! Lassie anyone? Using English as the primary language of the film makes little sense since you just cannot take the characters seriously. They come off as forced and stilted. For no reason some characters lapse into Gujarati and Hindi as well making the director's intentions even more muddled. There are other deep flaws in the script. Why that moonshiner and pimp suddenly discover morality and enormous courage to turn on the hindu nationalists and the police at the end is still quite a mystery. Perhaps it was the incredibly asinine expression on his nephews face as he tore off the pinups on his walls and he just couldn't live with that anymore. I am not sure how the director lived through shooting that or those clownishly squirmy looks on the faces of the cops at the hearing. I have seen high school specials that seem like high art compared to the acting I saw in this piece of garbage.

	onyx:emotionText "There is much news in the Indian media about this film the second outing by the director of Kehtaa Hai Dil Baar Baar which apparently was a remake of the notsofunny Ben stiller comedy Meet the Parents. There is also much praise being showered on the director about his 'struggle' to get this movie distributed in India despite the alleged opposition from powerful political forces lobbied by the hindu extremists. While I applaud the director's courage in the face of the apparent opposition this film is an absolute mess.The acting by most of the actors is abysmal unnecessarily melodramatic and contrived. The dialog sounds like it was written by a 5 year old. Naseerudin Shah does bring some gravitas to his role but much as he tries even he cannot save the film from floundering miserably. Especially in the third act which almost put me to sleep. The Gujarat massacres marked some of the darkest periods in India's recent history and perhaps forever polarized an already troubled nation. To tell that important story requires serious and mature filmmaking. This film is anything but.The character of the drunk foulmouth American lends nothing substantial to the story and seems to be there for no reason except to be the stereotypical disillusioned gora read gringo trying to seek some answers in Gandhi's India. Is this the directors way of pandering to the deep Indian insecurities of wanting desperately to be important on the world stage? Perhaps.Most of the characters are flat and two dimensional. The child actors are the worst. What was with all that skipping down the street ala wizard of oz? Where do you actually see kids doing that expect maybe in those laughingly cheesy family movies from the 50s! Lassie anyone? Using English as the primary language of the film makes little sense since you just cannot take the characters seriously. They come off as forced and stilted. For no reason some characters lapse into Gujarati and Hindi as well making the director's intentions even more muddled. There are other deep flaws in the script. Why that moonshiner and pimp suddenly discover morality and enormous courage to turn on the hindu nationalists and the police at the end is still quite a mystery. Perhaps it was the incredibly asinine expression on his nephews face as he tore off the pinups on his walls and he just couldn't live with that anymore. I am not sure how the director lived through shooting that or those clownishly squirmy looks on the faces of the cops at the hearing. I have seen high school specials that seem like high art compared to the acting I saw in this piece of garbage. Even the violence of the riots is too sanitized and I don't mean the lack of blood and gore. This film conjures about as much emotion as a piece of plastic. And don't even get me started on the musical score! Rub your fingers together for the 100 tiny violins playing the sappy music of yore. someone please pass me the aspirin So here is the moral of the story folks Trust not the hype generated by the Indian media and stay as far away from this film as you can.

Especially baffling is Allan's inclusion in the movie he offers no insightful contribution to the movie and his presence seems completely unrealistic. Seriously why is a random white guy narrating a movie that has nothing to do with white people?!? As an American I found it insulting that the producers thought including a white person in that role would make it more appealing in the West.The second problem with the movie was the actual directing. The acting is very poor it is clear that the scenes were filmed in a very broken up manner the dialog unrealistic and the motivations unexplained. The bad guys are literally generic Hindus instead of people with backgrounds and feelings. I think just as interesting as exploring the effect on the city and its people would have been exploring possible reasons behind what happened. Instead all we get is a Hindu man staring out the window staring at some Muslims saying I hate those Muslims while ominous music plays in the background.All in all I give the content of the movie a 610 and the execution a 110. I am happy I saw the movie  mostly because seeing it reenacted on video is a different experience than reading eyewitness accounts  but I cannot recommend the movie to anyone but those who are very interested in the 2002 riots.".

Cinematically speaking. Parzania is a good piece of work...Now parzania is also not easily accessible to our 'innocent' Indian audience because of 'n' reasons.

	schema:reviewBody "The manner in which the film was chronographed was somewhat unique. In real time the main character Morlar is comatized by severe head trauma. In fact the movie opens with his attempted murder. The unfolding of events in the ensuing investigation are presented with smooth transitions from flashback to present in order to create a sense of fatalistic inevitability. The director takes a very difficult path to achieve this but I think he pulled it off very effectively. Look for little tricks to smooth out the staccato chronological transitions. Small similarities between outgoing and incoming scenes create a more seamless effect.Also the sounds of a former scene would linger for a couple of seconds after the transition further uniting past  present to emphasize the inevitable hopelessness of the inspectors situation. It also serves to demonstrate Morlar's indomitable fatalistic will.All the characters are well and cleverlycast particularly Richard Burton as Morlar. VonGreenway's book comments on the intensity of Morlar's character and his riveting gaze. Burton was obviously intimately familiar with the text as his rendition of Morlar is to say the least riveting.The apocryphal elements added by the director the cataclysmic disasters vastly improve the story's bigscreen appeal even if they were a bit of a departure from the text. The director simplifies the text by only indirectly referring to Morlar's political agenda. To follow the text in this would be setting up an entirely different story and would distract from the immediacy of the peril Morlar represents for the inspector and the psychiatrist.The tongue in cheek manner in which these two meet serves to show a comprehensive understanding of the text it gives clear notice to those familiar with the book the text cannot realistically be followed in every way. I'm sorry I was expecting a man. the inspector explains his reaction to her. That's alright I was expecting an English Inspector. She responds. This of course was a reference to the characters as they appeared in the book.This is a well directed film making sense of a difficult text in an acceptable time frame. Richard Burton was an excellent choice as Morlar he has a dominating presence that lends well to the character. These things along with an excellent rendition of a sensational compelling story make the Medusa Touch one of the best suspense films ever.".

	onyx:emotionText "The manner in which the film was chronographed was somewhat unique. In real time the main character Morlar is comatized by severe head trauma. In fact the movie opens with his attempted murder. The unfolding of events in the ensuing investigation are presented with smooth transitions from flashback to present in order to create a sense of fatalistic inevitability. The director takes a very difficult path to achieve this but I think he pulled it off very effectively. Look for little tricks to smooth out the staccato chronological transitions. Small similarities between outgoing and incoming scenes create a more seamless effect.Also the sounds of a former scene would linger for a couple of seconds after the transition further uniting past  present to emphasize the inevitable hopelessness of the inspectors situation. It also serves to demonstrate Morlar's indomitable fatalistic will.All the characters are well and cleverlycast particularly Richard Burton as Morlar.

Any attempt to remake this classic would be a travesty.Richard Burton's excellent performance and surly the role fits Burton's acting style like a well tailored glove. Casting him as an intelligent and well versed author whose spoken and written dialog is scripted to delve deep into a profound command of the English language is right up Burton's alley. I see much written here about Burton's outstanding performance and they are certainly correct.It almost seems an oversight however that the performance given by Lino Ventura Inspector Brunel is as fine a work of acting as can be. Officially a 'supporting actor' in the film one could hardly tell. Cast as a French Exchange Detective who has a suspicious slightly nontrusting relationship with his English Scotland Yard counterparts Ventura turns in a nearly flawless role and makes the idea work exquisitely.Often while deep in puzzled thought and shock mere facial expressions from Inspector Brunel are perfect additions to Ventura's role. To many thread do not topic Lino Ventura's excellent acting in this outstanding classic gem of a thriller. Perhaps due to many fans in the English speaking world never having heard of Lino Ventura and figuring he was a 'smallfame' actor. Nothing could be further from the truth. Ventura was Italian citizenship and birth while living the majority of his life in France.Ventura was a hugely acclaimed and decorated actor in France who played some iconic roles there. Casting Lino Ventura in this film was no stretch as his timeless performance attests. The filmmakers were fortunate to land him.

I for one love it  I think that it succeeds and succeeds well both as a thriller and as a horror movie. However it is far from clear to me if the movie succeeds thanks to or in spite of Richard Burton who plays the role of Morlar. It's not even clear to me what Burton is doing  is he acting ? Overacting ? Having some kind of nervous breakdown while acting ? Not acting at all ? Acting so well or so badly that he enters into a new frontier ? In case you're thinking Christ it's easy to write reviews like that I would advise you to watch Mr. Burtons hallucinated performance or nonperformance for yourself. Only one thing can be said with some degree of certainty and that is that he seems to belong in another movie than all the other actors involved. The movie is remarkably faithful to its source material the book of the same name by Peter Van Greenaway. Note however that psychiatrist Zonfeld changes from an ugly man into a beautiful woman. Somehow I don't think there is much of a feminist subtext to this change. The book is well worth ferreting out for its sly wit and satirical flourishes. A small example  when sifting through evidence and questioning witnesses Inspector Cherry sets out to interview Morlar's editor who works in a chaotic and dusty office. There is a halfeaten sandwich resting on a proof copy of Virginia Ruislip's I was Tutankhamun's Mistress...Peter Van Greenaway was good at thinking up deeply original plots and concepts  do check out his other work.For the lovers of trivia  I own a muchbattered copy of The Medusa Touch published by Panther Books in 1975.

I am therefore biased and cannot see this film as anything but great. But I just watched it again now in my middle age and I still found it phenomenal.

The Medusa Touch is a perfect film for Britain in the 1970s  that bleakest of decades subject to mainland bombings loss of national identity union strangleholds decaying estates and governmental corruption on an unprecedented scale. And of course Punk a spiritual ally of John Lydon and Co all Morlar lacks is a dog collar and a safety pin through his nose.1978 had its fair share of neosupernatural and conspiracy thrillers including Magic The Eyes Of Laura Mars the Kaufman remake of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers Boys From Brazil Omen II and Capricorn One  but the complex and very English Medusa Touch doesn't quite belong to either category The Fury probably comes closest with its tale of raging telekinetic twins.As the film opens novelist John Morlar has just had his head bashed in with a figurine of Napoleon by assailants unseen. As he lies hospitalised in a coma with a faltering pulse but a screaming brain EEG it's up to French detective Brunel Ventura to discover whodunnit and why.Through flashbacks we discover the misanthropic Morlar's terrible gift  the ability to kill with his mind. Before the first hour is up he's dispatched his nanny his parents his schoolteacher a high court judge his neighbour and his wife and her lover in steady succession. Branching out into massmurder he sends a jet liner crashing into a skyscraper simply to prove to his sceptical psychiatrist Dr Zonfeld Remick that he can  If you say coincidence to me again I shall drive my fist through your face. As a vindictive aside he also bungsup a manned space flight. But Morlar who's keeping himself alive through sheer willpower is just warming up good as his word  The moment they begin to pray I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads  he crowns a bunch of visiting Commonwealth dignitaries with huge chunks of Westminster Abbey.It's around about now that Brunel starts to believe what we've known all along. Coincidence? Nah. As the film ends Morlar whose very name suggests a cross between a decaying tooth and a subterranean cellardweller falteringly scrawls the name of his next target on a notepad beside his bed Windscale. Ouch.Aside from the cultural anachronisms I was expecting a man! a surprised Brunel tells Doctor Zonfeld and a highlevel conspiracy subplot that goes nowhere The Medusa Touch feels surprisingly fresh even contemporary with its ghastly scene of a jet slamming into a tower block. The wonderful supporting cast including Gordon Jackson Derek Jacobi Harry Andrews and Jeremy Brett least of all cameos Shaw Taylor and Gordon Honeycombe reads like a who's who of British stage and screen.But the fact this hysterical if at times rather plodding melodrama succeeds at all is mostly down to Burton who was having a dry spell at the time but looks like he's woken up in a skip along with the vituperative richness of his dialogue. As the director says it's the sort of stuff Burton eats for breakfast.Morlar's motivation isn't blackmail or revenge  he's just a grumpy old bastard who appeals to the irritable git in all of us. Don't bother me with your middleclass crap he tells a woman soliciting members for her tennis club. Burton's rants are worth the price of admission on their own whether ruminating on the relationship between power and evil To build a cenotaph first choose a million victims or willing his fishwife neighbour to toss herself out of the window.This particular scene is one of the highlights of what is often a blackly comic film. Sighs Brunel on being told of another supporting character's mysterious fate Let me guess...Behindthescenes footage on the 2006 Network DVD edition shows how the film crew 'destroyed' Westminster Abbey without harming a single extra therein. It's 18 minutes of utter dullness. Anyone who's been a film extra will immediately recognise the tedium involved  the sitting around the sudden flurry of activity the sitting around again. Spot the crewmember to the left of shot casually chucking a polystyrene concrete block into the fray. In the audio commentary Stephen Jones recalls horror films being in the dumps when the film first came out which obviously didn't faze director Jack Gold who describes the origins of the film and getting it off the ground. We learn Lee Remick didn't want to do the film initially feeling it was too close to The Omen while screenwriter John Briley who also wrote Gandhi hadn't been crazy about Peter Van Greenaway's original source novel  he had to be talked into it. I'd rather watch this than Gandhi chuckles Kim Newman. Gold reveals Burton was actually off the booze while fiming  He was taking a pill that made you sick when you drank. All three concur that the jet linerintoskyscraper scene is standout This is an astonishingly wellmade film for the 1970s! breathes Jones and Gold describes being in New York during 911 and making a connection My God it's just like The Medusa Touch! Nevertheless It's not a film of my heart the director concedes which momentarily stumps Newman and Jones into silence after all they've just spent over an hourandahalf indulging the man and talking the thing up. No says Gold I've more attachment to my small films for television. But ultimately he thinks It's a good story well told. What more could you ask for?".

The wonderful supporting cast including Gordon Jackson Derek Jacobi Harry Andrews and Jeremy Brett least of all cameos Shaw Taylor and Gordon Honeycombe reads like a who's who of British stage and screen.But the fact this hysterical if at times rather plodding melodrama succeeds at all is mostly down to Burton who was having a dry spell at the time but looks like he's woken up in a skip along with the vituperative richness of his dialogue. As the director says it's the sort of stuff Burton eats for breakfast.Morlar's motivation isn't blackmail or revenge  he's just a grumpy old bastard who appeals to the irritable git in all of us. Don't bother me with your middleclass crap he tells a woman soliciting members for her tennis club. Burton's rants are worth the price of admission on their own whether ruminating on the relationship between power and evil To build a cenotaph first choose a million victims or willing his fishwife neighbour to toss herself out of the window.This particular scene is one of the highlights of what is often a blackly comic film. Sighs Brunel on being told of another supporting character's mysterious fate Let me guess...Behindthescenes footage on the 2006 Network DVD edition shows how the film crew 'destroyed' Westminster Abbey without harming a single extra therein. It's 18 minutes of utter dullness. Anyone who's been a film extra will immediately recognise the tedium involved  the sitting around the sudden flurry of activity the sitting around again. Spot the crewmember to the left of shot casually chucking a polystyrene concrete block into the fray. In the audio commentary Stephen Jones recalls horror films being in the dumps when the film first came out which obviously didn't faze director Jack Gold who describes the origins of the film and getting it off the ground. We learn Lee Remick didn't want to do the film initially feeling it was too close to The Omen while screenwriter John Briley who also wrote Gandhi hadn't been crazy about Peter Van Greenaway's original source novel  he had to be talked into it. I'd rather watch this than Gandhi chuckles Kim Newman. Gold reveals Burton was actually off the booze while fiming  He was taking a pill that made you sick when you drank. All three concur that the jet linerintoskyscraper scene is standout This is an astonishingly wellmade film for the 1970s! breathes Jones and Gold describes being in New York during 911 and making a connection My God it's just like The Medusa Touch! Nevertheless It's not a film of my heart the director concedes which momentarily stumps Newman and Jones into silence after all they've just spent over an hourandahalf indulging the man and talking the thing up. No says Gold I've more attachment to my small films for television. But ultimately he thinks It's a good story well told. What more could you ask for?";

The man who in 1974 nearly drank himself to death suffered from both kidney disease and an enlarged liver at his early death ten years later.The toast of Hollywood in the early 1950's Humphrey Bogart was one of his biggest fans the 1960's saw him as one of the highestpaid movie stars in the world he received a total of six Academy Award nominations. A Socialist and an Atheist with a strong contempt for Capitalists exploiting the poor he even suggested all actors were latent homosexuals.Like so many of his stage and screen roles Richard Burton could be larger than life. So what better part for this man than the starring role in THE MEDUSA TOUCH playing a writer living in horror convinced that he can murder people just by thinking about it!Most critics strongly dismissed this film upon its release in 1978. In retrospect I guess it's easy to see why a movie like this would seem silly almost archaic at the time especially as it was following gritty classics like Deliverance The French Connection Mean Streets Taxi Driver and beautiful spectacles like Close Encounters of the Third Kind.Seen with 21st Century goggles however it's near impossible not to enjoy what is going on here. THE MEDUSA TOUCH starts out with a brutal murder takes on the shape of a police procedural then flirts more and more with the supernatural before moving into possible SciFi territory and finally punching you in the face with scenes of both Action and Horror!Horror in this case meaning closer to Hammer House than it does the cynical US horror movies of the era just so I don't get any angry messages from people who were expecting ROSEMARY'S BABY or THE SHINING.THE MEDUSA TOUCH has plenty of quirks and odd twists along the way even a suicidescene sprinkled with comedy but this just adds to the fun the end result being a movie quite unlike anything else. The movie's finale I found so memorable I wanted to hug the screen but that probably says more about me than anything else! Other people might want to punch the screen and I would pity them for taking their movies so seriously.Italian veteran actor Lino Ventura is a fun choice costarring as the French ! police detective who has to figure out what is real and what's not. The beautiful Lee Remick is also along for the ride as Burton's doctor. The rest of the cast is made up of familiar faces almost like a who's who of British film and television Gordon Jackson Harry Andrews Michael Hordern Derek Jacobi Michael Byrne and the greatest classic Sherlock Holmes in the history of television Jeremy Brett.The highlight of the cast is still Burton though. There is always something about this man's presence that lends extra credence to anything he's in.Compared to similar films THE MEDUSA TOUCH seems somewhat forgotten today. Why this is I'm not sure. Could it be so simple that it followed on the heels of the aforementioned EXORCIST II THE HERETIC? A genre movie so boring it works like a black hole on any nearby piece of celluloid.THE MEDUSA TOUCH is anything but boring. It might be eccentric and throwing in everything but the kitchen sink but just like Richard Burton it is never boring!".

The flashbacks especially some of those to Doctor Zonfeld and the publisher Townley are integrated into the main storyline in an ingenious manner.The last part of the film moves away from police intrigue to telekinesis thriller. While the change from gritty police drama to supernatural fantasy is a little jarring the audience is soon gripped by the new threat and goes along for the ride.The cast is excellent. Richard Burton seems chillingly restrained. Lino Ventura is the perfect choice as a world weary detective who essentially carries the main story  it is too bad they chose to overdub his voice with that of another actor as this seems quite distracting.

As a result one is confused whether the movie is a comedy or an emotional drama. Also the songs keep coming at regular intervals without any need or situation. Not to mention a very mediocre score by Anu Malik and equally bad lyrics by Sameer.As usual like a typical Hindi movie KKKM is not without goofs. One cannot imagine that Rati Agnihotri can own a huge departmental store and still thieves can get away without getting caught in the modern day world of video surveillance cameras and security guards. Or is the police of England so ineffective that it cannot provide security to such huge departmental stores. Also it is ridiculous to see Kajol driving a battle tank right into the parking lot. I wonder when will Indian directors rise from mediocrity and foreignlocations hangups.Performance wise everybody does their parts without any dedication as none of the characters have been given enough justice to develop in movie due to inevitable comedy situation. Only saving grace is Rati Agnihotri who like Sharmila seems very fresh unaffected by age.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm totally disappointed by Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi. Rahul Rawail had directed many movies most of them were not up to the mark but I did like several of his works such as Betaab Anjaam Biwi O Biwi and to an extent Samundar and Arjun Pandit. Here Rawail follows a very old formula a comedy involving twin sisters casting a popular actress to play them. This of course reminds us of classic films like Seeta Aur Geeta a film I can watch even today over and over again and still be totally entertained. But Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi sadly manages to be not more than a corny and formulaic film which is more tiresome rather than entertaining. And it's not specifically because of the twins it's because of the incredibly poor script. The comedy the dialogues the proceedings everything sounds extremely hackneyed. The story lacks focus and conviction it is predictable and forced and even the songs are forgettable. The twin sisters are played by Kajol. She is the only reason I kept watching the movie right until the end but she is let down by the script despite trying her best to build two different persons on screen. Watch the 1998 Tanuja Chandradirected Dushman is which she excelled while playing a double role as well and you'll see how this pales in comparison although Dushman focused more on one sister and was far from a comedy. The less said about Sunil Shetty  the better. Rishi Kapoor is pretty likable as the father and Rati Agnihotri is beautiful and lovely. Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi is unfunny and it's so meaningless that even Kajol can't save it. I assure that you can easily find something to spend your time on something worthier.".

My guess is that the best of them is Drums Along the Mohawk and that was about one of the more obscure theaters of that war.Like Gone With the Wind the Howards of Virginia is taken from a rather sprawling novel. But Gone With the Wind was very faithful to the original and managed to hold interest even given its length. The Howards of Virginia is a condensed version of the novel and some of the characterization has been sacrificed in the screen translation.Nevertheless it's a good story about a fictional Matt Howard from his days as a youth hearing the news about his father's death with Braddock's army in the French and Indian War to just before the Siege at Yorktown. Of course growing up with Thomas Jefferson it's not surprising that Howard develops the opinions he does.Cary Grant is cast against type as Matt Howard. Takes a bit of getting used to in buckskins but I like his characterization. In point of fact if you want to see the real Cary Grant on screen look at None But the Lone Heart Gunga Din or Sylvia Scarlett. That's where you see the real Archie Leach. Cary Grant was the best role Cary Grant ever played.If The Howards of Virginia were made 10 years later Burt Lancaster would have been spoton in terms of casting.Martha Scott is fine as the Tory girl that Cary Grant woos and wins. It's quite a culture shock for her coming to the mostly unsettled Shenandoah valley among Grant's frontier friends and neighbors but her best scenes in the film are at that point.Of course I think both Grant and Scott are acted off the screen when Cedric Hardwicke is on. As Scott's older brother Fleetwood Payton Hardwicke is easily the best in the film. He's a privileged Virginia aristocrat and loyalist supporter of the crown. He's an aristocratic snob to be sure but he's also a tender and loving brother to Martha Scott. Hardwicke managed to capture all the elements in Fleetwood Payton well as well as his losing his mind as his well ordered aristocratic world tumbles down about him.Richard Carlson is very much what I picture as the young Thomas Jefferson full of new ideas and quite the rebel against his own class. Of course Patrick Henry and George Washington make their appearances as well in colonial Virginia. My guess is that in the book a whole lot of familiar names made it there but were not in the screenplay.This is not the American Revolution's Gone With the Wind but taken on its own terms The Howards of Virginia is good entertainment and does capture some of the motivating spirit behind the Virginia patriots and tories.".

Plus the main character's fatherinlaw is a loyalist so the real tensions that existed within families was given decent treatment. As an American History teacher I must point out that despite coming from Hollywood in 1940 the realism in spirit is quite surprising and I could recommend this to kids as they'd learn a lot.It was odd to see Cary Grant as a bit of a ragtag outdoorsman but he carried it off better than I'd expected. Plus his British accent really wouldn't have been out of place in the Colonies at that time.Another big plus for the film was the relationship between Grant and his sons. Yes it's a bit manipulative but I really liked the way the writers dealt with this relationship in the movie. All in all an excellent film.".

Except for a couple of well played scenes with his sons TOM DRAKE and PHIL TAYLOR Grant's performance is way too broad to be acceptable as part of a serious historical epic.Director Frank Lloyd never once tones down Grant's performance and lets the hyperactive Grant overact at any given moment in a role he clearly doesn't know how to play. At least we do get more restrained work from MARTHA SCOTT as Grant's aristocratic wife and SIR CEDRIC HARDWICKE as her snobbish brother who sides with the British during the Revolutionary War period.Obviously a lot of expense went into creating the right atmosphere for this story of the turmoil surrounding America's independence among the colonies and there are times when you wish even more had been spent to produce the film in the gorgeous Technicolor of that era. But the script is a weak one never able to maintain the sort of interest it should have had over a running time of two hours.The banal dialog that closes the film is about as jingoistic as you can get and enough to make anyone wince. The story was probably chosen because the producers hoped to make another DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK or GONE WITH THE WINDbut they failed utterly to do so.Summing up Sad to see Grant so badly miscast and not given proper direction.".

The wrong elements of the plot are emphasized and the character of Matthew Howard is less a complicated man than a simple cypher.It's not a bad movie by any means but it looks like it's trying desperately to copy A Tale of Two Cities and Gone with the Wind at the same time.

	schema:reviewBody "Sad that so many Cary Grant fans had their bubbles burst. It certainly was strange to see him play such a character but did anyone have any problems with the actors who played the other backwoodsmen? Grant could not have played his dapper persona while being from the Shenandoah Valley especially in scenes with those crude and embarrassing frontiersmen and women. They must have been extras. I doubt if that kind of acting is taught at UCLA or Princeton. One reviewer was critical of the director because the irony of Matthew Howard turning into a kind of Fleetwood Peyton was not portrayed. But from early on in the movie Tom Jefferson and Matt Howard thought it would be grand to develop the 1000 acres in the Shenandoah Valley into a PLANTATION. That was the American Dream to achieve success through hard work. Then it meant that the most successful planter had slaves and went to Congress. But Matt Howard didn't want to run at first and when pressed said he would go if only to improve the roads and bridges and repeal the Stamp Act. He had no thoughts of aristocratic power unlike Fleetwood.Anyone see John Wayne in The Searchers? Early in the film he wanted to murder his niece Natalie Wood because she was kidnapped and lived with the Redskins. He too was playing a character from an earlier time when there were other mores.Talk about provincialism! It's thriving even today.Collectivism versus individualism is being played out today on these movie reviews. Am I being too critical to suggest that those who are most critical of this move are doing so on political rather than on artistic grounds?July 4 2009I watched the film again this year on TV. It's becoming an Independence Day don't call it the 4th of July classic something like Jimmy Stewart's the 25th of December classic It's a Wonderful Life.I can't answer all the other reviewers individually here. Basically I suspect that the Cary Grant as Matt Howard detractors are either in love with the suave Cary Grant or are against the political principles of Matt Howard. His performance in the beginning as a backwoodsman was energetic and realistic. He pulled no punches. The depiction of his friends as toothless and illiterate and his love and respect for them was outstanding. His speechifying at the conclusion espousing the distinctly American virtues of freedom selfreliance and industriousness sounded heartfelt. I don't know what Cary Grant felt later about the film but the film is essential now both as a political debate and a period piece. Read the reviews at the Cary Grant web site some of them written when the film came out in 1940 when we were allied with England in WW II. Think about today's political climate what with teapartyers the original Boston Tea party was referred to in the movie and the current debate on levels of taxation and government controls the Stamp Act was also a plot element in the movie. Also in case there's some doubt Cary Grant wasn't always perfectly elegant. Early in his career he played a heavy. In a string of films he had supporting parts including the heavy who nearly destroys Marlene Dietrich in Blonde Venus 1932 and Mae West's foil in She Done Him Wrong 1933 and I'm No Angel 1933. Later in his career after he had established his elegant style he played in a couple lessthanexemplary roles costarring with Jayne Mansfield in 1957 in Kiss Them for Me and playing a heartless swindler and a Cockney in 1943 in Mr Lucky. I don't see why he can't play against type in this patriotic film. Maybe he was still trying to establish his bona fides as an actor or he could have believed in the principles of Matt Howard. In support of the second theory Cary Grant became an American citizen on June 26th 1942. Might not he actually believed the lines he was reading because that is what they were teaching our naturalized citizens in those days?July 4 2010".

Many people felt that Cary Grant was not suited for his role in this film and felt he should have turned down this role. There are great supporting actors in this film which are Martha Scott Jane Peyton Howard and Cary Grant  Matt Howard and also Cedric HardwickeFleetwood Peyton. This film deals with the Boston Tea Party which means that the British were enacting a tax on the people of Boston and the people of Boston were very rebellious against such legislation and made the statement No Representation with out Taxitation.

	schema:headline " Underrated film...superb performance by Martha Scott";
	schema:reviewBody "I like to think of this film as Cary Grant forgetting the Cary Grant he was turning himself into...and just acting. Beginning with Topper he was developing the Cary Grant persona and it showed up in 8 films before this one. But here he doesn't play himself at all. He plays the character Matt Howard.I'm surprised when I see what a low rating this film gets by IMDb reviewers. I think the reason perhaps is that if you are expecting the suave and sophisticated Cary Grant well you're going to be disappointed. Instead Grant portrays a rather backwoods oaf who does mature as time passes.My main gripe about the film is that it takes place in Virginia where I lived for over two decades but many of the exterior shots were clearly photographed in the American west where I now live  Santa Cruz to be specific. Sort of like in the movie I watched last week that included all those mountains...in Florida. A minor point perhaps but nevertheless annoying as heck.On the other hand a number of segments were filmed in Williamsburg not long after it had been restored. Bravo for the film company! This is a powerful film and overall it does a pretty good job of telling its story within accurate history of the American Revolution.Grant does somewhat overplay his role...but I assume that to be the fault of the director Frank Lloyd. On the other hand Martha Scott is magnificent as the wife. It was not until this evening that I realized she also played the mother in BenHur a performance I have always admired. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is also excellent as the embittered proBritish father of Martha Scott. Other roles are also played well though none of the supporting actors stands out except for Richard Carlson who does a nice turn as Thomas Jefferson.I too prefer the suave sophisticated Cary Grant so this film will not make it to my DVD shelf. But I've watched it several times on TCM and probably will again. It's that good.".

This was probably influenced by the current world events of the time this was made when Americans were being sold on solidarity with our British cousins. The location shooting at Colonial Williamsburg is certainly a plus. However the movie drags on way too long for such a straightforward plot. Also Grant's role doesn't really play to his strengths. The rest of the cast is decent with Richard Carlson playing a likable Thomas Jefferson and Cedric Hardwicke being Cedric Hardwicke which is always great to watch. A young Peter Cushing has an uncredited bit role as well. It's not a bad movie just a little dull and overlong.

	schema:headline " Godard Clowns Around Creates Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Artists are often remembered more for their brasher earlier work  films novels paintings etc. that pushed the boundaries of their medium to create something bold and unique. Sometimes though we ignore the faults of those earlier works while more mature more perfect later works are ignored because they lack the visceral shock of the new inherent in the artist's first pieces.Godard strikes me as an artist of which this occurrence is particularly true. His Breathless ushered in the Nouvelle Vague of French cinema and has long been held as not only a classic but also his masterpiece. As wonderful and fun as Breathless is I find it much slighter Godard's later work most notably Vivre Sa Vie Le Mepris Bande A Part Weekend and of course Pierrot Le Fou.Breathless represents more technical innovation than anything else. It is a terrific story but one that lacks the thematic depth of those other films. Godard touches upon the ideologies that will concern him later but he does not delve into the plight of woman the pitiful nature of the bourgeoisie or the nature of film as much as he would in a couple years.For me the greatest achievement of Godard is Pierrot Le Fou. In it he combines comedy the road picture extreme pathos a scathing indictment of Capitalism and a critique of contemporary society in an unimaginable way. The film moves along following Ferdinand and Marianne but any semblance of a normal narrative gets lost along the way. This is of course welcome. You do not come to Godard expecting the ordinary.Though it lacks the photographic beauty of Le Mepris Pierrot nevertheless represents one of Godard's most brilliant uses of color. The use of color filters in an early scene reminiscent of Ivan the Terrible II's final scenes is quite arresting and the overall use of the eastmancolor pallet is gorgeous. This is a very very colorful film which is appropriate for such a playful narrative.The acting is similarly brilliant. Belmondo gives a more nuanced and more demanding performance here than he did in Breathless and Karina matches him. Like one of the great starlets of the 40s and 50s she bestows a grace beauty and elegance to her scenes. It helps that Godard's camera absolutely adores her not quite as much though as it adored Brigitte Bardot's rear in Le Mepris but much of what she does in this film derives from her talent rather than Godard's.Again though I must warn that Pierrot is not a film for everyone.Yes it's a funny brilliantly acted and beautiful film but it's also Godard one of the most acquired tastes in the history of cinema.That said if you've not seen this film and consider yourself a fan of this director see it soon  you'll not be disappointed.".

As wonderful and fun as Breathless is I find it much slighter Godard's later work most notably Vivre Sa Vie Le Mepris Bande A Part Weekend and of course Pierrot Le Fou.Breathless represents more technical innovation than anything else. It is a terrific story but one that lacks the thematic depth of those other films. Godard touches upon the ideologies that will concern him later but he does not delve into the plight of woman the pitiful nature of the bourgeoisie or the nature of film as much as he would in a couple years.For me the greatest achievement of Godard is Pierrot Le Fou. In it he combines comedy the road picture extreme pathos a scathing indictment of Capitalism and a critique of contemporary society in an unimaginable way. The film moves along following Ferdinand and Marianne but any semblance of a normal narrative gets lost along the way. This is of course welcome. You do not come to Godard expecting the ordinary.Though it lacks the photographic beauty of Le Mepris Pierrot nevertheless represents one of Godard's most brilliant uses of color. The use of color filters in an early scene reminiscent of Ivan the Terrible II's final scenes is quite arresting and the overall use of the eastmancolor pallet is gorgeous. This is a very very colorful film which is appropriate for such a playful narrative.The acting is similarly brilliant. Belmondo gives a more nuanced and more demanding performance here than he did in Breathless and Karina matches him. Like one of the great starlets of the 40s and 50s she bestows a grace beauty and elegance to her scenes. It helps that Godard's camera absolutely adores her not quite as much though as it adored Brigitte Bardot's rear in Le Mepris but much of what she does in this film derives from her talent rather than Godard's.Again though I must warn that Pierrot is not a film for everyone.Yes it's a funny brilliantly acted and beautiful film but it's also Godard one of the most acquired tastes in the history of cinema.That said if you've not seen this film and consider yourself a fan of this director see it soon  you'll not be disappointed.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've never been able to appreciate any of his films nor even understand them... I find his films affected intellectual selfobsessed and as cinema without interest and frankly dull... I've always thought that he made films for critics. That's Ingmar Bergman openly expressing his opinion about Jean Luc Godard's movies his 'contempt' to play on words.For a novice this statement might sound awkward from a director whose movies aren't exactly devoid of intellectual material except that Bergman and Godard don't play in the same league the oeuvre of Bergman is far more monumental and substantial. Bergman approached in cinematic terms and hypnotic cinematography the human condition with a constantly questioned involvement of God a brainstorm that spanned four decades of cinematic creation. What Godard offered is a questioning of cinematic and storytelling conventions which he's entitled to do after all except that by doing so he confines his movies into the very cinematic medium they're supposed to free themselves out. Godard strikes like the rebellious teenage son of cinema trying so hard to be different that it actually conditions him.That's Godard's paradox the man who denounced the traditional cinema is perhaps the most cinematic of all directors always indulging to a trick a false connection a disenchanted voiceover a sudden change of color and many outbursts of spontaneity within the script to prove that he exists that he wouldn't let any cinematic requirement affect his work that this movie we're watching is a movie and he's the director. Many shots are creatively done and Pierrot le Fou for all its craziness is a beautifully shot movie in fact Godard IS a talented filmmaker and some scenes are absolutely mesmerizing I especially love the little dance between JeanPaul Belmondo and Anna Karina it captures that idle casualness that nonchalant freespirited charm of youth in the 60's. But for one masterstroke like this you have countless moments where you're just wondering what the hell am I watching?.I know Godard is being deliberately awkward sometimes for the sake of a gag the film can be labeled as a comedy to some degree or because of the forbidding is forbidden philosophy. But just because you do something deliberately doesn't make it any immune to criticism it's only fair to determine to which extent the freedom of the director affects the appreciation of the story. And that's a parameter you wouldn't ignore unless you're wrapped up in a huge ego. To Godard's defense I don't know if he held himself in such high esteem or if the cohort of fans didn't simply build the colossal monument out of his Breathless making any movie he'd make a masterpiece. Well in 1965 I guess French youth was in demand of newness something that would echo their rebellious spirit something post modern and yes I concede that Pierrot le Fou is far more interesting than The Sound of Music but that doesn't say much.Indeed isn't it the height of irony that the postmodern masterpiece is now stuck to its era and became the true embodiment of the Nouvelle Vague? To be honest I've never been a fan of the New Wave in the first place I thought the movies that predated its beginning like Bob le Flambeur Elevator to the Gallows 400 Blows were more interesting than the revolution itself but when you look retrospectively the New Wave was only the occasion for selfabsorbed directors to prove how 'different' and modern they were. Time did justice to the French popular cinema of the 50's and 60's and people would rather watch The Sicilian Clan The Wages of Fear or any gangster flick with Gabin and Ventura than these pseudointellectual flashy movies. Pierrot le Fou exemplifies how hard creativity could damage credibility it's Godard at its most intrusive and it's a shame because the story had elements to grab the viewers.It's one of these romances on the lam with Ferdinand a man struck in typical bourgeois ennui takes the control of his life and escapes from his condition with Anna Karina Belmondo has fun playing Ferdinand aka Pierrot a role that allowed him to make a fool of himself but Godard want to steal the actors' thunder instead of letting the two of them run the show he uses them as puppets to the very statements he wants to make or nonstatement. I maintain that the New Wave's greatest achievement was to inspire the New Hollywood generation and when you look at Bonnie and Clyde Badlands or even Sugarland Express you can measure the differences between French and American cinema one school is entrapped in its obsession with originality another is busy telling the stories one rejects the classics another explores them and makes something fresh of it. Finally one feels like cinema one gets so experimental it's boring.And believe me I gave it a third chance I put it with the commentary on with Godard's numberone fan talking maybe he'd tell me things I couldn't see but he actually confirmed my suspicion in every shot it was Godard did Godard defied Godard changed. Godard is the real star of the film Pierrot le Fou proves that he's an iconoclast twisted and certainly talented director he just forgot that the essence of a movie is to plunge you in a world tell you a story and make you forget it's movie except if the selfreferential aspect is central to the plot. Not a chance with Godard he epitomized what's wrong with the New Wave selfawareness self obsession confining to intellectual masturbation selfselfism I want to say.The film isn't boring for all that and possesses a few moments of genuine tenderness and creativity but Godard once again is being his worst enemy and destroys the very edifice he's building for one scene that works you have five or six leaving you scratching your head or wondering if you won't going to watch Predator instead.".

Bizarre musical numbers and hilarious conversations with no relevance to the plot sometimes break up the story. Characters talk to the camera and Pierrot yells Mais je m'appele Ferdinand!

Try not to grin when Pierrot and Marianne reenact Vietnam for a group of American tourists.Pierrot is one of cinema's essential films perhaps because it came at the precise moment when Godard hit his alltime peak.

	schema:reviewBody "We often overlook the flaws of an artist's earlier work and then ignore their later more perfect and mature pieces because they lack the daring boldness and innovation evident in the first ones. This is especially true in Godard's case. Breathless was new fresh fun and stylish it was and still is considered a classic and his masterpiece. But as great as it is Breathless is mostly about technical innovation and lacks the thematic depth of its creator's later work. Godard only brushes along subjects such as class division and the nature of film which among many others he will devour in films to come in our case Pierrot le fou.I said 'perfect and mature' but those are qualities not typical of Godard. His films are always 'a work in progress' and he's not afraid of taking risks. That's why his work is usually considered ugly childish pretentious etc. But one should always be openminded and never expect the ordinary when going to a Godard film. To begin with it's impossible to confine Pierrot le fou to a particular genre as it doesn't adhere to a single form or convention but is instead a blend of comedy romance political thriller noir musical and so on. It is a road picture that is able to follow a straight narrative as much as a car is able to follow a straight road with Ferdinand behind the wheel. The director confesses that when he began working on his movie one week before I was completely panicked I didn't know what I should do. Based on the book we had already established all the locations we had hired the people... and I was wondering what we were going to do with it all.Godard has been criticized time and again for the purposeful disorientation of his audience. On top of a discontinuous plot he employs a wide array of 'sensorial techniques that serve to fragment the cinematic narrative.' Some of his trademark stylistic devices including loud colors obtrusive voice overs rapid jump shots out of sync sound etc. along with the abrupt interchanges between tones e.g. comic  serious constitute for a greater alienation of the viewer. The film opens with the voice of Ferdinand reading a passage Velzquez past the age of fifty no longer painted specific objects. He drifted around things like the air like twilight catching unawares in the shimmering shadows the nuances of color that he transformed into the invisible core of his silent symphony. Similarly Godard is on a quest for another kind of cinematic art one that isn't concerned with visual presentation of objects and characters as much as with what lies in between people space sound and color.With Pierrot le fou Godard wanted to break away from conventional cinema's chains go beyond any forms and formulas and attain something out of the ordinary clich. At one point in the movie Ferdinand is at a social gathering and meets an American director. When asked for the definition of cinema he responds A film is like a battleground. It's love hate action violence and death. In one word emotions. This explains precisely what Godard sought to achieve. He wanted to transfer emotions directly onto the viewer  not through actors and their characters but by means of style. Abandoning all conventional drama and substituting it with flickering prime colors godlike voice overs eerie music etc. in the ultimate search for an instant sublime surge of feelings was a chance Godard was willing to take. He considered this destruction of old rules and creation of new as something natural and necessary. As he himself asserts literary critics often praise works like Ulysses or Endgame because they exhaust a certain genre they close the doors on it. But in the cinema we are always praising works which open doors.Godard has created a film in the free form. A film deprived of structure. One that does not make any promises to the viewer but the assertion that love is beyond human control. Just like with love nothing makes linear sense and every moment is more important than the last. Pierrot le fou is not an easy film to take in. It places great demands on its audience. Some might find them overwhelming not worth the effort. But others those that manage to let go and keep going forward into Godard's chaotic but passionate exploration of reality might just enjoy the ride.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the end of Godard's Band of Outsiders 1964 it's promised that the next film will be the further adventures of Franz and Odile in South America in Cinemascope and color. Well maybe they didn't get as far as South America but Pierrot le Fou begins with Anna Karina dressed in her school girl outfit with matching braided buns from Band of Outsiders this film gets as far as the Riviera but it is in Cinemascope and color as Ferdinand and Marianne try to escape from the trappings of the bourgeoise world as exemplified by the cocktail party in which Ferdinand meets the American director Samuel Fuller who tells him What is Cinema?. For Godard Pierrot le Fou represented an important milestone in his career in it he would document the end of his relationship with Anna Karina. It is the most agonizingly romantic of his films there are constant reminders as the narration insists on the ultimate mystery the inability of one person to know another there is the moment when Anna Karina is seen in closeup as the narrator wonders when she says it's a nice day does she really mean it's a nice day? and the desolation of romantic desire.Yet the brilliant color the rapid rhythms even the songanddance numbers there are three color the unhappiness making this a vibrant tragicomedy.

	onyx:emotionText "At the end of Godard's Band of Outsiders 1964 it's promised that the next film will be the further adventures of Franz and Odile in South America in Cinemascope and color. Well maybe they didn't get as far as South America but Pierrot le Fou begins with Anna Karina dressed in her school girl outfit with matching braided buns from Band of Outsiders this film gets as far as the Riviera but it is in Cinemascope and color as Ferdinand and Marianne try to escape from the trappings of the bourgeoise world as exemplified by the cocktail party in which Ferdinand meets the American director Samuel Fuller who tells him What is Cinema?. For Godard Pierrot le Fou represented an important milestone in his career in it he would document the end of his relationship with Anna Karina. It is the most agonizingly romantic of his films there are constant reminders as the narration insists on the ultimate mystery the inability of one person to know another there is the moment when Anna Karina is seen in closeup as the narrator wonders when she says it's a nice day does she really mean it's a nice day? and the desolation of romantic desire.Yet the brilliant color the rapid rhythms even the songanddance numbers there are three color the unhappiness making this a vibrant tragicomedy. The film veers between exuberance and exhaustion yet for all its freewheeling formal invention this is one of Godard's most emotionally direct films a piercing lament on the perils of love.Godard would make two more films with Karina the short Anticipation and Made in USA both films far more formal and less emotionally engaged the end of the GodardKarina marriage the subtext of Pierrot le Fou would also inspire Jacques Rivette's L'Amour Fou.";

Indeed a parallel could be drawn with the ungrateful Iraqis who don't appreciate their liberation.Another criticism is the disorientating effect of the voice overs and out of sync sound effects.Pierrot himself refers to this at the party at the start of the film A machine to seemy eyes to speak my mouth to hear my ears but instead of having the impression of being a single person I feel like many. Which conveys modern man's fragmentation and dislocation while reminding us of the power of image and sound to disorientate for the purposes of political propaganda.As for no trace of beauty my god are you blind? As the entire film is one continuous flirt between the foxy Marianne and the camera. Why does Pierrot paint his face blue? .Well why does Travis Bickle shave himself a Mohican's hair do in Taxidriver? These may seem rather arbitrary at first but then again so are all the other thousand and one clichs in cinema such as the man offering the femme fatal a light for her cigarettewanna take in a movie? wanna grab a coffee?

	schema:reviewBody "Film is like a battleground tells Samuel Fuller Ferdinand in the beginning of this film Love hate action violence death. In one word emotion. 'Pierrot le fou' is a 110 minutes film by Godard and his tenth feature. It's roughly based on a crime novel written by Lionel White. Tho don't expect a linear adaptation. In fact Godard and his actors mostly improvised and therefore deliver a dodgy 'surrealeperiment'.The plot summary therefore must be given a little superficially It's about a wannabe writer Ferdinand Griffon Belmondo who escapes his every day life and runs off with his mistress Marianne Karina to the Mediterranean Sea. Far away from his family he lives for the moment reads books and tries to work on a diary. Meanwhile the police and Algerian killers are chasing Marianne because she has committed a murder.Godard assembles philosophical texts with shots of posters and screens sets in musical elements and achieves to encode his film in a very inspiring way. Sometimes the imagery is fair and beautiful i. e. Belmondo and Karina are running along a silhouette like forest which is photographed in front of a white flat background sometimes odious and angry i. e. Belmondo finds an Algerian murdered with scissors and he keeps on raking in the wound sometimes stirringly artistic i. e. Karina takes the murder instrument the scissors holds it in front of a wideanglelens and creates an unbelievably coherent effect of distortion.Those who take the film with a living mind will experience a fascinating beautifully filmed love story with two protagonists who do everything within the power of their tremendous acting potential. Concerning the contents it is a cinematic toying with the duality of the characters Ferdinand and Pierrot or Ferdinand or Marianne or rather with schizophrenia. Belmondo plays a mad crackpot who first has a pretty martialistic based life as a husband and father whose world view staggers because of upcoming converse feelings  personated by Karina. She married with Godard at that time plays the character Marianne with wit depth and anarchic charme. Her role is the symbolic enlightenment in Ferdinands being. While he strives melancholically for wisdom and always throbs on the importance of the arts Marianne is a lackadaisical playgirl and swinger who wants to be instead of having. Belmondo as Ferdinand shows in all of his agility a vulnerability that hides behind the same gruffness of 'Une femme est une femme'. 'Pierrot le fou' is a film that dines from various influences having some sort of private economic cultural or political natures. More than every other 'auteur' Godard manifests himself once more as the chronologist of his time.".

A married man returning home from a boring party meets there with a girl with whom he had a case five years before and is supposedly there to babysit his child or children. He had not seen her since then. They decide then to leave at once and start a car run through the country getting involved in a series of meaningless peripeteia like stealing cars and money filling the car tank and running without paying setting a car on fire entering with another in the sea on a beach and other minor events no less without an apparent reason and cooked through halfsentimental foolish dialogues during which he girl calls the man Pierrot though he keeps telling her that his name is Ferdinand without any reaction from her. We feel there is some story of arms traffic behind all this which is never clearly told or explained. At a certain point she is kidnapped by traffic rogues kills one of them with a pair of scissors and runs away. Then it's the man who gets caught by the traffic rogues that torture him in order to know where the girl is. Then he is free again did he escape or was set free by his captors after revealing where the girl is?. Then we see an old Lebanese countess proposing him to go with her on a boat but then the girl meets him again but suddenly escapes with another man that we don't know who he is and they kiss passionately each other. Our Pierrot Ferdinand chases them to the island where they went by boat and shoots and kills them both. The story? ends with Pierrot Ferdinand committing suicide in a way that would be funny if it wasn't tragic. He put 2 or 3 dynamite belts around his head but at a certain point he tried unsuccessfully to put off the fuse and we see the explosion in the horizon in the last scene. I have understood that Godard's movies don't have a sense a clear story or a message. They are worth for what they are worth and their scenes and images are worth for what we see and nothing more which means very little for me. However since he is considered a great movie director by critics probably this is my fault.".

Most of them are boring pretentious and without any structure indicating that they are filmed based in improvisations and not in solid screenplays.

That's because most of the reviews on IMDb are glowing and sound like a great movie. Unfortunately that's NOT the film I saw. I saw a piece of cinematic dreck masquerading as high art. And the movie was less fun than watching 500 hours of mimes performing! The film is an Absurdist messwith a completely convoluted plot. The characters speak in a sort of French version of Dr. Seussverse and do lots of stupid things that make no sense and I don't mean this in a GOOD way. For example as the stars are seen in her apartment the rooms were filled with a variety of guns as well as a dead bodywith no explanation or context. Later when she apparently expires the male star Belmondo paints his head blue and blows himself up with rather fakelooking dynamite.In many ways this movie is very similar to Prnom Carmen also by Godard. So if you liked this film then you'll probably like the other. Or in my case if you can't stand one you'll probably loathe the other.According to Leonard Maltin the rumor is that there was no script for the film. I can believe it!".

This seems to be the modus operandi he evolved throughout his career expression tweaked into a collage invented borrowed or burrowed with constant citations and the exploration of the language of cinema what can be expressed and will it break down in the process to reveal something. That breakdown is desirable here and I welcome the attempt and the breach. As such I'm starting to anticipate more the essayist Godard of later decades films like King Lear Notre Musique or the Histoires films than these New Wave films where irreverence is an aspiration. In Pierrot characters recite verse or poetry comics and paintings describe the action and no opportunity is wasted to point out the artifice of film. Godard is forcing open a pathway in an unknown direction but no goal or end in mind the path seems tedious perhaps only serving the transition to a destination that will be reached in the future.What I noticed immediately is that Godard again never misses a chance to react to the world. As JP Belmondo moves around from frame to frame in the opening party Godard points and laughs at the banality of bourgeois life. This reminds me of my perception of the hammertotheface Bunuel approach church is bad bourgeoisie is bad. A better film would begin to understand that people obsess with cars and fetishize them their Oldsmobiles or Alfa Romeos in the same manner that film fans obsess with film or at least attempt to explain the difference. I don't get that from Godard. Just around the corner from all this however Samuel Fuller explains the allure of cinema for us. Whereas in Breathless the author who quips profound banalities even as he oogles at Jean Seberg is anonymous here Godard choses a person of his affection. And later on JP Belmondo looks at the moon and tells Anna Karina an anecdote of quick stereotypes where the Russians swear by Lenin Americans by Coca Cola.So the narrative is cool in the face of it but is Pierrot thoughtful? What I get here is a film that reacts and expects the same from me a film that is sometimes an aesthetic object of desire I liked for example the driving scenes with the colored lights gleaming in the windshield of the car again the artifice of it but I don't get a film that perceives and is or makes me aware. I don't get the understanding only the passing cynicism and contempt. Does Godard reserve some of that cynicism for himself I can't tell. I know I liked the scene with the corpse in the apartment did present time turn into a flashback there to show us how the crime was committed or did Anna Karina kill twice? and I like how Godard switches chapters by cutups of the written word written by him or borrowed I wonder but it doesn't make a difference. It's in these moments that Pierrot is surreal in a pure form that even though the word is bandied about as a synonym of weird few have accomplished.In the end Pierrot the romantic fool defies death one moment and is a coward in the face of it the next. To get back to my first paragraph I can see that the only way for me to appreciate Godard's work is as the koan of the Zen Buddhists the short anecdote that means nothing in the face of it demands an answer and can only be answered when the mind is ready for it. The answer itself again means nothing it's the proof that the mind is unlocked the koan only the tool for it. Pierrot means nothing to me but is it part of an ongoing koan that can be understood as we apprentice to this cinema and does it unlock something? Knowing that Godard was a Maoist at some point in his life I'm inclined to not have any hope but he grew out of that and it's that later period of awakening or disillusionment? I'm setting my eyes on.".

Overall Pierrot le Fou is a lighthearted romp through the French Countryside starring two mainstays of Godard's work.  Belmondo and Karina are brilliant as a couple that love and need each other but are too cool to mean it.  They are on the run from arms dealers but the setting and their misadventures are as flighty as the occasional musical numbers and the villains pursuing them including a rather menacing midget.  Throw in some haphazard philosophical references and you have a film that intellectuals hippies couples etc. can all enjoy.".

A synopsis of this film and the others playing can be found at httpwww.goethe.deinsaulpprjff07flmfl1enindex.htm Who could resist the opening line in the festival booklet promo What would you do if everything you took for granted was taken away. That was enough for me to book and like all this years GFF films so far each journey and session has been a richly rewarding experience.Plus the bonus last night of having the films director and one of 5 collaborators of the screenplay Brigit Moeller at the screening and for a question and answer time afterwards This is an impressive film in content and construction. There is nothing low budget about it's look. I loved all the steely blues and greys. Berlin is an attractive city. I often wonder if American film producers have no pride in their country when so many movies from there are grainy and the locations props houses and costumes are so shabby.Here Berlin is smart Agata Burek is perfect as Valerie a late 20s very early 30's model in Berlin right on Christmas when suddenly her credit card stops working and the bank has cut off her credit.  SPOILERS AHEAD  She's booked into a 5 star hotel her car is in the basement car park. But she does not have any cash and no way of even getting the car out of the car park. Yes I was wondering if the film would spiral downwards as her situation worsened but that was not the case. Sure there were times when some of us might have done differently to her. Perhaps stayed on for Christmas lunch with the photographer and his girlfriend? Perhaps helped clean up her friends house after the party and earnt half the money? Even the car she drovea 1990s XJ40 Jag sedan that had perhaps seen better days was perfectly cast. Birgit the director did not put one foot wrong here.It was interesting last night in her after film talk to mention that she had stopped the film short one viewer asked a question on this. Would Valerie go back to Andre? As Birgit said she liked to leave it open ended. Perhaps romantically minded people would think so? She also touched briefly on how she read an article that prompted this movie. Something about a model reaching their use by date. I guess the same could equally apply to other professions where looks and youth are the currency.. working girls for example. Agata was perfect.. childlike in some situations as the 300 euro working girl what is the price. And while she never lost her pride it was fairly poignant when sitting at a caferestaurant at breakfast and the guy on the next door table gets and leaved. She quickly moves over and starts to pick over and wolf down his remaining food. Much like a dog would do. It was also interesting to hear above some of the other members of the cast. The actor who played the photographer is very well known in Germany apparently. As isDavid Striesow who played Andre. Quite big in arthouse films but not quite a TV star yet. Digressing his ex wife and child in the film were also gorgeous.Birgit mentioned that this film was made in Jan over 26 shooting days. I'm thinking either Jan 2006 or 2007. After the screening last night she is hopping on a plane back to Germany today for the German premiere Thu Apr 26 2007. She also mentioned that she came from a cinematographic background and had spent some time in jobs like a focus puller. She got people involved in the film with similar strengths to herself. It's beautifully shot and the location continuity and cast are first class.First film or 20th film this is a very impressive film. At 80 mins it felt longer than this. But for us it was quite a journey to the cinema and perhaps the free glass of sauvigon blanc pre the movie cut in. Our session was packed and the audience had quite a few laughs. The consensus was we all loved it.Another fine German film and one worth a trip of any sort or distance to see. Birgit might be in her 20's perhaps 30 at the most looking at her last night. She was an interesting and generous speaker warm and interested in feedback. If this is her first film we have a lot to look forward to with her future work.".

	schema:headline " Powerful statement on homeless life";
	schema:reviewBody "Valerie is a German Germanlanguage film from 2006 so this one had its 10th anniversary last year. The director is Birgit Mller and she is also one of many writers working on this one. Mller is a prolific cinematographer and this film here is her only work as the woman in charge behind the camera and of the script. or I should maybe say only full feature work. At 80 minutes only and this includes credits already it is a pretty short movie but that's not a problem at all as it is a nicely focused and essential little piece. I would not say that it is an actors' movie even if everybody in the cast including lead actress Agata Buzek and the two big names Striesow and nel does a fine job.The heart and soul is the plot thought and the story of a young woman struggling with her profession and she may turn into a homeless person as a consequence. This shows us pretty much that people without shelter can be found in every profession really and in every line of work. And for women it is especially depressing as they are frequently reduced to their physicality as a consequence and they may end up doing things they don't want to even if the alleged prostitution scene is handled by Mller very tastefully. This also shows that this is not a movie that wants to shock people and tries desperately to do so. Instead it feels like an authentic character study from start to finish and I never had the feeling I was watching actors. Of course I am not really knowledgeable enough to say if it is really accurate that she is not getting any modeling jobs especially with her looks but this is also not what the film is about. It is all the consequences that arise from it and also maybe about the big fractured ego of the protagonist. I enjoyed the watch overall. This is certainly a film that is underseen and one of the better German movies maybe even best from 2006 for sure. See it if you can.".

	onyx:emotionText "Valerie is a German Germanlanguage film from 2006 so this one had its 10th anniversary last year. The director is Birgit Mller and she is also one of many writers working on this one. Mller is a prolific cinematographer and this film here is her only work as the woman in charge behind the camera and of the script. or I should maybe say only full feature work. At 80 minutes only and this includes credits already it is a pretty short movie but that's not a problem at all as it is a nicely focused and essential little piece. I would not say that it is an actors' movie even if everybody in the cast including lead actress Agata Buzek and the two big names Striesow and nel does a fine job.The heart and soul is the plot thought and the story of a young woman struggling with her profession and she may turn into a homeless person as a consequence. This shows us pretty much that people without shelter can be found in every profession really and in every line of work. And for women it is especially depressing as they are frequently reduced to their physicality as a consequence and they may end up doing things they don't want to even if the alleged prostitution scene is handled by Mller very tastefully. This also shows that this is not a movie that wants to shock people and tries desperately to do so. Instead it feels like an authentic character study from start to finish and I never had the feeling I was watching actors. Of course I am not really knowledgeable enough to say if it is really accurate that she is not getting any modeling jobs especially with her looks but this is also not what the film is about.

	schema:reviewBody "There are very few works of 20thcentury American literature that can be called indispensable to our understanding of our culture. And one of these few is Jack Kerouac's On the Road. As everyone knows it's the thinlyveiled autobiographical account of Kerouac and his friends in their pointless but exuberant adventures across America. For 50 years it's been waiting to be made into a movie. Now at last.So everyone already knows the story well no chances are if you're like me you read the book and yet remember almost nothing of the story. The book burns through its shreds of storyline as if they were just tinder for the blaze of its energy the real fuel is the pacing even with all its redundancy. It's the momentum that sucks us into the breathless chaos of Kerouac's world. We come away impressed by the energy not the content.Film could certainly have been used to amplify this effect but this is not that film. Instead we have a more conventional treatment focusing on character development. It's a nice production with an attractive cast. But the story comes at us very differently from the book experience. The manuscript has been rewritten to add breathing space and objectivity. We see Sal Paradise only halfformed at the start of the story pull himself together to become a serious writer. We see the endlessly exuberant Dean Moriarity ultimately coming to grips with the progressive self destruction attributable to his amorality and suffering. This might be a fair reading of Kerouac's ultimate feelings about that part of his life but it's not the feeling that Kerouac shares with us in the book. We have lost our innocence our last chance to revisit it even for a few hours is taken away.I'm not going to rage against this reconception of the story though because it makes other changes from the book that might be improvements. Several episodes that were censored from the book are restored in the film. Some discussion of this at httpwww.univie.ac.atAnglistikeasyriderdataBeatEros.htm. So the movie is more historically accurate and far more sexually explicit than the book. That could also explain its delayed US release. In one poignant scene Carlos Marx Allen Ginsberg is whining to Sal about how vulnerable he feels due to his poorlyreturned love for Dean. To the best of my recollection that conversation was not in the book please tell me if you believe otherwise but was expressed in a private letter from Ginsberg to Kerouac many years after the fact. This kind of thing changes the emotional flow of the story certainly but it adds depth too.Few of us will actually suffer nostalgia for the gritty overindulgences of the Beats. But remember this came at a time when society was absolutely saturated with the message that everyone should be normal safe predictable. Without the tiny minority of Beats attacking that message and specifically without On The Road to chronicle that attack the cultural revolution of the 1960's would have been even more difficult than it was and perhaps less effective. Good bad or ugly we must embrace this story.".

	schema:reviewBody "The On The Road novel has inspired numerous readers myself included to take an American road trip. Will the film have the same effect? I sincerely doubt it. And herein lays the problem. Whilst the book takes the reader on an exuberant spirited journey full of life the film puzzlingly slows the pace right down and presents a muted almost depressed version of the same story.This is best illustrated by the presentation of the character of Dean Moriarty. He should be the driving force of the story pushing the storyline on with his crazed excitement for the good and bad in life. On the printed page he can barely speak fast enough to get all his thoughts out. However in the film he huffs and puffs his way from one scene to the next speaking in a laconic drawl whilst lacking all the charm and charisma that is supposed to make him so alluring. He is the muse for the writer character of Sal but anyone coming to the film fresh without having read the book may well struggle to understand why.The film lacks a rounded sense of the hedonistic side of the journey. The sex is arguably overplayed and whilst there is some drugs and jazz there is little of the booze. Crucially the characters rarely seem to be having a good time. The film seems to focus on the melodramatic miserable aspects of the characters lives at the destinations they travel to but fails to contrast this with wild and exciting times spent on the road. The film does not convey a sense of travelling for the journeys sake they always just seem to be in the car in order to get to another destination. The only time the film gets anywhere near the free spirited adventure of the book is when the characters reach Mexico in the later stages of the film but this is too little too late.I did wonder whether the muted atmosphere of the film was a deliberate ploy of the filmmakers however the last ten minutes would indicate not. Here we see the character of Sal typing up the notes he has made during the road trips seemingly franticly typing to capture all the wild fun crazy times had on the road. However this does not reflect what the viewer has just witnessed on screen for the past two hours.Taken on its own terms the film does offer fine cinematography costume and the look of the time as well as some decent acting hence my score of 5 out of 10. However as an adaption of a seminal piece of literature it deserves to be judged against the source material and in not capturing the true spirit of the book it is a big fail.".

There's a good reason why we had to wait so long for a screen version of On the Road. Impossible as it may be to believe some novels are not written with potential movie rights in mind. On the Road is a sometimes rambling stream of consciousness string of vignettes without a clear goal in mind. It is a novel about hedonisticdeathdriving on America's highways in a quest for life and a run from it. For the members of Kerouac's Sal Paradise's group life is controlled selfdestruction because death is preferable to boredom. These attitudes spring from the times in which the reality of potential nuclear disaster hung over the nation and the attitudes so induced found expression in youth who turned the directionlessness of life into life for the moment.Making a film on such a book requires selection. Kerouac's hedonistic rampage across America as selected by director Walter Salles looks more mindless and sexspiced than it did in the novel. Kerouac as we see in his later works was a hedonist with a conscience a deadly combination which likely led to him drinking himself to death. Director Salles sees what he wants to see a sexcrazed drugcrazed twodimensional man. If this was truly the man represented in the novel the novel would not have had the enduring quality that has made it literature.I liked the way the 1950s was captured in the film. It was as close to perfection as you could get. The importance of jazz with its improvisation mirrors the lives of the travelers. The acting is good but the interaction is not. Maybe that was the point. There is no need for interaction in an age when the highest morality was based on selfishness. The movie may be okay to watch once but I would prefer not to go down this road again.".

	schema:reviewBody "The nutshell people is this the screenwriter director and producer all fail to grasp the existential nature of Kerouac's writing which was and still is its whole point.To get the novel you need to blur your focus slightly think about the more esoteric and the context of the time of when it was written. Kerouac put forth his own personal spiritual reality and also that of the spiritual connection between himself and other characters without implying how he or the reader should be thinking or feeling which leaves the reader resonating with philosophical questions. Does anything mean anything? Does loving someone who doesn't return that love mean anything? What is love? Are we just pawns in a greater spiritual reality? Should we care? If so why?The book and these questions were part of a spark that started a shift towards youthful selfconsciousness greater questioning of western life and human realities that has endured to the present day. This aspect of Kerouac's work is the quintessential element his admirers praise and respect him for and this movie fails completely to illustrate this most important part. In fact it seems as though it was not even attempted or omitted on purpose. The movie also fails to illustrate the broader context of the time it was written as well the concept of piercing through the two dimensional American cultural reality of the time and breaking through into a freer space rebelling against the rules society has laid down for you and in turn sparking thoughts in people's minds of how the future could be one where minds were more open standards were questioned and prejudices overcome. This same shift in thinking and questioning contemporaneous norms added fuel to the fires of the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti War Movement. Kerouac was someone who helped spark a wave that reached its peak in the late 60s over a decade after the publishing of On The Road but disappointingly you will get none of this from the movie. Instead this movie stands for everything the book doesn't a dressed up soulless vacuum of a period piece that doesn't really go anywhere with any discernible purpose. It alienates the viewer within the first half dozen scenes instead of drawing them in with that friendly 'best buddyyouneverhad' Kerouac familiarity. Many people new to the Beats and to Kerouac will leave this movie feeling that they just don't get what all the fuss was about and that's because this movie goes nowhere near doing justice to either of these institutions. For Kerouac 'true believers' of which I am obviously one who respect the importance of his work this movie will be an affront as it is brought to the screen by people who were not capable of representing him or the work on screen.For road trip fans this movie will hit most of the right buttons and therefore there will be some positive reviews as you see here. My feeling is that regardless of previous achievements and my overwhelming respect for producer and director the makers of this film should be ashamed of themselves in bringing this movie to the screen without capturing the soul of the book and the man who wrote it. You can only assume that they didn't get that aspect or chose to leave it out because it was too hard to realise. However I simply cannot believe Coppola viewed this film in its entirety prior to release and Salles seems to have overestimated his ability to turn this seminal universal masterpiece into a movie. It simply just isn't worthy.".

This same shift in thinking and questioning contemporaneous norms added fuel to the fires of the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti War Movement. Kerouac was someone who helped spark a wave that reached its peak in the late 60s over a decade after the publishing of On The Road but disappointingly you will get none of this from the movie. Instead this movie stands for everything the book doesn't a dressed up soulless vacuum of a period piece that doesn't really go anywhere with any discernible purpose. It alienates the viewer within the first half dozen scenes instead of drawing them in with that friendly 'best buddyyouneverhad' Kerouac familiarity. Many people new to the Beats and to Kerouac will leave this movie feeling that they just don't get what all the fuss was about and that's because this movie goes nowhere near doing justice to either of these institutions. For Kerouac 'true believers' of which I am obviously one who respect the importance of his work this movie will be an affront as it is brought to the screen by people who were not capable of representing him or the work on screen.For road trip fans this movie will hit most of the right buttons and therefore there will be some positive reviews as you see here. My feeling is that regardless of previous achievements and my overwhelming respect for producer and director the makers of this film should be ashamed of themselves in bringing this movie to the screen without capturing the soul of the book and the man who wrote it. You can only assume that they didn't get that aspect or chose to leave it out because it was too hard to realise. However I simply cannot believe Coppola viewed this film in its entirety prior to release and Salles seems to have overestimated his ability to turn this seminal universal masterpiece into a movie. It simply just isn't worthy.";

It's a lovely setting for this movie small and intimate I don't think big cinematic rooms with a 100 muttering teens won't do this movie any justice. Before I start off I haven't read the book so I won't judge on how well it's transfered to a script. To me maybe because I haven't read the book the movie was quite difficult to follow as it felt that a true story line was missing. it was just a bunch of lost youngsters trying to find the essence of living a life. The whole movie felt like somebody was telling a story about how to make and loose friends in a split decision and how to ruin your life royally. I absolutely loved Tom Sturridge. He plays this gay poet with so much depth and essence. You can see he really tries to feel what Carlo has felt.I also think it was one of Kristen Stewart's best performances. the way her story flows through the movie is refreshing. You see Marylou grow and develop the realization that even with all the living life filled with sex and drugs isn't full filling her needs and that she needs more. It's well played and Stewart just embodies the sexuality that is needed in this movie.I loved Hedlund's performance... he was clear in his emotions. though I really didn't like the character Hedlund made me feel sorry for him in the end. I have to admit I was a bit disappointed by Riley's performance. I felt it lacked emotional dept at moments were I thought it had to be more. especially the moments he spend behind the typing machine or with his family. Overall it was not my type of movie but a good choice if you want something different than the straight forward happy ending blockbusters...".

So I was curious about the movie would Walter Salles be able to turn this legendary but rather monotonous novel into a good film? The answer unfortunately is no. In short the films shows a bunch of young people enjoying booze dope girls jazz speeding and shoplifting. They go from one city to another but it doesn't really matter wherever they are they do the same things. After the first hour you start to hope for some story development but there is none. This is especially annoying because the movie goes on for more than two hours. In the end it's just a repetition of the same themes in different settings. The film follows the book rather scrupulously and I think this is a wrong choice. The book needs more adaptation to make it suitable for the big screen. More than anything else it needs a plot. Of course there are also positive things about the movie. It's a nice period film about the forties. The acting is fine with good performances by Twilightfamed Kristen Stewart and especially Garrett Hedlund a lesser known actor who could be quite a revelation. This film will certainly not become as legendary in cinematography as the book has become in literature. But then again that's almost impossible.".

Anyone that has read On the Road has to question the wisdom of attempting to translate that into a decent movie.Like the novel there are parts of this film you just have to fight through in the hopes that he'll move off his love for grape picking  into something interesting again.The plus side is once you make it past the stagnation the plot picks up again  you feel the sense of freedom having overcome the monotony of Kerouac. But on the otherhand I'm fairly certain that's the point.The bottom line is that if you are familiar with Travelin' Jack you know what to expect before you walk into the film  you walk out with an experience far better than you would have thought it's be. It's an enjoyable film.However if you're like most of the world  for some reason do not read you'll be expecting the legend without understanding the reality  you will hate it for no other reason than the lack of background necessary to expect Kerouac to be well Kerouac.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had high hopes for this film which were quickly quashed four scenes later when not a thing had happened.I think that it was a real shame as the art direction was great the camera work was interesting and pleasing and the acting was really great. A particularly great performance from Garrett Hedlund as Dean. I don't think any of the actors can be blamed for the poor film that it was. What is to blame in my opinion was the script direction and editing. It did not have a plot or direction and seemed to make no point. It was a series of scenes showing off how 'cool' these writers were and how pretentious the filmmakers could be without making any real point.The thing that I disliked most about this movie was that nothing but the costumes and sets reflecting the 1950s. The characters spoke as if they were in the 2000's were open about sex homosexuality drugs and race. They seemed to face no repression or hardship whatsoever they were living in the great depression yet all they did was drink party do drugs sleep with women and write. I found it very difficult how the characters talked constantly about how bad their lives were how they wanted to die and were living in a society that was horrible. I saw none of this!!! Their lives seemed wonderful partying with friends writing and traveling around America with the ease of popping into any passing car and meeting an array of interesting and friendly people. What was amazing about the true story of these writers was that they were emerging from a society of repression they were the first intellectual writers emerging from an uneducated society due to the depression. They were opening up to the 50s as a modern generation the first beat poets. However the writers within this movie faced no repression the only hardship was money  but even money issues seemed to be solved finding work a couple of days later. And the main character could even return to his mother if things got too bad. The people they met were filthy with clothes that looked old enough to be falling off them  yet they lived in houses with huge expanses of rooms candles and fantastic ornaments in even greater locations. I found myself saying why not just have a shower and wash your clothes in one of your 5 bathrooms?Although the reason for my issues with this film is its unrealisticness the reason that I hated the film was because it had no plot. Now I am fine with movies that have no plot but they need to say something about ANYTHING. This movie was about a group of young writers who were trying to gather enough experiences to write a novel but at the end of the film I found myself thinking  why was I involved in that? What did they want to say? Was there any point to what I just watched? It went for two and a half hours one hour easily could have been left on the cutting room floor. Don't even get me started on the useless character of a third chubby male who travelled with them and seemed to serve no point and a elongated series of scenes at a house of two heroin addicts who had no real relevance to the story. It was self indulgent pretentious and had no idea what its own reason for existence was. You just need to look at poster after watching the film to see that the filmmakers don't know what point they are trying to make. What a useless load of sht.".

	onyx:emotionText "I had high hopes for this film which were quickly quashed four scenes later when not a thing had happened.I think that it was a real shame as the art direction was great the camera work was interesting and pleasing and the acting was really great. A particularly great performance from Garrett Hedlund as Dean. I don't think any of the actors can be blamed for the poor film that it was. What is to blame in my opinion was the script direction and editing. It did not have a plot or direction and seemed to make no point. It was a series of scenes showing off how 'cool' these writers were and how pretentious the filmmakers could be without making any real point.The thing that I disliked most about this movie was that nothing but the costumes and sets reflecting the 1950s. The characters spoke as if they were in the 2000's were open about sex homosexuality drugs and race. They seemed to face no repression or hardship whatsoever they were living in the great depression yet all they did was drink party do drugs sleep with women and write.

	schema:reviewBody "On The Road is only the skeleton this film is fleshed out around. It is not simply the novel made into a movie. Director Walter Salles WAY expanded it. For starters he used the scroll not the '57 edition as the working blueprint. And a ton of the movie came from Neal Jack  Allen's letters Carolyn's book the LuAnne interview Jack's audio recordings  in other words there's a lot of stuff that's not in the novel. But it's all based on accounts not solely Jack's account as told in that one book scroll or not.It's not the novel On The Road as a linear film. It's an interpretation based strongly ON that novel but it ain't a literal filming of the storyline. It's a work of art its own work of art a new work of art based on an old work of art.There's lots of cool things about it. I don't want to spoil it for you but many of the specific scenes in the novel that always stood out for me are in the film. And since it's so nonlinear you don't know what's coming next. And it's Oh wow! It's this scene! No way! It's so funnycool that way. Something that Jack might spend a few paragraphs on in a 300page novel could be 3 minutes of the 137 minute movie. And things he might cover over 20 pages aren't included at all. It's kind of a series of choice scenes portrayed.And the cameos by Terrence Howard and Steve Buscemi are to die for! That two of my favorite actors are in this in such weird and wonderful ways is just great.And Viggo as Bill! Holy heck! Maybe the best part of the film.And the music is GREAT. Yer gonna love it if ya love it.There's loads of problems big and small but I'm not gonna mention 'em cuz maybe you won't even notice 'em. It's its own work of art its own statement its own piece. It's new and different and will stand or fall on its own. But the movie of On The Road now exists. And here it is  2 hours and 17 minutes. It's more large than small. It's more new than old. It's more timeless than dated.How this is gonna play for other people will be interesting to see. There's gonna be the Beat world's reaction and then the nonBeat world's. Beat people in general are gonna like it  cuz it's On The Road and so much more. People who have only read the one book and have it emblazoned in their brains may have trouble with how it's been expanded or edited by the limitations of the medium. I have no idea how nonBeatfamiliar people will respond. Not a clue. I think if you were predisposed this way you'd already be there.Oh and there's a whole lotta sex in it. The things that are said and the things that are shown for The Puritanical American Rating System this is gonna be an R fer sure. I mean there's handjobs oral gay straight threeways you name it  and fbombs which actually were not in the casual vernacular of the time the way they're used in this film and certainly not in the novel. This is definitely an adult movie. Which if you know your On The Road was a very Grated book other than the subject  the sex is all offpage and the language is clean. The movie  not so much.I look forward to experiencing this many more times under many different circumstances in many different mindframes with many different people and how it'll continue to reveal new colors and angles with each new Road adventure. It's a memorable expansive dramatization. It's a helluva party condensed into 2 hours. It's a road trip with old friends to familiar places. But you better leave the book at home and be ready for anything.".

All right the film is not completely rubbish the cinematography and the acting is good and sometimes even brilliant. That said the movie is still a waste of two and a half long hours and yes indeed those two and a half hours feels like three long days. Despite the decent performances by the actors none of the characters are ever allowed to evolve. We never get a sense of how they are as persons or what they have at stake. There's nothing that makes the viewer care about the characters except maybe for Dean Moriaty in the end. Here we get a glimpse of why he's so messed up but it in the last five minutes of the movie. All the other characters are portrayed very superficial especially the women who are all portrayed as extreme stereotypes of distressed women all the characters do is discuss on a quasi intellectual level then have wild and crazy sex which after you've seen it for the 117. time seems dull and then they go their separate ways for no apparent reason. Then a new character is introduced then another and then yet another. Most characters are on screen for less than five minutes which of course means that you as viewer don't get to care about them at all. For instance Viggo Mortensens character. Viggo Mortensen is on the poster for the movie for crying out loud but he is in the movie in three short scenes and nobody knows why the hell is in the movie. But oh gone he is and on to the next chapter with a similar character doing similar things. After an hour I felt I was dying inside. After two and a half hours in the company of this repetitious movie I felt like I had been in Guantanamo prison for a year.".

And in spite of Walter Salles' proved talent the experience turned out to be a dreadful journey. Everything is so boring that although each character has a strong image and existence following each one is a painful ordeal. The movie is extremely slow and yawninspirational. The interesting cast is a mixture of new and old faces that when joined together don't seem to leave an impressive mark. I may sound a tad pessimistic but the truth is that I couldn't wait to get out of the screening room. Incredibly boring and not so amazing as the book.

I was delighted in the film adaptation of Naked Lunch i hoped ON THE ROAD would be a good adaption to the great book. There are pro's and cons of this film. Kudos for finally making this film. Albeit the movie Heartbeats was a well done version of a biographical telling of the characters. I suspect this film wanted to divert from that take on the story. It was a great task and it worked on many levels. If i had not read the book i would be rating the film an 8 in all likeliness. What the film did well it got the tender side of Dean. I don't feel like Kerouac could of done that as well but then again the film left out some of the creepyness of Dean's character. A good job with the locations camera work and capturing the road trips. Not a bad job on several of the characters. What the film missed or differed from the book not a clear reference for sal and his relationship with his mother they did a bad job depicting bill lee and they seemed to miss that dean was aging greatly in sal's mind at least by the last time sal saw him.

	schema:headline " While the cinematography and acting are good the overall spirit of On The Road is missing.";
	schema:reviewBody "I consider On the Road to be one of the greatest books ever written so I guess it's not surprising when I say that overall the film let me down. There were some parts during which I felt it did the text justice. The very end scene with Sal and Dean standing together for the last time. The underlining sadness of Sal and Dean's and Marylou's arrival to San Francisco. Tom Sturridge's portrayal of Carlo Marx especially his relationship with Dean and of course Gerett Hedlund's madness as he played Dean Moriarty which was possibly the best part of the entire production. However there were also a lot of moments where I felt the director did not get it quite right. I was disappointed with how little there was of Sal's story on the road before he travelled with Dean and Marylou. I understood they were probably going to leave out most of the beginning of his journey but I really wanted to see the scenes with Terry longer and more developed. When I read to book there was something about that time he spent with her that was both tragic and beautiful at the same time yet none of that made it into the film. Old Bull Lee's character felt grossly undeveloped. The man had this incredible presence in the book and it just felt to me as if the director did not consider him important at all. This is not to say that Viggo Mortensen did not play him well he did. My issue here is more with the script writing and direction. However the one thing that I missed the most from the film was the underlining presence of the whole book the feeling of searching for something. It felt as if the film was twodimensional rarely bringing out those feelings. There were some instances when it did for example the last scenes in and following Mexico Marylou's arrival in Frisco and Carlo's feelings about Dean but overall the feeling was generally missing.I consider On the Road to be a good film but it wasn't the amazing production expected. I know a lot of people interpret the book in different ways so my views on it may differ from other's and other's views on the film. This is simply my opinion.".

I own it on laser disc and just had to buy a widescreen TV with home theatre sound to do it justice. I can watch this movie as often as I crave substantial food which is very often. Robert Wise besides being the director of The Day the Earth Stood Still West Side Story and The Sound of Music started his career as the editor of Citizen Kane and it is his input in the editing vibrant energetic kinetic masculine that makes this movie a real winner and actually brings life to the giant vistas of this classic and tragic fairy talewar movielove story. Max Steiner's beautiful score adds several other dimensions to this masterpiece and its interplay with the editing is always fascinating to watch. The general impression is a beautiful dream of the paintings on a Greek urn coming to magical inspiring colourful life. It is also fascinating to watch how the fight scenes were a sort of preliminary study to the ones in West Side Story which is basically on the same subject. I had better stop while I'm ahead. One word of advice Don't believe the naysayers i.e. Leonard Maltin until you have experienced it for yourself in all its CinemaScope Warnercolor and Stereophonic glory.

HELEN OF TROY as directed by craftsman Robert Wise is very pleasingly made and with excellent action and spectacle  especially in the well populated fiery siege scenes. No CGI in those days there really was a couple of thousand dressed and armed extras running all over the huge set. Apparently Robert Wise is on record as having said he took the 6 million assignment because he hadn't yet directed a spectacular....! Told from a different perspective than the 2004 version this 50s view is from the point of Paris as opposed to Archilles in the new one. It would be like the new one being told from Orlando Bloom's perspective rather than from Brad Pitt's. HELEN OF TROY on DVD has good extras including the TV specials made with Gig Young as a promo of the time. The huge set created in Italy was recycled into SODOM AND GOMORRAH given the orange pillars and layout. HELEN OF TROY has excellent Warnercolour and beautiful art direction. It is a good film and well worth seeing after you see TROY as a companionchaser.".

I wondered how I would feel about Jacques' performance after seeing Orlando Bloom play a rather wimpy Paris in Troy. Sadly there didn't seem to be any chemistry between Paris and Helen in the new version. When comparing the original classic version I was pleased to find that it still remains an exciting and dynamic story and could not be improved with extravagant special effects. Helen of Troy has a romantic poignant warmth and the audience is compelled to hope that Helen and Paris can have a happy life together. In the new version it didn't seem to matter if they stayed together or not their story almost felt secondary to the glorious story of Brad Pitts' Achilles. Needless to say I highly recommend the remastered DVD of Helen of Troy 1956 for the discerning movie viewer.".

The Greeks are unsuccessful in their intents until they listen to the cunning Ulysses Torin Thatcher that decide s to withdraw the one thousand Greek ships from the Trojan waters and offer a wooden Horse of Troy as a gift to the winners. The underrated Helen of Troy is an engaging romantic adventure with a wonderful version of Homer's epic poem The Iliad. The beauty of the Lybian Rossana Podest compared to Aphrodite gives credibility to the passionate love of Paris. The grandiosity of scenarios and cast that includes a brunette Brigitte Bardot and the magnificent direction of Robert Wise make this feature a mustsee. I do not understand the unfair bad reviews of this great epic. Just as a curiosity the episode Revenge of the Gods of The Time Tunnel uses uncredited footages of this feature. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Helena de Tria Helen of Troy".

	schema:reviewBody "Paramount and Cecil B. DeMille kickstarted the 194966 wave of ancient world epics with the biblical tale Samson and Delilah while MGM and Fox made their mark with gospel spinoff stories Quo Vadis and The Robe respectively. Warner Brothers were a bit slower to jump on the bandwagon and when they did the fables they chose were refreshingly pagan. In 1954 they produced the delightfully silly Land of the Pharaohs and followed it up with this one of the bestknown and most enduring myths of ancient Greece.Pictures like this have a reputation for being somewhat corny and insincere. And Helen of Troy is a shameless part of that tradition. It is admittedly a neat and fastmoving retelling of the legend but its dialogue ranges from laughable to banal. Characters make wooden statements that were obviously someone's idea of ancient wisdom. Slaves talk back to their masters without so much as a telling off. What is particularly inept is the way the writers obviously felt they had to get in famous lines like The face that launched a thousand ships and Beware of Greeks bearing gifts so we have to listen to them bending the dialogue towards these clichs to the point where they sound utterly trite  Hmm that's a lot of ships out there at least a few hundred no I'd say a thousand. And what launched them eh? Other than poor writing another thing that tended to make these epics lacking in intimacy was poor use of the new Cinemascope aspect ratio. This was a big problem in The Robe which was the earliest release in that format but Helen of Troy's director Robert Wise handles the wider image with care. While he takes full advantage of the extra space for crowds and spectacles for the more intimate scenes he brings the performers closer to the camera and mutes the backgrounds so as not to overwhelm the moment. He also makes great use of tiny bits of light or movement especially the recurring fire motif to draw our attention to certain bits of the screen defying the tendency for individuals to get lost in a big screen. One of the best examples of Wise's control here is the first scene at the Spartan palace where Paris and Ajax have their knuckleduster dual. It's pretty clear that Jack Sernas and Maxwell Reed fight like well like a couple of bad actors but Wise instead focuses us on the fervour of the crowd to give us a more savage impression of the brawl. He then moves in to closeups of Niall MacGinnis and Rossana Podesta against plainer backgrounds but still with a little movement in the frame to match their emotions.But all this sensitive direction cannot save us from some appalling acting performances. I can see why Sernas and Podesta were cast in the lead roles. They are both young and beautiful and their unfamiliar faces give them a freshness and innocence. But they can't act and the dubbing doesn't help. It's not all bad though. Niall MacGinnis gives a tremendous performance. He boils the character of Menelaus down to nothing more than a jealous husband and his intense manner dominates the screen. Stanley Baker is also really good radiating thoughtless aggression with his every move. As for the rest noone really stands out or satisfies even such worthy names as Cedric Hardwicke and Nora Swinburne.The Warner Brothers epics of the 50s were really little more than Bpicture with Abudgets. Like the equivalent productions at rival studios they featured gargantuan sets hordes of extras and breathtaking spectacles but they also suffered from weak scripts and dull casts. Still some of Robert Wise's best efforts up to this point were actual Bpictures that he had treated with credibility and managed to eke some depth and sentiment out of. It is his intelligent handling of the elements in the frame plus the handful of classy performances that raise this one just a little above a mediocrity.As a kind of postscript to this comment here are a few miscellaneous points of interest. Max Steiner's score has his usual habit of commenting hysterically on every line or movement but there are some nice little musical touches to the scene of the Greeks marching on Troy that are worth listening for. Later on have a look at those siege towers. Isn't it convenient that the trapdoors fit exactly between the battlements of the Trojan walls? They must have got someone to go round with a tape measure before they built them. And finally listen out for an early use of the Wilhelm scream sound effect decades before it became hip and ironic.".

The film focuses on the love between the Trojan prince Paris and the Spartan queen Helen. That's not inconsistent with the mythological version. But the film portrays Paris as a hero whereas Homer portrayed him as a womanizing coward disliked by his own countrymen and mocked by the enemy Greeks. In spite of this the film is well worth watching. The battle scenes are well staged particularly the climactic duel between Achilles and Hector. The fall of Troy is also a highlight. The actors playing Helen and Paris are adequate. Stanley Baker as Achilles and Nial MacGinnis as Menelaus steal the show.".

Well I wouldn't stake my life on it you know! It's a genre I personally love so I wondered why I hadn't heard about it long before now? After viewing it it became evident why it's just not any good.

Robert Wise lived up to his surname by meticulous attention to detail. Most of the cast were British so Lithuanian actor Jacques Sernas Italian Rossana Podesta and French Brigitte Bardot's voices were carefully dubbed to avoid annoying and inexplicable variance in pronunciation which could have been a major flaw as in other films such as The Vikings and Spartacus.This was a believablerealistic treatment with authentic period sets actually modeled after the palace at Knossos. Although the god's presences were not visually intruded their influence was definitely felt through the convictions of the characters. In the opening scene when Prince Paris Sernas is blessed before taking ship on an embassy to Greece he blithely alludes to his preference for the love goddess Aphrodite and thereby insults war goddess Athena whose emblem is the horse. The ominous sequence of events is thus subtly launched.When Paris is shipwrecked we believe that it is the doing of Poseidon. And when Queen Helen of Sparta vacationing incognito at the seashore discovers him cast up on the beach we can understand his mistaking her for the goddess Aphrodite rising from the waves and then for Aphrodite's special gift to him. If she is the most beautiful mortal woman to Helen he is the most godlike of mortal men. The unhappy loveless queen is equally smitten. Their fates and the fate of their nations are sealed.The film lavishly unfolds the inevitable war and the resulting destruction of Troy. There isn't a single dead moment in the film something of interest is always happening the action carried forward by an exceptionable music score. The guilt and sadness of the lovers the suffering Trojans the brawling Greeks are all strikingly portrayed. Even the braggart Achilles is sympathetic when he mourns for his lover Patroclus.The events leading up to the sacking of the city have never been better filmed. Contrast this convincing Greekstyled seemingly handhewn wooden horse carrying a shield with the emblem of Athena to the origami version in The Trojan Horse the rag and barrel doglike travesty in Troy or the unbelievable extravagantly elaborate castmetal object in the TV miniseries and you can see this for yourself.When Helen is forcibly taken back by the Greeks her only solace is in knowing that her love for Paris will never die and indeed it hasn't their legend is immortal.".

HELEN OF TROY focuses on character work over action although there are a handful of stunning scenes of massive armies on the march and one or two decent battles to boot.Sadly the script is sub par for the most part lacking the fun of say a later Italian peplum picture. The cast is also undistinguished. Rossana Podesta is your typical Hollywood idea of beauty with a face full of make up and little acting talent and the other romantic leads are less than impressive.

	schema:reviewBody "As most people probably know from reading the Iliad by Homer Helen Rossana Podesta was the most beautiful woman in the world and happened to be married to King Menelaus Niall MacGinnis of Sparta. Paris Jacques Sernas was a Trojan prince who got shipwrecked near Sparta and upon seeing Helen fell in love and then managed to take her back to Troy with him. Some accounts say that Helen was kidnapped by Paris but others say she left of her own choosing. In any case this abduction resulted in all of the Greek citystates joining forces to besiege the city of Troy in order to return Helen back to Sparta. Now as I stated earlier since most people are probably familiar with the story of the Trojan War I probably don't need to elaborate any further. That said although this movie isn't completely true to the Iliad it is an interesting interpretation of the Trojan War and since there are other Greek sources with slightly different variations I suppose this version is as acceptable as anything else. Be that as it may I thought the casting of both Helen and Paris were good choices and each of them played their parts quite well. I also liked the cinematography which was excellent for its time. Accordingly I believe that viewers who appreciate epic adventures of this type will thoroughly enjoy this particular movie and I rate it as above average.".

	schema:reviewBody "In comparing this version of Helen Of Troy with the more recent Troy it's quite the tossup. Both didn't quite live up to expectations the casting in a few places doesn't quite work. There was also different emphasis placed on the classical figures in each film. This version also uses a cast of thousands and in the current version computer graphics are used to show the mass armies of both sides.I never understood why 20th Century Fox never thought to film this with Tyrone Power the role of Paris seems like such a good fit for him. Jacques Sernas was adequate but not more than that. Rosanna Podesta is one magnificent looking Helen in a role that asks nothing more than being the first celebrity romance in history. I'd be hard pressed to choose between Peter O'Toole in Troy and Cedric Hardwicke. Each so well portrays the world weary and war weary Priam so well. Hecuba is reduced to a cipher in the current version. But Nora Swinburne is not just a magnificent queen but a caring mother for her rambunctious brood of Trojan princes and one princess.My favorite as he's likely to be in any film he's in is Stanley Baker. There is quite a difference between him and Brad Pitt. Brad was a reluctant warrior as in Homer's epic. But Achilles as Baker realizes him is just a warrior who likes battle with the zest of a warrior who knows the gods have given him near invincibility. Baker brings so much passion to anything he does he usually blows me away with any performance.Next to the stories of the Bible Homer's epics are probably the most universally known tales and everyone is a critic. For me this Helen Of Troy is a good if not great retelling of the tale.".

The face that launched a thousand ships? Beware of Greeks bearing gifts? Computer viruses referred to as Trojans or Trojan horses? Achilles heel? The Stanford football team? Condoms? But I don't know. A poll in 2010 before Independence Day found that one in five Americans didn't know which country we had achieved independence FROM. I'd always thought that was part of our shared vernacular culture too.Anyway the handsome young Paris from Troy goes on a peace mission to Greece where he foolishly falls in love with Helen  it was her face that launched all those ships  and he steals her from her husband King Menelaus and runs off with her to Troy. This irritates Menelaus. He organizes an expedition and besieges the city of Troy in what is now Turkey. Lots of bloodshed follows. The war lasts something like ten years. Finally the Greeks pretend to retreat and leave a giant wooden horse outside the gates of Troy. The Trojans think it's a parting gift and drag it inside the walls. But it's hollow. The sneaky Greeks come out after the Trojans have gotten drunk and gone to bed and the gates are opened. Goodbye Trojans.This is a godless movie. References are made to Athena ugly and pugnacious and to Aphrodite pretty goddess of love fawned over by Paris. But we don't see the influence of the gods directly. You don't find out how Achilles got to be so nearly invulnerable. It comes close to being one of those cheap sword and sandal epics that were so popular in the 1950s but it rises above them because of its budget and the willingness of the writers to stick a LITTLE more closely to Homer's original. The hundreds of extras are real people  real actors rather than pixels acting as actors. And the international cast must have cost a lot.I guess Paris is made too much of a hero at least in my opinion. Even in The Iliad he struck me as a moron for running off with a power rival's wife even if she was as good looking as Rosanna Podesta. Menelaus was even more of a moron for starting a bloody war over the affair. And the other Greek leaders were even more dumb for following him. And it's not as if the Greeks solved all their domestic problems immediately after the victory either.The movie paints the Trojans as honorable and peace loving  except for that one minor episode of kidnapping and adultery. The Greeks are angry disputatious and warmongering. The armor the Greeks wear is uglier than that of the Trojans. Achilles the greatest of the Greek warriors is sulky and dresses in drag to avoid being drafted into the war. This was 1956 the middle of the Cold War and I wonder if all those binary oppositions  The Free World versus The Iron Curtain  influenced the writers' construction of the combatants.At any rate I always liked the Trojans better anyway. The only Greek I admired was Ulysses. When the ships set sail from Greece after the kidnapping the director Robert Wise gives us shots in quick sequence of three of the major plays and their expressions tell us all we need to know about their character and motives. Menelaus scowls grimly determined to get his wife back. Achilles wears a smirk anticipating lots of slaughter crowned with victory. And Ulysses wears a selfcontained smile dreaming of plunder.It ought to be added that the musical score is by Max Steiner. As far as I know it's his only attempt at a fully blown orchestral epic score and he handles it pretty well. There's the triumph theme that is required for all historical epics. There's the martial theme when we see those hundreds of armored extras marching towards the forbidding walls of Troy. And there's a love them that dominates them all as I think the story of Paris and Helen dominate the movie.".

Studios produced a sensational epic film version of Homer's classic. It was bound to happen as swordandsandalBibletimes epic films were suddenly taking over American theaters in lush Technicolor or the even newer and more attractive Cinemascope. These big expensive production films were released in hopes to entice audiences to the movies again because there was a new medium that kept people at home  television. Robert Wise director of 1965's The Sound of Music his most famous and memorable film collaborated with screenwriter Hugh Gray to labor on an ultimately gorgeous epic film about the tragic fall of the city of Troy. Although it's long and often grandiloquent in its dialog at least in every scene before the climatic finale the film has its ups and downs. First off the acting represents a standard melodramatic 50's technique. The blonde doeeyed Rossana Podesta Helen is classically beautiful in her physical aspects but it's evident she is costumed and madeup to look like a living statue of Aphrodite thus being less of the real Helen and more of the old image of the famous face that launched a thousand ships. While Homer makes it clear that the principal hero is Achilles at least when compared to the other heroes who include Ulysses Aeneas Ajax Hector and Paris  the hero of this version is Paris played by an Apollolike Jacques Sernas. His chemistry with Rossana Podesta is not as strong as it should be and he himself lacks the towering strength and heroism that Homer uses to bring his male characters to life. But like I said this film is loaded with the type of standard 50's melodrama which is of interest to fans of classic film. In this film you can catch other celebrated actors hamming it up in crowns and togas  Sir Cedric Hardwicke portrays King Priam Nial MacGinnis plays the imperious and possessive Menelaus Janette Scott plays the blind mad prophetess Cassandra whose predictions of the fall of Troy are ultimately fulfilled and Brigitte Bardot who would later rise as a sexy and charismatic actress in the 60's and 70's plays Helen's slave girl Andraste. As for the bad parts well..the film is grandiose and the actor's speeches and conversations read like some great Greek play written by Aeschylus himselfinstead of being a bit more realistic and human as opposed to mythic. In contrast the 2004 Troy starring Brad Pitt Eric Bana and Orland Bloom is at least more credible though in truth both films stray from the original Homeric sources. The color and cinematography is indeed exquisite and the vast set replica of the ancient city of Troy is downright realistic. Add the beautiful vistas of ocean full of war ships cliffs and fortresses and you get a very dramatic and beloved classic image of the old legend. And if this film is excessive and takes itself seriously despite characters saying things like the world has never seen a greater war the gods have decreed it etc this type of film had an audience in fact the same that would see The Ten Commmandments with Charleton Heston and Yul Brynner the following year and BenHur in 1959. This was a time in the 50's when people could afford to lose themselves in a vast recreation of another time and world. This one is a winner.".

And despite a lifelong hatred of girly films and all things romantic comedy this slice of 80s college cheese surprisingly hit the spot.The story is nothing new boy an effervescent Cusack as Walt Gibson meets girl Daphne Zuniga and an antagonistic relationship is formed. He hates her studious organised approach to life she frowns upon his laddish devilmaycare attitude. Inevitably they are soon thrown together  namely by Gib's trip to California on the promise of a blond beautiful sure thing from best friend Lance Anthony Edwards coinciding with her journey to visit her boyfriend  and opposites begin to attract.Yet to complain that the plot is predictable would be to miss the point. You know the ending within the first five minutes it is the journey there which is important. Director Rob Reiner handles the script with a necessarily light touch and allows the humour to be more characterdriven than situational. To the writers' credit even the film's most obvious scenes are always relieved through it's witty and eminently quotable dialogue.What elevates 'The Sure Thing' above the ranks of its genre contemporaries is Reiner's deft hand with a character in particular his ability to transcend stereotypes yet create instantly recognisable believable people a feat he later put to effective use in 'Stand By Me'. This is underpinned by Cusack's energetic performance showcasing what has become his staple character the spikily droll male whose shining qualities just avoid being undermined by his easily discernible flaws.'The Sure Thing' is also notable for its treatment of  and fondness for  the minor characters few of whom suffer from the obvious spare part phenomenon of so many high school based films. Particularly commendable are Tim Robbins' disappointingly brief turn as one half of the cutesy couple from hell and a remarkably younglooking Anthony Edwards in the longterm buddy role notable especially for what must be one of the worst 80s fashion statements since Vanilla Ice decided on baggy trousers  see the pool scene featuring Lance's phone call from California.Despite its premise this film always endeavours to be about love rather than sex. A refreshing angle on a wellworn tale 'The Sure Thing' provides a welcome escape from the 'American Pie' view of teenage romance. With consistently endearing performances from both Cusack and Zuniga this is one romantic comedy I would happily give a second viewing.".

When you consider the relatively young age of the actors Daphne Zuniga was 22 and John Cusack was only 17 and it was only Rob Reiner's second film it makes this film that much more of a milestone. Maybe the storyline is predictable so what. The acting by Cusack and Zuniga is perfect. They make this movie seem real and honest.What makes this movie so enjoyable and memorable is the feelings it provokes. Remember the rush of emotions when you first meet someone who makes your heart beat out of your chest and feel lightheaded? Acting like you really don't like someone when deep down inside you would give anything to be with them? Going to a party and flirting with other people hoping that they would see you and get jealous? That's what this movie does for me. It makes me realize just how much I miss the innocence passion and emotion of those days. The acting is wonderful and you really get drawn in to their plight as they make their way across the country to be with the one they think is their own sure thing. The great thing about this movie is that every time it looks like they are finally going to get together something pulls them apart. While there are many funny lines and memorable scenes in this film by far my favorite is at the end when Gib's essay is read aloud. Allison's facial expressions let you know just how painful it is for her to hear it. The final scene is wonderful. I tearup whenever I see it and I'm a guy.".

What carries it is that it's the classic John Cusack Movie where Cusack is just being... John Cusack. Totally real totally unpretentious. You can see it in everything else he's done even things of totally different style like Eight Men Out and The Grifters. He just rules the screen and the production ends up recalling pictures like His Girl Friday and It Happened One Night. This has stood up to nearly fifteen years of viewing pretty well. Compare and contrast other stuff of that era like St. Elmo's Fire and Fast Times At Ridgemont High. Or any Tom Hanks movie of the period.I've now come back five years after originally posting this review it's now May 2007 and I say this film STILL stands as a classic Cusack even after I have in the interim loved Pushing Tin Being John Malkovich and of course the amazing High Fidelity.

And although Gib  Cusack  is promised a guaranteed lay if he makes his way down to California the movie is not at all about getting laid and bare breasts and sex it is about falling in love and the lengths we'll go to obtain the affection of the opposite sex.The story starts off with Gib in his first year of some Ivy League school while his best friend from highschool Lance Anthony Edwards is partying it up in sunny California.  Gib is already striking out with the babes on his college campus and to make matters worse Lance is seemingly getting action everyday.  Then Gib walks into his English class and notices Allison played by Daphne Zuniga.  She is not your typical bimbo in the movies.  She is smart pretty articulate and she flat out refuses his advances towards her.  She does agree to see him strictly on a study basis and he ends up making himself look even more silly and barbaric.  Eventually Gib and Allison end up in the same car pool to California.  She is going to see her boyfriend and he is going to bang the Sure Thing.  Later a trucker remarks to Gib  3000 miles just to get laid hey you pay the speeding tickets and I'll get you there.  Of course along the way Allison and Gib find they have a mutual admiration for each other and it is only up to the viewer to guess the outcome.  Shouldn't be too difficult.So far this may sound like pretty lame stuff and perhaps it could have been except for a few things.  One is the writing two is the acting and three has to be Rob Reiner.  First of all Allison and Gib are given plenty to do and they have much funny dialogue to go with it.  Allison is goated into showing how she is not as repressed as Gib thinks she is by flashing her assets to a passing car.  Gib teaches Allison how to shotgun a beer using any household utensil I use a pen.  Gib rescues Allison from a wouldbe rapist in one of the funniest moments in the film  I think I'll take your wife .  There are also some great performances by some of the supporting characters.  Tim Robbins and Cusack must have met on the set of this movie and thus their strong friendship over the years can be accredited to the filming of this gem.  Here Robbins plays Gary Cooper but the not the Gary Cooper that's dead and he is one of the most annoying drivers that you could be stuck with for a cross country trip.  Viveca Linfors plays the English professor and she has a way of making you want to learn how to write properly learn Shakespeare and express yourself.  As she says in the film  Life is the ultimate experience but you have to experience it in order to write about it.  And of course Anthony Edwards is quite funny as Lance.The Sure Thing is not raunchy the way Porky's or American Pie is.  It is not crude the Fasttimes or Last Road Trip is.  But it is honest in it's humour and fair with it's balance of love and lust.  This is 15 years old but it is one of the best teencomedies to come out of the 80's.  90's comedies and ones that are made in the new millenium are quite good but there is an innocence that cannot be imitated from films like this.  I think a film like Here On Earth may have had The Sure Thing  or maybe an episode of Bold and Beautiful  in mind when they made that film.  It tried to be sweet and funny but failed miserably.  The Sure Thing not only doesn't fail it surpasses your expectations.10 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought this would be an 80's version of American Pie but it's actually a very sweet almost innocent movie. You got a typical hormone driven college freshman guy who drastically decides to travel cross country and meet a girl he's only seen in a picture. Then you have a pretty albeit dull and driven girl who lives and dies with her planner. Basically the plot is simple and predictable. Somehow they hate each other's guts and end up going on the same road trip where they endure a lot of hardships that bring them together. What I enjoyed about the movie was that there was actually very little sex involved which was very refreshing. The chemistry between John Cusack's Gib and Daphne Zuniga's Allison characters was very strong but not nauseous. I found myself almost cheering when Gib and Allison started sharing feelings and groaning when Gib still wanted to sleep with that sure thing girl. Although I'm kind of a hopeless romantic I still want to see a decent film and I thought this one definitely was. The acting was terrific the atmosphere set by Rob Reiner kept my attention and I would definitely see it again. Fav scene after Gib dreams about Allison in the shower he has his arm around her the next morning. It was definitely an Awww moment.".

	onyx:emotionText "I thought this would be an 80's version of American Pie but it's actually a very sweet almost innocent movie. You got a typical hormone driven college freshman guy who drastically decides to travel cross country and meet a girl he's only seen in a picture. Then you have a pretty albeit dull and driven girl who lives and dies with her planner. Basically the plot is simple and predictable. Somehow they hate each other's guts and end up going on the same road trip where they endure a lot of hardships that bring them together. What I enjoyed about the movie was that there was actually very little sex involved which was very refreshing. The chemistry between John Cusack's Gib and Daphne Zuniga's Allison characters was very strong but not nauseous. I found myself almost cheering when Gib and Allison started sharing feelings and groaning when Gib still wanted to sleep with that sure thing girl. Although I'm kind of a hopeless romantic I still want to see a decent film and I thought this one definitely was. The acting was terrific the atmosphere set by Rob Reiner kept my attention and I would definitely see it again. Fav scene after Gib dreams about Allison in the shower he has his arm around her the next morning. It was definitely an Awww moment.";

One of the most underrated films of the 1980s this film not only marked the second directorial effort by Rob Reiner THE PRINCESS BRIDE WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... but also the starring debut of John Cusack one of my alltime favorite actors even if he wasn't I'd still feel the same way about this film.  Even after 15 years this film remains fresh funny and wonderfully romantic with a tenderness and innocence that's missing in so many teen films.  It still offends me how so many teen films put it out today with CAN'T HARDLY WAIT leading the pack could become hits with their target audiences and films like this are left on the video shelf being forgotten.  Their excuse may be simply that it's old but considering how cliched teen films are today I can't believe they are smart enough to realize that.   It's a shame that THE SURE THING hasn't recieved the DVD treatment so that it could be rediscovered by today's audiences. THE SURE THING stars Cusack as Walter Gib Gibson a guy who loves junk food beer and life in general but feels lost for the first time in his life in terms of love when he completes high school.  While having a beer with his best friend Lance Anthony Edwards he recalls all the women he's been with and how's he's changed.  We now find out that they are about to depart to seperate colleges  Lance is going to California and Gib is going to an Ivy League school up in the Northeast.  Gib discovers that college is not all it's cracked up to be and soon starts to flunk English. This is when we meet Alison Bradbury Daphne Zuniga a straightA education committed young woman who is too uptight to say the least.Gib tries but fails to win Allison and finds himself back to Square One when he gets a call from Lance.   Since Christmas is coming soon Lance invites Gib to travel cross country to spend the holidays with him. Gib declines until Lance mentions that there is a very special person...who loves sex who would very much like to meet him.  After seeing a picture of this sure thing that Lance sends him he immediately makes plans to travel to California.  He soon realizes that he's not travelling alone but with Alison who's also journeying to CA to see her boyfriend calling him uptight would be much too kind. The majority of the films shows them on the road trying to get to California though they soon learn not only tolerate but also respect each other and soon their goals become dimmer but not forgotten.  There are so many wonderful moments on this little trip!  Instead of using cliches director Reiner likes to poke fun at them like in a nearrape scene where Gib becomes a real actor or when Alison is learning to shotgun beer one of Gib's favorite hobbies and finally discovering the last thing you'd expect to be sticking out a car window while driving by. Finally when they both arrive in California Alison learns of Gib's reason for coming and the climactic scene is at a dorm party where unions are forged words are passed and feelings are finally looked at by the two main characters.  The film's final sequence is quite unusual and different which is all the more reason for you to forget the film's only negative element. That element that THE SURE THING seems to get attacked by is predictablity though most people shouldn't care considering how charming and funny the film is.  Sure you know that Gib and Alison are going to end up together but the trip to that point is something to a grab a seat for. Writers Steven Bloom and Jonathan Roberts make every character real and believable and manage to give nearly every one of them an unforgettable line.  Saying just one of those lines would spoil a lot for the person who hasn't watched this movie yet.  All I'm saying is if there is a film that shouldn't be missed it is this one because like a lot of critics said It's a genuinely special love story.".

	schema:headline " The Sure Thing...is a sure thing!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Sure Thing is one of Rob Reiner's lesser known films from the 80s. It was his second feature after making his debut a year earlier with the superb This Is Spinal Tap. And although TST is just as good as anything else Reiner was producing during this period its never gone on to cult status like his other films of the 80s. Certainly not when compared to Spinal Tap or The Princess Bride.And The Sure Thing proves that Spinal Tap was no fluke on Reiner's part. It was not beginner's luck. This is a wonderful movie. Very confident. Very funny. And in John Cusack's own words an absolute laughriot.Walter Gib Gibson Cusack is a college freshman unlucky in love. He's a young man who says much and means little. He has his eye on Alison Bradbury Daphne Zuniga a studious prim and proper girl in his English class but he's just not her type. On the rebound Gib is invited to come down to California for Christmas by a friend where he can get laid with no consequences no guilt and no strings attached. Its a Sure Thing!The only problem is that getting to UCLA is harder than he thought. Not only does he have to put up with bad weather money troubles and sleazoid truck drivers he's sharing his journey with Alison. On her way to LA to meet up with her milquetoast boyfriend Jason these opposites find themselves attracting each other. Their nightmarish road trip has brought them together but Jason and The Sure Thing are still waiting at the end of the line.The Sure Thing is the film Planes Trains  Automobiles might have been if John Hughes had made it as one of his teen movies. And although Hughes was the undisputed king of the teens during the 80s Rob Reiner shows quite a flair for it as well. I think its sad that The Breakfast Club and Fast Times at Ridgemont High are considered quintessential teen classics while The Sure Thing is cruelly ignored.Reiner has clearly put a lot of thought into these two characters. Gib and Alison are not just sculpted from the textbook study of teen stereotypes. Much as he did with Spinal Tap Reiner takes steps to make them real people. Gib and Alison start out as walking clichs and end up as human beings.The Sure Thing could seem very predictable. Right from the second Gib and Alison end up on the road together we have a pretty good idea where this film is headed. But Reiner proves that excellent direction expert casting and witty writing can overcome even the most familiar scenario. The film emerges as a considerable delight.One thing I especially enjoyed about TST is the way it knowingly plays into our expectations only to sidestep them wittily at the last minute. Reiner's direction is pretty deft during Gib's dream sequences. At one point we're led to believe he's scored with the girl of his dreams. But that's all it is...just a dream! Especially when The Sure Thing turns into Alison. There are lots of neat little gems like this throughout the movie. They make the film a real treat.And as always Reiner's handpicked an exceptional cast. In his first starring role John Cusack rises to the occasion admirably as the glib Gib. Its a performance of sly ironies something that Cusack would build out into a whole career. He plays Gib as someone who's just looking to get laid when the real Sure Thing Alison is standing right in front of him. And he knows it but he's trapped within teen insecurity to know what to do about it. John Cusack has always seemed an intelligent performer and TST along with High Fidelity and Being John Malkovich are the three finest films on his resume.Daphne Zuniga probably gets her best role here as the uptight Alison. She's not really an actress that I pay much attention to but she does quite well here. Watching her prissily share the screen with the sexmad Cusack is always fun especially with Gib melting down Alison's icy exterior. There is genuine chemistry between them. They're discovery of each other is ably conveyed even when they become confused by the emotions that come out in the process. And Alison's a girl of marvellous contradictions spontaneity has its time and place.My favourite character of the film and one we don't see nearly enough of is Gib and Alison's freespirited English teacher Professor Taub. Played by the late Viveca Lindfors she is absolutely delightful! Her English classes are so interesting. And she's such a charismatic and persuasive figure. She's a character that really deserves her own movie. You could easily imagine her in a female equivalent of Dead Poets Society. And the way she provides the bridge between Gib and Alison at the end is a charming touch.There are lots of good actors throughout the movie. Look out for a young Tim Robbins as Gary Cooper but not the one that's dead the carpooler from Hell. Nicollette Sheridan as the aforementioned Sure Thing. Even Jason is allowed to develop some depth. Going from a bookish stiff to a freaked out young man when he learns Alison is in love with Gib.Despite falling within the trappings of the road trip genre The Sure Thing much like Planes Trains  Automobiles transcends its origins and becomes a sweet and appealing story. I knew Gib and Alison would wind up together. That was never in any doubt. But its the way Rob Reiner gets them together that makes this such a great movie. An underrated addictive film that's aged flawlessly and shows Reiner's chameleon ability to swap genres with total ease.".

	schema:reviewBody "What happened to the once so great director Rob Reiner? In the beginning of his directorial career he won critical praise with movies like This is Spinal Tap Stand by me The Princess Bride When Harry met Sally Misery and The American President. And then... the magic disappeared. What the hell happened? A movie that absolutely belongs in his great movies list is The Sure Thing 1985 Reiner's directorial debut. After watching this movie for probably the 20th time or so I just had to write a comment for the IMDb. This is an absolute classic!I guess nobody else but Rob Reiner could have turned this story  about a boy who's willing to travel 3000 miles in order to get laid  into a great hilarious and classy roadmovie. All the performances are great. John Cusack... well what's not to like about his character Gib? He's funny charming and crazy in a positive way. Other now great stars make their appearance Tim Robbins Anthony Edwards and even the gorgeous Nicolette Sheridan of Desperate Housewives fame in the title role. As the sure thing she is as sexy as hell! Even old timer Viveca Lindfors as the literature teacher is brilliantly cast! But the one who really steals the show is Daphne Zuniga. She starts out as this stiff allworkandnoplay girl and changes into a woman who enjoys life and likes to take small risks.The Sure Thing is one of those hidden treasures of the eighties. Well written and greatly acted. Rob Reiner at his best!910".

After watching this movie for probably the 20th time or so I just had to write a comment for the IMDb. This is an absolute classic!I guess nobody else but Rob Reiner could have turned this story  about a boy who's willing to travel 3000 miles in order to get laid  into a great hilarious and classy roadmovie. All the performances are great. John Cusack... well what's not to like about his character Gib? He's funny charming and crazy in a positive way. Other now great stars make their appearance Tim Robbins Anthony Edwards and even the gorgeous Nicolette Sheridan of Desperate Housewives fame in the title role. As the sure thing she is as sexy as hell! Even old timer Viveca Lindfors as the literature teacher is brilliantly cast! But the one who really steals the show is Daphne Zuniga. She starts out as this stiff allworkandnoplay girl and changes into a woman who enjoys life and likes to take small risks.The Sure Thing is one of those hidden treasures of the eighties. Well written and greatly acted. Rob Reiner at his best!910";

	schema:headline " After A Weak Start This Turns Surprisingly Enjoyable";
	schema:reviewBody "For the first half hour or so this movie comes across as little more than a typically sophomoric and lame comedy about a guy who's looking for action with a girl  and it wasn't even outrageous enough to be truly funny. Gib John Cusack has just graduated from high school and gone on to an unnamed Ivy League school. He's frustrated by his lack of success with girls and by his inability to get the attention of his classmate Alison Daphne Zuniga. Then out of the blue he gets invited by an old high school buddy to come to California for Christmas where his buddy will set him up with a sure thing. To that point there was nothing particularly special about this movie nothing noteworthy nothing even especially humorous. But then the road trip begins and somehow it all begins to fit together.True  you see the end coming almost from the beginning. Gib and Alison have to end up together. That's the whole point of a movie like this. The question is going to be how they end up together. And that actually became a very enjoyable and at times funny story. It turns out that Alison is also going to California for the holidays to visit her boyfriend and against their wills they end up having to travel together and through a series of misadventures they fall for each other. In fact I think one of the truly sweetest scenes I've ever come across in a movie is the scene in which Alison and Gib wake up with him holding her in his arms after they innocently shared a bed on the trip. She knows that this is innocent that nothing happened and simply enjoys the feeling of being held he wakes up and immediately starts to assure her that nothing happened that he hadn't tried anything. In a way that was the central scene of the movie as their feelings for each other are defined at that moment. In addition to an enjoyable story I thought this was also notable for a look at some fairly well known performers early in their career. Here I think especially of Anthony Edwards and Nicolette Sheridan. In all honesty both were unrecognizable as respectively Gib's high school buddy Lance and the sure thing Lance has set Gib up with in California. Edwards was quite good in the role while Sheridan didn't have a lot to do except look hot  and she pulled that off quite well!Overall this is predictable it's formulaic it's altogether unoriginal  and in spite of all that this movie really does grow on you in the same way that Gib and Alison grow on each other. The development of their feelings for each other really is fun to watch and you really do feel a sense of satisfaction as their kiss at the end of the movie signifies that they've arrived at the destination fate intended for them.This is a fun movie to spend some time with. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sure Thing is great 80s teen comedy. John Cusak in his finest of sarcasm stars as Gib a fellow who's not having such a hot time as a freshman at an East Coast school. His halcyonic buddy Lance Anthony Edwards invites to his friend's beach house for the Christmas break. And Gib with some coaxing decides to take his friend up on his offer with promises of a 'Sure Thing' awaiting him basically a former Catholic School girl played by Nicolette Sheridan.Though the only way Gib is getting to California is by hitching with some students one of which is an obnoxious hypercritical and excessively structured classmate Alison Daphne Zuniga who doesn't like Gib too well after a failed study session turned an attempt to have some fun and break a few harmless rules. Alison and Gib are total opposites and together they're going to have to put up with each other if they're going to get to California where Alison is visiting her equally nerdy boyfriend at his college campus. Being a hilarious story filled with misadventures of the two stranded students trying to make it in one piece to their respective Californian destinations it is also a romantic comedy. Gib and Alison may start out as uncomfortable opposites with the carefree Gib beer and porkrinds for breakfast kind of guy and the strict Alison her life is a day planner but after awhile they grow on each other. For Gib he realizes this anticipated 'Sure Thing' isn't what he really wants. And for Alison who starts to adapt to Gib's carefree fun lifestyle maybe she doesn't want to hang around with her snobbish boyfriend either. Suddenly their expectations had to change in order to accomodate reality. Only it's not that easy since both are as usual to proud to tell each other how they really feel. If you're a sucker for romantic comedies you can't go wrong. Cusak and Zunigan were great together.If you love 80s teen comedies and especially if you love John Cusak particularly in his younger roles then you'll probably enjoy 'The Sure Thing.' It's a sweet funny movie. I particularly love the hitchiking scene where Gib pretends to be a wandering madman.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bearing in mind all the obvious issues with this film it is a great surprise to me that it is one of my favourites. Firstly it is a romantic comedy. I don't do romantic comedy. I am one of those males who the thought of softening to a romcom reduces to a preteen err I wouldn't kiss a girl state. I enjoyed 'Last of the Mohicans' but that was an adventure with a romantic element. This is definitely a romcom dead square and centre. Secondly the whole film is so dated to an era which was not the greatest of my life. Within five minutes of the start with the music clothes and 'Miami Vice' font I would expect anyone born before 1975 to be able to date this film to within 1 year either side. Thirdly despite the journey not enough is made of location to describe this as a road movie. Lastly the plot is entirely predictable within the romcom formula. As soon as the male and female leads fall out you know what is going to happen by the end of the film... whoops is that a spoiler!?!. Despite these problems 'The Sure Thing' hits the mark. This era produced some now badly dated and still immensely enjoyable American films like 'Ferris Bueller' 'Weird Science' 'The Breakfast Club' and 'Flight of the Navigator'. Like those films the script acting and direction are firstrate you can laugh at and laugh with the Cusack character and understand why he gets up the nose of the Zuniga character. There are many genuinely funny moments and an underlying humour through it all. The minor parts  the party animal the geek the irritating couple  are all stereotypes but sympathetically drawn. Campus life is fun but innocent fun. Yes there is drinking and fooling round but no drunkenness fighting drugs or pregnancy. This is the ultimate appeal of the film and it is a nostalgic one. It is innocent and simple like you wish your teenage years had been. The way the central characters draw together and meet halfway not one adapting to the other sustains the film throughout. For all its obviousness this is an enjoyable film to watch.".

It's a kind of mixture of the oldfashioned romantic comedies from the '30s  '40s and the newer sex comedies that were all the rage in the '80s. The script is excellent and there are some great performances. John Cusack is extremely likable and charming in this. Daphne Zuniga is pretty good too. But it's Cusack who really carries the movie. There's also some nice supporting work from Anthony Edwards and Viveca Lindfors. Tim Robbins is fun in an early role. Nicollette Sheridan plays the sure thing of the title. She's required to do little more than look pretty which she accomplishes with ease. The first half is better than the second but it's all good. The plot may sound like it's going to be a childish Porky'stype movie but it's nothing of the sort. Definitely worth your time.".

It's a kind of mixture of the oldfashioned romantic comedies from the '30s  '40s and the newer sex comedies that were all the rage in the '80s. The script is excellent and there are some great performances. John Cusack is extremely likable and charming in this. Daphne Zuniga is pretty good too. But it's Cusack who really carries the movie. There's also some nice supporting work from Anthony Edwards and Viveca Lindfors. Tim Robbins is fun in an early role. Nicollette Sheridan plays the sure thing of the title. She's required to do little more than look pretty which she accomplishes with ease. The first half is better than the second but it's all good. The plot may sound like it's going to be a childish Porky'stype movie but it's nothing of the sort. Definitely worth your time.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Sure Thing is an 80's classic teen film that holds up very well into present day as the relevant themes still hold true no matter the decade you're in. Led by an assured performance from John Cusack this is a very sentimental film that is in the lines of what you would expect from John Hughes. It's a sweet sentimental growingofage story and a betterthanaverage road trip film to boot. Rob Reiner's film is about a boy named Water Gibson who decides to go on a crosscountry road trip to California in order to get with a girl his friend hooked up for him. However another college student named Alison is also going on this trip to see her boyfriend but of course they hate each other. However as the trip goes on feelings begin to change. So what about The Sure Thing? John Cusack despite his tender age really handled himself quite maturely. He delivered a funny and sentimental performance as a college boy just trying to do what many college boys want to do. I also liked the performance of Daphne Zuniga as Alison. She is quite abrasive and a loudmouth at times but she reminds me of some people of days past. Overall The Sure Thing is a sweet movie that introduced Cusack to stardom as he would go to have a rather solid career. There may be nothing entirely new about the film but then again it's the how not the what. The movie ages well especially for one that is thirty years old. A very touching sentimental film. My Grade A".

Walter 'Gib' Gibson John Cusack of Sixteen Candles and his best friend Lance Anthony Edwards of Top Gun graduate from high school and head off to opposite ends of the nation to attend college. Eventually Lance sets Walter up with a hot babe Nicollette Sheridan but he has no means of transportation. At the same time Alison Bradbury Daphne Zuniga needs a ride to California during the Christmas break to visit her bespectacled boyfriend Jason Boyd Gaines who is in for a surprise. Inevitably the two wind up together in the same car a Volkswagon station wagon driven by Gary Cooper Tim Robbins and his girlfriend. Our hero and heroine don't last long with Gary and his girlfriend after she bares her breasts during the ride and flaunts them to another vehicle whose occupants had mooned them. After the cops cite Gary for her promiscuous behavior he leaves Gib and the girl on the roadside and they have to thumb a ride to get to the land of sun and fun. Harmless fun from start to finish with nothing heavy in between and dreamy Nicollette Sheridan as the eponymous babe in her cinematic debut The Sure Thing qualifies as a sure thing. Nobodyat least guyswill forget Nicollette's first scene when she sprawls out on the beach and oils up her lithe body as the waves crash behind her. According to Reiner he was so nervous that he didn't show up for this scene and let his director of photography lense it. Lots of hit music tunes enliven this sweet little comedy that Rob Reiner directs. For the record Henry Wrinkler produced The Sure Thing.".

It's about young love it's funny and the acting is perfect. Rob Reiner had a sure touch as a director in those days. The two leads John Cusack Gib and Daphne Zuniga Alison are terrific.Gib attends a small college in New England and is considered cute by some of the girls. Unfortunately his awful chat up lines sabotage his chances of getting laid. Zuniga's character seems repressed takes life too seriously and seems to have no sense of humor. Gib tells his best friend Lance Anthony Edwardsabout his problems with women. Lance takes pity and organizes a tryst with the The Sure Thing Nicollette Sheridan of Desperate Housewives fame. Alison's boyfriend is a nerdy law student and coincidentally attends Lance's college in California. Gib and Alison take a road trip to the West Coast together. The film has plot similarities to It Happened One Night as it involves an incompatible couple who fall in and out of love. Reiner later directed When Harry Met Sally. In Harry he explores what would happen if the couple still hated each other after the road trip but fall in love years later. Although Harry was more commercially successful I prefer The Sure Thing. The acting is better and it's hard to believe that Meg Ryan would have problems finding a date or even be interested in Billy Crystal. The Sure Thing is a formulaic romantic comedy but it's the energy of the cast and the writing that make it fun and touching.".

	schema:headline " Magnificent bizarre suspense film by the French Hitchcock";
	schema:reviewBody "This intense study of suspicion and intrigue is devoted to the theme of 'whom can you trust?' with the answer being 'no one'. HenriGeorges Clouzot was a true master of suspense known as 'the French Hitchcock' and he decided here to study spies in the way that an entomologist studies beetles watching them scurry and turn over on their backs and die. Here numerous people lie sweating in bed many of them die and all are betraying one another. They scurry around as if they smell something and maybe they do but often it is poison. One fires bullets through a door at an unknown enemy several kill their deputies or assistants or proteges and everyone is nervous. The Russians and the Americans both want to kill a physicist who knows too much.

The complexities are so intricate and the betrayals so compulsive that one realizes this is not just a thriller it is a scientific study of just what its title says 'spies' those deeply psychologically disturbed people whose sole restless compulsion is to search and betray.

	onyx:emotionText "This intense study of suspicion and intrigue is devoted to the theme of 'whom can you trust?' with the answer being 'no one'. HenriGeorges Clouzot was a true master of suspense known as 'the French Hitchcock' and he decided here to study spies in the way that an entomologist studies beetles watching them scurry and turn over on their backs and die. Here numerous people lie sweating in bed many of them die and all are betraying one another. They scurry around as if they smell something and maybe they do but often it is poison. One fires bullets through a door at an unknown enemy several kill their deputies or assistants or proteges and everyone is nervous. The Russians and the Americans both want to kill a physicist who knows too much.

Before too long the actual German guy himself turns up and who of course will turn out to be...well i'm not going to say.Who can the poor doctor trust? Nobody but the mute woman who seems to have a rather large crush on our good doctor and the heavily sedated gastric patient who were both there before the night the secret agent made him this million dollar propisition it seems. This doesn't stop hefty overly friendly and creepily passive aggressive Russian Peter Ustinovand a constantly rationalizing and fear mongering older professor from constantly turning up and explaining to the good doctor just what is what and whom is whom and generally causing confusion. When the German man does turn up and the doctor does do his best to shelter him amidst the serious chaos. even tho the German man can very much take care of himselfway way better then the well meaning but completely over his head good doctor can and well things just spiral more and more out of control plot wise from there. Suffice it to say that the three people i just mentioned in addition to the fake receptionist are all serving cross purposes and are constantly leaving red herrings and massive doublespeak in their wake causing the good doctor to have a hard time trying to keep up with what the latest info is that he needs to know.This is all actually fun for a good hour or so but then the film more or less descends into a little bit of confusion as too many things the various people are telling the good doctor are taken to be the truth or taken to be lies. I realize the fun is supposed to be in figuring out the truth alongside the good doctor but when he eventually does and tries to do everything he can about itit all starts to seem rather pointless. Also the longer this goes on the more you want to ask yourself exactly why is he still trying to get this all straight again? the money is already in your pocket brojust take it and run! which is of course exactly why the first secet agent picked him in the bar back in the beginning Questions about motivation asidethe ending leaves you with a good nasty jolt and that queasy expression you see on the good doctor's face will definitely mirror your own as the deeper implications of the doctor's position at the end of the movie sink in. Of course I don't actually know if that will be as true for you as it was for me i thought it was a really effective endingbut I also really like ironic Twilight Zone style endings in which the hero doesn't exactly get what he wants but sort of achieves his goals even if they're far different then the way he'd imagined it to be. Its not exactly a realistic ending cause i doubt anything in this movie is realistic but i feel like its a smarter ending then most of the espionage movies of this era usually get its an ending that's actually quite worthy of the best of Hitchcock himself of whose work this movie truly and seriously resembles on a side note this movie also more or less reminds me as a whole of the long forgotten 1980's Donald Sutherland spy caper The Trouble With Spies which while played for laughs does in fact echo this plot in several key ways.".

It was the perfect atmosphere for HenriGeorges Clouzot to release LES ESPIONS THE SPIES upon the world. A less celebrated film than the director's other films of the period THE SPIES nevertheless wages a war of nerves upon a level equal to that in THE WAGES OF FEAR or DIABOLIQUE and keeps its sense of humour as well.Running out of patients money and hope psychiatrist Dr. Malik Grard Sty makes a deal with the devil. In this case the devil presents himself as an American Intelligence Officer Paul Carpenter who offers five million francs if Malik will keep a special guest identified only as Alex for a few days at his rundown sanitarium. Malik is told that this person is of interest to foreign powers and that there may be strangers looking for him. The desperate Malik accepts one million francs as a deposit a bundle of bills that grows increasingly heavy as he awakes the next morning to find that his staff has been enigmatically replaced during the night and that the strangers he was forewarned of have begun popping up even before the arrival of the mysterious Alex.From this point on neither Malik nor the audience know what is true or who to believe. Both the friendly American Mr. Cooper Sam Jaffe and the affable Eastern European Kiminsky Peter Ustinov ooze menace from the chinks in their veneer of civility and nothing and no one can be trusted  not the child playing in the road the bartender across the street and certainly not the mysterious Alex Curd Jrgens hiding his identity behind dark glasses and leather gloves. Yet for everyone involved except Malik all of this is business as usual and the sheer ridiculousness of this contrast brings a dark humour to the proceedings.In fact the greatest weakness of THE SPIES comes in the film's last fifteen minutes when Clouzot unwisely lifts the veil of uncertainty and makes all clear. There is no great revelation that stuns the audience only explanation which washes away the wonderfully absurd grays that have fuelled the film up to this point in favour of a black and white clarity that weakens the film. Clouzot attempts in the film's final two scenes to recover what he imprudently surrendered a dozen minutes earlier but THE SPIES would have been a far finer film if the last reel had never existed.Less easily seen than some of Clouzot's other work THE SPIES has been given a respectable release on DVD in the UK.".

	schema:reviewBody "This absurdist satire of a world gone mad is a creepy delight. SPOILER ALERT! The final scene is a real chiller with the asylum keeper suddenly realising that in an utterly insane world the sane man is regarded as mad  and indeed is so to all intents and purposes.Like Kubrick's later 'Dr. Strangelove' the terrors of the H bomb are effectively used to create an uneasy comedy that finally lurches into horror as the increasingly eccentric pursuit of the secret of the 'H3' superweapon spins out of control distorting reality itself in the process.The twitterings of the Ocarina Players' Convention the storm of feathers bursting as it were out of the frustration of a mute female patient a mystery man called 'Vogel' bird and the harsh squawking of the insistent and threatening telephone All these are memorable elements in a film as darkly humorous as anything by Hitchcock.Curiously I was often reminded of the quiet lunacy which threatens to engulf the two main characters in Alan Plater's TV trilogy that begins with 'The Beiderbecke Affair'! Both film and TV series no doubt owe much to the inheritance of Kafka showing as they each do the spectacle of people struggling to make sense out of their irrational and arbitrary fates.The lack of any innovation in the cinematic technique of 'Les Espions' should not blind us to Clouzot's masterly creation therein of a world of ultimately inescapable horror.This is a great film and one to be viewed repeatedly.".

The final scene is a real chiller with the asylum keeper suddenly realising that in an utterly insane world the sane man is regarded as mad  and indeed is so to all intents and purposes.Like Kubrick's later 'Dr. Strangelove' the terrors of the H bomb are effectively used to create an uneasy comedy that finally lurches into horror as the increasingly eccentric pursuit of the secret of the 'H3' superweapon spins out of control distorting reality itself in the process.The twitterings of the Ocarina Players' Convention the storm of feathers bursting as it were out of the frustration of a mute female patient a mystery man called 'Vogel' bird and the harsh squawking of the insistent and threatening telephone All these are memorable elements in a film as darkly humorous as anything by Hitchcock.Curiously I was often reminded of the quiet lunacy which threatens to engulf the two main characters in Alan Plater's TV trilogy that begins with 'The Beiderbecke Affair'! Both film and TV series no doubt owe much to the inheritance of Kafka showing as they each do the spectacle of people struggling to make sense out of their irrational and arbitrary fates.The lack of any innovation in the cinematic technique of 'Les Espions' should not blind us to Clouzot's masterly creation therein of a world of ultimately inescapable horror.This is a great film and one to be viewed repeatedly.";

	schema:reviewBody "The head doctor of a failing sanatorium accepts a million francs from a mysterious government agent to harbour a new fake patient. This new inmate is said to be an inventor of a new devastating nuclear device as a consequence a swarm of international spies are drawn to the hospital.Les Espions is a film directed by HenriGeorges Clouzot who was tagged as the French Hitchcock before that term was applied later to Claude Chabrol. He rose to prominence with films such as the suspense classic Les Diaboliques 1955. Les Espions is a much less wellknown film in fairness this is probably partially as a result of it being a less successful end product. It has a much more ambiguous tone to it with it starting out for the most part as a black comedy which by the end turns deadly serious. It's an unusual combination and one which I'm not sure entirely works with the sillier story elements working against the more serious undertones. I actually thought the ending was very good and the darker aspects more successful but I felt they were lessened a little by the more lighthearted comic tone that made up much of the earlier part of the film which was a sort of spies vs. spies scenario with the hapless doctor in the middle constantly wondering who can be trusted? I think this is one of those movies which would be improved on a rewatch given that once you know what it isn't as much as what it is I expect it will be much easier to get into its rhythm and get on board with its unusual tone. On first viewing I found this to be somewhat uneven yet aspects of it definitely left me intrigued. Even if the whole doesn't fit together perfectly this is still certainly a film with a bit of originality.".

Although I had known that Peter Ustinov found it stupid I hoped he had a runin with the director and the film is quite okay. It is not. After a few minutes so many idiotic things happen it is hard to believe. Many famous actors appear in the film but the main story is carried by someone completely incompetent. The plot is so stupid that I don't want to mention it as it sounds like being written by an inmate of a lunatic asylum. It was not only boring but aggravating! This should warn you not to buy the DVD as I have done after reading the other comments.".

Ethan Hawke in his first work as a director has tried to capture the feeling of these modern beatniks who reside in the Chelsea Hotel in NYC and have chosen for themselves a way of life that is different than the kind of life our society would consider successful. These people aren't even artists they're just artist wannabes.  A little boy says it very clearly It's hard to say who really is a poet these days. What makes them interesting and what they have in common is that they can't stand the modern world their perspective on life and the belief that happiness is in simple things. There are several moments in this film that make that so clear. One of them is when Val tells Audrey played brilliantly by Rosario Dawson We only have 43 dollars and her answer is We're just living Val.  Lots of people do that.. While I was watching this film I was thinking of something I had heard in Charlie Kauffman's 'Adaptation'. In real life nothing really happens and I think that's exactly what Ethan Hawke's purpose is to show us the life of some not so ordinary people who however have feelings and ordinary problems. Ethan Hawke has a wonderful script in his hands but he fails to deliver and that's the most diappointing thing about this film. But other than that this film has so many beautiful poetic moments that it's worth watching. I understand though that if you never dreamed of this kind of life if everything that you think matters is to make money in order to afford the comforts of modern life then this film will never appeal to you.".

From stage to screen the integrity of this modern fairytale was not only preserved but heightened by Hawke's abstract depiction of the hotel and its tenants. Captivating visuals and a kind of sensual stillness give the film a lulling quality with a nearflawless cast and hypnotic monologue. The score developed by none other than the incredible Jeff Tweedy rounds things off to a smooth edge. I myself was highly impressed by the subtle references to the artists of the past. Some were apparent from the beginning Bukowski Ginsberg Cassidy Dylan while others crept up from the corners of the story embedding themselves in the minds of audience members everywhere. It's a film you've got to see beyond the picture. A film not fit for the short attention span. A film intended to pull you down into the depths of madness toss you around at the violent hand of love sing you to sleep and wake you back up in the morning. Yes Hawke has done it again and this time he's done it with jazz and cigarettes.Key Moments The Poem The Speech The Session The Madman The Drunk Best Performance A surprisingly stunning delivery from Rosario Dawson".

The film was shot over a period of 16 days using Sony PD100 digital cameras.  As for the writing and characters that have been belittled these characters are not entirely the creation of screenwriter Nicole Burdette the story was inspired by the play Under Milk Wood by a man called Dylan Thomas you may have heard of him... if you haven't go to school and then come back and critique this movie.  Thomas actually resided in the Chelsea at one point in time as well as Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen.  And if you didn't enjoy the music of the film by WilcoJeff Tweedy... shame on you.

I seriously doubt it.  I don't think it was something that Hawke removed just for the film.  The script is made up mostly of behavior.  Behavior is the kind of thing that serious writers work very hard to expunge from their work in an effort to get to the real meat  the story or narrative the thing that the writer needs to say.  Chelsea Walls is not that.  It plunges the viewer into behavior without any effort to explain what you're watching or who the characters are.  This is definitely not what most people expect or want when they go to the movies.Still though the actors are very capable and they are mostly really wonderful to watch.  If Burdette had given them the telephone directory to read they probably would have made it at least a little interesting to sit and watch for a while just because of who they are.  What Hawke his editor and cameraman have put together here is an ultimately haunting and very poetic experience.  I too like others have found it very hard to get out of my system.  Images and moments from the film still haunt me.  There are bits that are true and extremely beautiful in this film things that are very keenly observed.  That I believe is what Ethan Hawke brought to Burdette's script.It was never a very commercial project but jeez all the stones that people are hurling at him seem a little excessive.".

Scenes go on excruciatingly long saying nothing and begging for an editor and worse not even creating a mood for any substantial ideas to build on. It seems that the ONLY rational idea that comes out of this hodgepodge of illdefined selfpitying and pitiful characters is no more than that old hackneyed clich that somehow if you are a drunk an addict or a looser  or better yet all of the above then any gibberish issuing forth from your mouth or your pen MUST be high art.Of course this is nonsense. But it seems that the director has incorporated that misnomer as his own filmmaking style  evidently he feels that all he has to do is aim a camera and shoot without benefit of script or even a vague notion of what should happen from point A to point B without adequate lighting or even a simple focus puller and that will somehow the resultant murky low contrast dark in many scenes barely visible and mostly outoffocus images will rise to Film Festival Winner quality. This too is film student's clich and it is dead wrong. Hopefully by the senior year they have either learned how wrong this is or they have flunked out. I am afraid Mr. Hawke is about to flunk out.If you think it is fun to sit and watch Kris Kristofferson play a falling down drooling nearly incoherent drunk then by all means knock yourself out. If you think you will be entertained by an endless string of poorly lit scenes in which the characters are barely visible while they spout nonsense lines supposedly odes to the famous artists who once populated that hotel like Bob Dylan  however Dylan they certainly are not then by all means hunker down because CHELSEA WALLS is peppered with this kind of aimless pointless dialogue it's the poetic meat of the film or so Ethan Hawke keeps telling the hosts on the string of talk shows he's visited in the last week to promote this unpleasant ohsoserious trash even Andy Warhol's TRASH had sense enough to laugh at itself.The film's director keeps bragging that it only cost him 100000 to make. It looks it. It feels it. Now there certainly have been plenty of films out of Hollywood that cost hundreds of millions and nevertheless wound up being nothing but garbage but at least in those they had enough money to pay for key and fill lights so you could at least see the garbage that was going on.If this is what videotofilm is going to engender  all those actors who think they can be directors because they can cough up enough money to direct a vanity movie then please in the spirit of truthinadvertising let it be clearly stated on the marquee before we plunk down our 10.50  This film was made with a video camera for less money than most productions spend on sandwiches for the crew  enter at your own risk.".

This too is film student's clich and it is dead wrong. Hopefully by the senior year they have either learned how wrong this is or they have flunked out. I am afraid Mr. Hawke is about to flunk out.If you think it is fun to sit and watch Kris Kristofferson play a falling down drooling nearly incoherent drunk then by all means knock yourself out. If you think you will be entertained by an endless string of poorly lit scenes in which the characters are barely visible while they spout nonsense lines supposedly odes to the famous artists who once populated that hotel like Bob Dylan  however Dylan they certainly are not then by all means hunker down because CHELSEA WALLS is peppered with this kind of aimless pointless dialogue it's the poetic meat of the film or so Ethan Hawke keeps telling the hosts on the string of talk shows he's visited in the last week to promote this unpleasant ohsoserious trash even Andy Warhol's TRASH had sense enough to laugh at itself.The film's director keeps bragging that it only cost him 100000 to make. It looks it. It feels it. Now there certainly have been plenty of films out of Hollywood that cost hundreds of millions and nevertheless wound up being nothing but garbage but at least in those they had enough money to pay for key and fill lights so you could at least see the garbage that was going on.If this is what videotofilm is going to engender  all those actors who think they can be directors because they can cough up enough money to direct a vanity movie then please in the spirit of truthinadvertising let it be clearly stated on the marquee before we plunk down our 10.50  This film was made with a video camera for less money than most productions spend on sandwiches for the crew  enter at your own risk.";

I watched the film with a mix of awe at it's lack of vanity and strangely lack of emotional reaction.  However when I wandered alone into the streets of Austin I found myself overwhelmed by an instant need to plant myself on a bench with paper and pen...and words flowed from me as they only do when I am truly inspired by another artists work.After allowing myself to act as an external vehicle for the spirit of Chelsea Walls I was able to reflect on the film itself.  It is one of the few films I have EVER seen that tapped into the true essence of poetry and the true nature of an artist.  I felt connected to the plight of the characters since it has been too often that I've felt the self destructiveness that accompanies artistic pursuit that is founded in the belief that the most profound art is born in emotional turmoil.  Both the acting and storytelling were superb.I was fortunate enough to sit beside Ethan and Rick Linklater during a documentary the following day.  It was only after ranting about Chelsea Walls Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater and how I would love to meet them and pick their brains to a random girl who sat to my right that I realized that they sat just to my left.  My embarrassment was quickly crushed by both Ethan and Rick's friendly demeanors. My words to Ethan then were obscured by the fact that I was blown away by Linklater's presence and how kind and funny they both seemed.  So Ethan if you read this props to you for staying true to your roots as an artist and making such an authentic directorial debut....Jen".

	schema:reviewBody "The Chelsea Hotel is a landmark in American culture alas due to modern advances in lowincome housing it has become nothing more than a demolished idea coupled with a forgotten past. Hawke using nearly every technique patented by Richard Linklater attempts to revitalize the forgotten hotel with nonsequitur stories and impossible characters yet incredible actors. Using nowclich camera style a.k.a. The grain of pure film school and a powerful score by Wilco Hawke pulls every grunge independent filmmaker technique known to man mashes them together like potatoes and hopes  actually prays  that it will be a big hurrah at the cinematic Thanksgiving. Enough references for now but truthfully Hawke creates an eyesore of a film with Chelsea Walls'. Beginning with characters that never develop AT ALL coupling with a story that is never existent Hawke horribly displays whatever talent he may have thought he had by employing friends to carry the burden. Chelsea Walls was a smear on cinema not because of the subject of which I do believe an honest film needs to be made of the events leading to the demise of this building but because of the surroundings. Hawke borrows as mentioned before unsuccessfully from Linklater's work attempting to bring a Waking Lifeesquire story to the surface sans the animation. Where Hawke failed was that he brought unexcited characters into a place that really needed an introduction. He needed to guide this audience through his train of thought  not just assume we were all as intellectual as he portrayed himself to be.What upped me about this film was that we had intelligent powerful actors giving us nothing. From the beginning of the scene until the end there was nothing solid for us to stand. Kris Kristofferson is a phenomenal actor but he couldn't bring me to the surface in Chelsea Walls. He cried he drank he womanized but for what purpose  this critic has absolutely no idea why. The same can be said for Natasha Richardson whom in my eyes cannot do wrong was misguided from the beginning thanks to Mr. Hawke. Rosario Dawson gave the only comprehensible portrayal throughout the film but she was flanked by horrid direction and choppy antiindependent clich surroundings. She tried but Hawke wouldn't allow her to prosper. The only one that went the distance albeit horribly was Robert Sean Leonard who only was given screen time because of his friendship with director Hawke. He did have a moving story and if we were left with just the central focus of Leonard's character as he interacted with the others of this building I think we could have had a keeper of a film but we didn't. We jumped. We jumped from one actor to another hoping that we could see the chaos surrounding these talented artists. Alas all we witnessed was Jello slipping down a wall  nothing was sticking.I hate to be pessimistic because I had high hopes for this film. Look at the billing for Chelsea Walls who wouldn't get excited. What did happen is that Hawke went to the Linklater school of direction but abysmally failed out possibly never quite going to the first class but instead just copying someone's notes. This was a dark depressing tale that had elements that could work but just like any first year filmmaker it all depends on how you put those ideas together. Hawke had some great ideas but he could not assemble them. He tried to bring music into the scene and the use of Wilco was genuine but overbearing  not to mention overused  throughout the film. This seemed to be the common theme or pedestal that Hawke used for Chelsea Walls  overuse until it becomes painful to the viewer. You can obviously see that with the extra lacktastic features attached to this disc. There are some additional scenes which only continue the abrasive unknown of the film. There are some interviews but done many years after the film. Hawke tries his best but the funniest is Robert Sean Leonard who forgets everything and attempts to change the subject. My favorite What was your favorite scene Mr. Leonard answered with a long pause and the phrase anything with Rosario. That sums this film up in a nutshell.Overall I cannot suggest this film. I love the actor Ethan Hawke and I like this style of filmmaking but for Chelsea Walls it just didn't seem put together. Linklater would have been upset with the results  just as we were as we watched it. Do not be fooled by the big names associated here they accomplish nothing and in the end make you want this hotel to be torn down. This was a sad attempt at filmmaking and I can only suggest watching a better combination film with these actors called Tape. I have mentioned this in a couple of other reviews and truly believe this is the best HawkesLeonardLinklater combo platter you will ever get.Grade   out of ".

Where Hawke failed was that he brought unexcited characters into a place that really needed an introduction. He needed to guide this audience through his train of thought  not just assume we were all as intellectual as he portrayed himself to be.What upped me about this film was that we had intelligent powerful actors giving us nothing. From the beginning of the scene until the end there was nothing solid for us to stand. Kris Kristofferson is a phenomenal actor but he couldn't bring me to the surface in Chelsea Walls. He cried he drank he womanized but for what purpose  this critic has absolutely no idea why. The same can be said for Natasha Richardson whom in my eyes cannot do wrong was misguided from the beginning thanks to Mr. Hawke. Rosario Dawson gave the only comprehensible portrayal throughout the film but she was flanked by horrid direction and choppy antiindependent clich surroundings. She tried but Hawke wouldn't allow her to prosper. The only one that went the distance albeit horribly was Robert Sean Leonard who only was given screen time because of his friendship with director Hawke. He did have a moving story and if we were left with just the central focus of Leonard's character as he interacted with the others of this building I think we could have had a keeper of a film but we didn't. We jumped. We jumped from one actor to another hoping that we could see the chaos surrounding these talented artists. Alas all we witnessed was Jello slipping down a wall  nothing was sticking.I hate to be pessimistic because I had high hopes for this film. Look at the billing for Chelsea Walls who wouldn't get excited. What did happen is that Hawke went to the Linklater school of direction but abysmally failed out possibly never quite going to the first class but instead just copying someone's notes. This was a dark depressing tale that had elements that could work but just like any first year filmmaker it all depends on how you put those ideas together. Hawke had some great ideas but he could not assemble them. He tried to bring music into the scene and the use of Wilco was genuine but overbearing  not to mention overused  throughout the film. This seemed to be the common theme or pedestal that Hawke used for Chelsea Walls  overuse until it becomes painful to the viewer. You can obviously see that with the extra lacktastic features attached to this disc. There are some additional scenes which only continue the abrasive unknown of the film. There are some interviews but done many years after the film. Hawke tries his best but the funniest is Robert Sean Leonard who forgets everything and attempts to change the subject. My favorite What was your favorite scene Mr. Leonard answered with a long pause and the phrase anything with Rosario. That sums this film up in a nutshell.Overall I cannot suggest this film. I love the actor Ethan Hawke and I like this style of filmmaking but for Chelsea Walls it just didn't seem put together. Linklater would have been upset with the results  just as we were as we watched it. Do not be fooled by the big names associated here they accomplish nothing and in the end make you want this hotel to be torn down. This was a sad attempt at filmmaking and I can only suggest watching a better combination film with these actors called Tape. I have mentioned this in a couple of other reviews and truly believe this is the best HawkesLeonardLinklater combo platter you will ever get.Grade   out of ";

The use of sound is especially impressive as music and conversation will bleed over into a new scene with new characters like sound travels through hotel walls giving the film a dreamlike quality. Also impressive is the number of characters and story lines the film carries as can be seen by the list of characters. The film cuts between the numerous story lines and then returns to them in a masterful way that never leaves you lost. It's not a happy film and offers little in the way of redemption except perhaps in the young Vietnamese poet's capacity for love yet the use of music poetry and the mesmerizing way the stories are folded together and told make the movie a lovely and insightful viewing experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "This has to be one of the most unfairly underrated film in movie history. It's a perfect film and much better than any other De Palma film I am a big fan of De Palma but this film is just perfect. Exdrug dealer Carlito Brigante recently released from prison tries to live a decent live while dealing with the ever present temptations of going back to it's old one mostly from his friends who aren't very happy with the idea of Carlito becoming a decent citizen. He is always accompanied by his best friend and lawyer David Kleinfeld who is a coke addicted and increasingly paranoid lawyer with dubious connections in the mob world. As you can see with friends like these it would be a hard job for Carlito to abandon his old life. However he finds strength and inspiration to continue his efforts of cleaning his act by reuniting with his old love from before he went to jail Gail. This story is a perfect thriller whose structure and development feels a lot like a Greek tragedy reinterpreted as a film noir. There are few action sequences but the dialog is so perfect that you just want to know more and more about the characters. The few action sequences are beautifully filmed and i assure you you will not be disappointed they will keep you on the edge of your seat. The performances are great Pacino gives a great Humphrey Bogartlike performance as the excon always tormented by his past the narration is also great it clearly shows us how Carlito is feeling and how i think an excon would think trying to clean his act with temptations in every corner. Sean Penn gives an academy award worthy performance by giving a believable approach to Carlito's increasingly drug addicted paranoid and even homicidal lawyer. The beautiful Penelope Ann Miller gives us a wonderful performance as Carlito's only positive influence and inspiration in his life I think this performance should have established her as strong leading lady but as i said this movie doesn't have even half of the recognition it deserves. All in all Is a great movie and personally one of my all time favorites if not favorite. Great Performances Perfect Film.".

He is always accompanied by his best friend and lawyer David Kleinfeld who is a coke addicted and increasingly paranoid lawyer with dubious connections in the mob world. As you can see with friends like these it would be a hard job for Carlito to abandon his old life. However he finds strength and inspiration to continue his efforts of cleaning his act by reuniting with his old love from before he went to jail Gail. This story is a perfect thriller whose structure and development feels a lot like a Greek tragedy reinterpreted as a film noir. There are few action sequences but the dialog is so perfect that you just want to know more and more about the characters. The few action sequences are beautifully filmed and i assure you you will not be disappointed they will keep you on the edge of your seat. The performances are great Pacino gives a great Humphrey Bogartlike performance as the excon always tormented by his past the narration is also great it clearly shows us how Carlito is feeling and how i think an excon would think trying to clean his act with temptations in every corner. Sean Penn gives an academy award worthy performance by giving a believable approach to Carlito's increasingly drug addicted paranoid and even homicidal lawyer. The beautiful Penelope Ann Miller gives us a wonderful performance as Carlito's only positive influence and inspiration in his life I think this performance should have established her as strong leading lady but as i said this movie doesn't have even half of the recognition it deserves. All in all Is a great movie and personally one of my all time favorites if not favorite. Great Performances Perfect Film.";

As mentioned before in a previous review Carlito's way is Scarface with feeling. Simply involving. I would dare say it does leave you on the edge of your chair with great anticipation probably due to Pacino's on screen presence and experienced acting mannerisms.

And then there is some romance mixed in with the story of a gangster trying to reform himself.I didn't like the romantic scenes myself...thought they interrupted the flow of the story...hence I gave it a 9 instead of a 10! There is also some clichd dialogue. I happen to be a big Pacino fan and so I am being a little bit though not entirely biased and am sidelining all these things. If you excuse these small potatoes this one is a great flick from start to finish very entertaining with some fantastic performances from the supporting cast e.g. Sean Penn. Special mention also of Viggo Mortensen who comes in for a short role but plays the part wonderfully.As for Al Pacino in lead role he makes sure he steals the show as usual. Brilliant!".

	schema:reviewBody "I've dropped myself into straightforward character pieces in order to explore that form and reap its values. But you are sort of restricted visually when your first requirement is to tell a fairly straightforward story. So I'd like to go back and develop pure visual storytelling. Because to me it's one of the most exciting aspects of making movies and almost a lost art at this point.  Brian De PalmaThere's a scene in Brian De Palma's Carlito's Way in which Al Pacino stands outside his lover's door watching as she slowly undresses. Pacino pants like a dog in heat salivating over the beauty of her naked body. Unable to contain himself he breaks the door down and lunges for his woman their lips locking as he embraces her soft flesh. De Palma's camera then giddily circles the couple You Are So Beautiful blazing on the soundtrack. The moment of passion escalates the camera circling faster and faster their feverish kisses becoming more wet more sloppy until she looks into Pacino's eyes and says Where's my cheesecake?It is with moments like these that director Brian De Palma acknowledges that Carlito's Way is one giant slice of cheese. This is art for art's sake a purely formal exercise in which De Palma indulges his fetish for sexy aesthetics. He pushes every motion and emotion to operatic proportions ringing every ounce of drama from what is really a fairly generic plot. With its impeccable compositions precise camera work glacial tracking shots baroque tone sublime action sequences and flamboyant acting this is a film in love with its own form. But for a film so preoccupied with surfaces it's remarkable how much emotion De Palma wrings out of his cast. De Palma has a fondness for bad actors often deliberately casting them as props or undermining their performances. Indeed his leading men Michael J Fox Josh Hartnett John Travolta etc are often clueless actors who themselves play clueless characters and his leading women Melanie Griffith Scarlett Johansson Rebecca Romjin Nancy Allen etc are often models or vacuous pretty faces who likewise play airheads hookers or prostitutes. This is a guy preoccupied with surface beauty even as his films are explicitly preoccupied with the dirty veneer behind such surfaces Redacted for example is about the lie behind beautifully composed photographs. And even when De Palma does cast genuine talent Pacino Penn Lithgow he has them play larger than life characters their raging opera performances designed to match his shamelessly grandiose vision.In Carlito's Way De Palma has Al Pacino play Carlito Brigante an ageing gangster who has recently been released from jail. Carlito is determined to go straight staying out of trouble until he can amass enough money to retire to some paradisaical tropic island. It's a generic plot but Pacino and De Palma mesh so perfectly that the film eventually transcends its B movie premise and becomes at times something a bit more sublime. Odd for a gangster movie Way aligns itself firmly with the world of noir. Gangster movies typically follow a fairly obvious narrative progression. We get rise the good times and the fall the bad times. Carlito's Way is odd in that it treats the fall as a forgone conclusion its dying protagonist narrating his death dream like Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity. This is a conspiratorial world Carlito pulled around like a puppet on a string by some unseen cosmic noir God. Indeed upon being released from jail every action Carlito does every choice he makes is righteous and admirable. And yet noir fatalism thwarts him at every turn his choices unable to halt an almost predetermined finale. And so the Way of the film's title refers both to Carlito's spiritual path his newfound desire to be good and do right but also something more inexorable the way the fixed route. Rehabilitated or not Carlito's tragedy is that there was never any chance of escape.And so while in Scarface Pacino's manic performance gelled perfectly with De Palma's cocaine inspired direction in Carlito's Way his forlorn eyes mesh flawlessly with De Palma's melancholic visuals. At 53 years of age Pacino's face has never looked this beautifully tragic. Framed by a jet black beard Pacino walks about like Jesus on a good hair day suffering for sins he can not atone. Already dead he spends the film always dressed in black navigating his death dream like a fallen angel. Watch too how Pacino spends the film alternating between a stance of fasttalking macho posturing and one of melancholic regret. He wears the face of a corpse of defeat and acceptance his flashes of confidence a hip old mask which doesn't know if its going or staying.And yet in death Carlito does receive a spiritual redemption of sorts. He may not have escaped his past but he does help his lover a stripper who dreams of being a ballerina escape hers. And so when De Palma chooses to end the film with another airing of You Are So Beautiful we know that the song has a dual function. We celebrates Carlito's newfound spiritual beauty but also the aesthetic beauty of De Palma's filmic world.8.510  Stylish. De Palma's one of the few directors able to convey a sense of true three dimensional space. His crane shots are gorgeous and the film is composed of numerous long takes elegant whip pans and zooms so precise that we switch from long shots to close ups almost imperceptibly. Worth multiple viewings.".

It's not as hyped as 'The Godfather' or 'Scarface' but it's an extremely honest and captivating film that wins you over exactly because it doesn't seem to have been created to make it into film history.All the characters are very well defined so there are no ambiguous or contradicting behaviors. Al Pacino is extremely charismatic convincing the viewer that as well as he can play an Italian or a cuban he can play a puertorican. And his complete change from one character to another is what makes this movie so special among the other great gangster movies.Carlito Brigante is a more mature gangster reformed from his years spent in jail. Differently from Tony Montana Carlito doesn't feel or needs to feel isolated. He reaches out to the people around him. He wants to trust and mainly love. Gail his love interest is put on a pedestal as the person with whom he wants to escape to 'paradise' and the entire film revolves around the expectations and the hope that the viewer feels for this romance that along with Carlito's way out of the crime world would lead them both to the dream life. If Michael Corleone's essence was in honor and Tony Montana's in money Carlito Brigante's is in this sensitivity that make's you forget about his ethnicity or his background which isn't so in 'Scarface'. His body language and his looks as a LatinAmerican also change amazingly compared to Tony Montana.The supporting actors were also amazing mainly Sean Penn that really embraced his character Kleinfeld a stressedout corrupt lawyer who betrays everyone around him. John Leguizamo is also great as 'Benny from the Bronx'.Overall the film is very well paced as it begins with a bit of action when Carlito returns to his neighbourhood goes on revolving around him getting his life back on track and making plans with Gail and ends with the thrilling and greatly edited scenes of the Grand Central Station chase. Finally when he's shot you're left wondering if there was any way out to begin with and if there's really a possibility of 'paradise' even for a reformed gangster like himself.".

	schema:headline " More human than Scarface.";
	schema:reviewBody "Scarface was a great operatic film rooted in Greek tragedy primarily the downfall of its protagonist related to his own hubris and pride. Its overthetop theatrics and scenerychewing acting complemented the absurdist tone of the film some carping critics complained it was too violent but it was silly violence...and it worked.Carlito's Way is considered by many to be a companion piece of sorts to Scarface  but in its own ways it is vastly different. As GoodFellas differed a great deal from Casino in its narrative methods Carlito's Way isn't as broad and theatrical as Scarface. Of course it's still a DePalma film and that means we get some beautiful set pieces  but for the most part DePalma avoids his excessive visuals and instead opts for a balanced mixture of both storyline and directorial flair. It is not a sequel to Scarface  it is an expansion and it seems entirely apt that its narrative is more mature considering that Carlito Brigante the main character is wiser than Tony Montana from Scarface. Carlito is a Puerto Rican excon who gets out of a thirtyyear jail sentence based on a technicality after serving a mere five years of sentence. Faced with a new life and fresh horizons he decides to heed the lessons he learned in jail and embark on a new and honest lifestyle.Scarface was Greek tragedy insofar as Tony Montana was doomed to a downfall based on his own egotism and stubbornness. Like Oedipus in Sophocles' classic story Montana was too bullheaded to take the advice of his wife and friends and was entirely responsible for his own emotional and in Scarface's case physical demise.Carlito's Way is the flip side of the coin. It's still Greek tragedy but it offers a new perspective. This time the protagonist tries to change his fate but his life is doomed to its inevitable conclusion. Carlito tries to change his ways but  to paraphrase a character from another film  there is only one guarantee...Carlito Brigante will never see heaven. That's the fundamental truth of this movie and DePalma's less showy camerawork and the more mature characterizations by the actors and the believable script ensure that Carlito's Way is an entirely human experience  far more so than Scarface. Which is still a great film based on its own goals.".

Its overthetop theatrics and scenerychewing acting complemented the absurdist tone of the film some carping critics complained it was too violent but it was silly violence...and it worked.Carlito's Way is considered by many to be a companion piece of sorts to Scarface  but in its own ways it is vastly different. As GoodFellas differed a great deal from Casino in its narrative methods Carlito's Way isn't as broad and theatrical as Scarface. Of course it's still a DePalma film and that means we get some beautiful set pieces  but for the most part DePalma avoids his excessive visuals and instead opts for a balanced mixture of both storyline and directorial flair. It is not a sequel to Scarface  it is an expansion and it seems entirely apt that its narrative is more mature considering that Carlito Brigante the main character is wiser than Tony Montana from Scarface. Carlito is a Puerto Rican excon who gets out of a thirtyyear jail sentence based on a technicality after serving a mere five years of sentence. Faced with a new life and fresh horizons he decides to heed the lessons he learned in jail and embark on a new and honest lifestyle.Scarface was Greek tragedy insofar as Tony Montana was doomed to a downfall based on his own egotism and stubbornness. Like Oedipus in Sophocles' classic story Montana was too bullheaded to take the advice of his wife and friends and was entirely responsible for his own emotional and in Scarface's case physical demise.Carlito's Way is the flip side of the coin. It's still Greek tragedy but it offers a new perspective. This time the protagonist tries to change his fate but his life is doomed to its inevitable conclusion. Carlito tries to change his ways but  to paraphrase a character from another film  there is only one guarantee...Carlito Brigante will never see heaven. That's the fundamental truth of this movie and DePalma's less showy camerawork and the more mature characterizations by the actors and the believable script ensure that Carlito's Way is an entirely human experience  far more so than Scarface. Which is still a great film based on its own goals.";

	schema:reviewBody "Carlito's Way 1993 is a brilliant cinematic work. Pacino's performance as Carlito Berganzi displays the duplicity and subsequent torment between his reformed spirit and the endless seduction of the street embodied more specifically as his reputationlegacythose who know him of him and those whom he allows in his innermost circle. Sean Penn is phenomenal as the lawyer representing Carlito his metamorphosis into character is testament to his depth of talent. Penelope Ann Miller as the longsuffering love of Carlito's life is dramatically and visually enchanting. The casting is perfect. The supporting cast superb perfectly augmenting the film. The script is alive with literary devices the story lines characters dialogue themes subtextsetc. make this an almost endlessly watchable film. Of this genre Its all there action suspense violence confrontations chases  prerequisite street and wise guy character profiling with the right dialogue to make it work. Directed executed and rendered a cinema great. Carlito's Way is atypical of the gangster genre although it adheres to certain basics. It is also  a love story not boy meets girl ad nauseum but real destined soul mates wrenched apart and thrown back together five years later by some abberation of fate. As one experiences spiritualmoral disintegration the other the antithesis. Carlito's Way is a mix of genre's veiled with diligent artistic discretion. I even see certain thematic similarities to Casablanca. Watching Carlito's Way I had the feeling that De Palma wanted to resurrect and redeem poor old Tony Montana Scarface 1983. Perhaps it was selfredemption or a means to a great film with a second view or maybe the fun of bringing back that great ensemble of talent based on a similar theme. A sequel of sorts not to diminish either film in anyway. Released exactly ten years after Scarface the comparisons are more than obvious. Ten years later De Palma and Pacino. Oliver Stone missing but another great script. In Carlito's Way Pacino again plays a Hispanic drug lord. Now Puerto Rican in New York City before Cuban in Miami. Now drug lord repentant whereas in Scarface drug lord vehemently unrepentant and devoid of remorse from beginning to surrealistic end. Instead of classic gangster genre prerequisites employed in Scarface such as coming from the bottom rising in status trust and favour in the eyes of the mob boss eventually killing him and gaining his empire his womanMichelle Pfeiffer. Love? Its not in the equation Carlito only wants to unite with his TRUE LOVE. To redeem himself in her eyes after causing her the heartbreak of losing him forever.Which it would have been if not for the quirk of intervention by Carlito's coke addicted sociopathic lawyer. Carlito seeks solely to prove to his love that he is truly changed honest sincere and even has a plan whereupon they can live happily ever after. Carlito and his girl are likeable. Upon viewing this film one is compelled to empathy wanting them to escape insurmountable odds the almost onmniprescent serpentlike street finding and deserving of happiness as long as they may live. However it is though The Angel of Death has been hidden somewhere in every frame of De Palma's film casting a shadow waiting patiently to put his hand upon...Even the ancillary characters from Scarface are brought back in legions for Carlito's Way. Carlito's Way is Scarface with feelings. Which is another similarity in the two films feelings is the Achille's Heel of both Carlito Berganzi and Tony Montana. I also believe both films were vastly underrated and overlooked by the mainstream media but upon populist vote they are both widely esteemed as classic. I'd give Carlito's Way 1993 nine out of ten. If I saw a ten it would be a life changing event.".

	schema:headline " Al Pacino's best film performance post1990!";
	schema:reviewBody "CARLITO'S WAY 1993 is the real best Al Pacino performance after 1990. Love him in his Oscarwinning role in SCENT OF A WOMAN 1992 it's not as overrated as people say and he is infectiously good in that. But in CARLITO'S WAY Mr. Pacino plays the more difficult role of Carlito Brigante who deserves as much respect as Michael Corleone or Tony Montana! I've got to preface the rest of my review by saying that I've seen this film a bunch of times starting with right after it first came out in the early 90s and have loved it ever since. It is one of those films that has EVERYTHING in it that will appeal to anyone. You like Action? CHECK...Romance? CHECK...Drama? CHECK...Thrills? CHECK...Humor? CHECK...This is one of the rare films that has it all!The legendary Pacino seemed to specialize in playing ambitious crafty respected gangsters and Carlito is no exception in those general aspects but in this film Carlito is in large parts different from both Corleone or Montana whereas both Corleone and Montana were very powerful men that controlled empire throughout the bulk of their films Carlito WAS a powerful gangster who lost his empire and did jail time also Corleone and Montana were inherently suspicious and possessive men to the point of being paranoid and dare I say it inherently evil whereas Carlito was justifiably suspicious but also ironically forgiving and accepting of other people's shortcomings and at his core a GOOD man! The other 2 men chose to live a certain way and either never tried to redeem himself Corleone or never had a chance Montana but Carlito has lived the hard gangster lifestyle paid for his sins and now wants redemption and to start anew. From the moment the film starts in 1975 with his courtroom speech the only pure comic moment in the film thanking the judge for releasing him early from his 30year prison sentence he only served 5 years to the very end the viewer HAS to root for Carlito Brigante! Carlito upon release wants to start a whole knew life and become legitimate. No more drugdealing no more killings. He wants to play it straight. Carlito's lawyer that gets him off is Dave Kleinfeld played by the great Sean Penn in a superb performance a shady man who is hooked on drugs and has his own troubles as he has stolen money from one of his other imprisoned gangster clients who finds out about it and blackmails Kleinfeld into helping break him out of prison. This is definitely one of my favorite Sean Penn performances and ironically in a supporting role. He's effortless as this scuzzy posing pathetic outofhisleague lawyer and in a way his tale is as tragic as Carlito's.The film's first ironic moment occurs when Carlito's young cousin gets him into a scrape with some lowlevel drug dealers in a crappy ginjointpool hall where Carlito must use his old school cunning and instincts to survive. His cousin had 30000 to make the deal for the drugs but the dealers were going to kill him and keep the drugs and money for themselves. Carlito can't save his inexperienced cousin but outsmarts the dealers and gets away with the money. He uses that money to buy into a partnership with discoowner Sasso. At this point he sees a dancer one night that reminds him of his old girlfriend Gail Penelope Ann Miller in a sexy sweet performance. He seeks out Gail one night after her dance class and they go to a diner to talk about their past and possible future. Honestly I think that beauty is an overrated word and there are even actresses that are supposedly beautiful in real life that don't do it for me on screen but Miller as Gail totally does it for me! Gail is a REAL woman who like Carlito has goals ambitions desires and they complement each other perfectly. Gail is sexy in a very natural way.Things look good for Carlito but feeling he must help Dave out of his scrape he goes along with him the night of the prison escape on a boat with the gangster's son and Dave kills the son against Carlito's wishes. Carlito cleans his hands of Dave. But there is another up and coming gangster Benny Blanco John Leguiziamo in a wonderful performance that has an unhealthy admiration for Carlito and won't leave him alone. So Carlito finds himself surrounded by all these shady types that he can't shake. He decides to run away with Gail who is pregnant.Directed by the great Brian DePalma CARLITO'S WAY is a very authentic period piece as he captures the essence of the 1970s without the film bogging itself down in that time period. The focus is on the characters and the story but has an epic feel with a lot of longview tracking shots an operatic score and Pacino's brilliant narration of his characters thoughts and emotions. The cinematography is amongst the best I've ever seen in a modern film. All these elements perfectly complement the bombastic personality yet contemplative nature of Carlito Brigante. I don't know if I've ever seen a film where virtually all nonhuman elements of the film reminded TOTALLY of it's main character! Another thing...this film is almost 2 and 12 hours long and is NEVER boring! That's an incredible feat in and of itself.Great supporting work is also provided by Luis Guzman as Carlito's right hand man Pachanga James Rebhorn as the D.A. out to nail Kleinfeld Paul Mazursky as the judge who freed Carlito and my favorite one played by Viggo Mortensen as the wheelchairbound Lalin an old associate of Carlito's.But in the end this film is ALL Mr. Pacino's who effortlessly essays the title character and gets some of the most quotable dialogue in the gangster genre of film. A top 10 film of the 1990s!".

	schema:reviewBody "A gangster in New York gets thirty years in prison. But his lawyer manages to have that reduced to five years. He is truly trying to remain clean and to make some rather honest money in a club though he gets the necessary investment from a bad deal that had cost the life of a few people. He was only an asset to a younger dealer a recommendation a referee if you want aired and exhibited by the younger one. But that younger one was dealing with young gangsters and of course they tricked him into dying losing his money and getting nothing except that Carlito puts things right to his own and sole benefit. But he has to deal with a vast Italian family in his club and outside. The main twist in the plot is that the lawyer who rescued him out of prison had been dealing with these gangsters and this family in particular even trapping one in prison after appropriating the million dollars this particular gangster had made in his business. But a lawyer will always be an amateur gangster and he drags Carlito into the last act of his own drama. That will cost their lives to the lawyer Carlito and half a dozen members of the family in the brilliant setting of Grand Central Station. At the very moment when he could have walked out of this life of outcast crime he is reminded that the leash that is attached around his neck will never disappear. This film has some depth somewhere about the great ease with which honest people can become dishonest and at times with the idea that they are not dishonest since the people they steal or rob are thieves themselves. The code of the street is all powerful and definitely stronger than any law imaginable. The film is brilliant too as an action film even this time with suspense and great actors Al Pacino being doubled up by Sean Penn. Brilliant rendering of the dilemma of a drug lord turned old and wouldbe honest.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Paris 12 Crteil CEGID".

	schema:headline " One of the best crime dramas of the 90's";
	schema:reviewBody "Brian De Palma and Martin Bregman the guys who were responsible for the gangster classic Scarface had scored another classic with Carlito's Way. Based on a novel by Edwin Torres the screenplay adaptation who incredibly was about to be turned down by Bregman is one of the best crime movies of the 90's or perhaps of all time.I was always curious about this movie and waited over 10 years to see it. I finally decided to just buy the DVD and let me tell you it was the best twelve bucks i've ever spent in my life. I was not disappointed one bit.Al Pacino gives an Oscarworthy performance as Carlito Brigante a Puerto Rican hustler from the 70's who has just served five years in prison and has vowed to live a clean life and stay away from crime but finds it very difficult to stay out of the streets and out of trouble once he gets back to the old neighborhood and meets up with his old acquaintances and little by little finds himself going back to the same life that put him behind bars in the first place. Sean Penn gives another Oscarworthy performance as Brigante's lawyer and friend David Kleinfeld who is very much involved in Brigante's world of crime in his own way and is way crazier and reckless than he looks. Penelope Ann Miller is great and very sexy as Pacino's love interest Gail. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent as well Luis Guzman as Carlito's right hand man Pachanga the thenunknown Viggo Mortensen in a short appearance as Carlito's acquaintance Lalin and of course one of the most memorable characters John Leguizamo as a drugdealer with high ambitions Benny Blanco from The Bronx. This movie is filled with great dialogue and even greater performances and is one of those movies that usually critics pound but that audiences love for generations. The movie's soundtrack is great as well the disco hits and the salsa music perfectly fit the mood of every scene and truly take you back to that time. This is by far one of Pacino's best movies in his career and he should've definitely at least been nominated for an Oscar. Definitely worth to be in your collection if you're a fan of crime dramas or gangster flicks. 10 out of 10.".

The big difference is that in Carlito's Way we aren't seeing a vain attempt to cash in on the success of a popular film series which really is all The Godfather III ever was.Al Pacino was on fine form in the title role but is probably outshone by Sean Penn as the cokeaddict lawyer David Kleinfeld who was almost certainly the inspiration for Ken Rosenberg in Grand Theft Auto Vice City which of course is directly connected by the involvement of Luis Guzman in both titles  as Pachanga in Carlito's Way and as the voice of Ricardo Diaz in GTA Vice City.Also it's good to see Viggo Mortensen in a role so vastly different to those he played in Lord of the Rings Hidalgo or even GI Jane. As an actor who usually plays such strong characters it is a refreshing change if you can regard it as such to see him in a wheelchair with a colostomy bag.All round well acted beautiful setting and some laughoutloud moments to boot.

	schema:reviewBody "'Carlito's Way' is another fantastic example of a film chronicling the rise 'and rise' and fall of a petty gangster. This time there's a bit of a twist in the initial narrative as the gangster antihero is attempting to 'rerise' the hierarchy albeit briefly for cash purposes upon being released form prison.I really and genuinely liked Carlito's Way. I thought it was funny well paced contained likabledislikeable characters to whom you could really get stuck into as a viewer and just generally held its own for two hours. What I really liked about the film was the use of miseenscene particularly the use of setting and lighting. It seemed that different shades and tones were used for different scenes and moods. The colour red was used to distinguish danger and warnings where as other lighter colours acted as relief. Examples can be when the colour red was used in the club scenes. Confrontation is always a possibility with eventual partypooper 'Benny from the Bronx' when the club is the setting and this continuous threat acted nicely with the lighting just as the red lighting in the strip club when Carlito sees his love interest working there it has a sort of 'shock factor' to it as he feels confrontation with his own emotions and probably a little bit of a heart broken feeling also.Whenever this red light crops up in the film Carlito is facing danger andor conflict with himself or others and it is threatening his American dream of moving to the Caribbean. Thus the lighting signals where and when he'll have is conflicts along his journey to a retirement of some sort.The feel the film has to it is also very realistic. When Carlito is involved in an early shoot out in a bar he is taking cover in the toilets and is genuinely concerned about the dangers that lie in the bar area waiting for him and although he doesn't realise he's already done the business he treats the situation like it's critical issuing threats buying time and trying to think up a plan of escape even though there's no need.Al Pacino really pushes home his character in this film. We see the two sides of Carlito at numerous well paced times and it's a real treat. The reformed kind hearted Carlito is blended in very well with the once violent ruthless professional Carlito that ultimately got him into prison in the first place. This reminds us that there are two sides to him and alters our opinion on him throughout. The violent distractions that frustratingly pop up for Carlito act as a mental subplot in the film and they really add to the character and to the experience of the film.This is well directed well thought out and well acted. The action scenes shootouts dialogue driven scenes and love interest scenes are all blended in very well and make for a superb gritty actioncrime drama.".

And what a ride it is.Al Pacino is simply astonishing as Carlito Brigante a reformed criminal who wants nothing more than to leave his old life behind and start anew.

Unlike Scarface Carlito's Way had much more of a smooth flow that tells a story without too much violence in it and what Carlito was trying to do to get away from his past. Every minute of the film is gold. The performances are the key in this movie and every performer is great with their role. To me the one that stood out the most was Sean Penn's '21 Grams' character because it showed just how his character could change in a matter of time. He was the most convincing character in the movie. This film also gave John Leguizamo 'Ice Age 1  2' better recognition as an actor. Overall this is a classic film of the crime genre and should not be overlooked.  1010".

Yes in the 'fractured fairy tale' department it's a far cry from the genius of Princess Bride or Shrek but it's an entertaining enough 90 minutes.  The effects are decent they can't all be Lord of the Rings perfect and I found myself laughing frequently.  I'm certainly glad I was completely unaware that this was based on a book as most of the negative comments here seem to be from people who complain about changes.  I can say that not knowing the original this story flowed just fine.  Certainly if one were to overanalyze the plot one could come up with innumerable ideas based on the idea 'if she must always obey why doesn't this happen?' but that's not really the point here is it?  it's a fairy tale for young girls.  My partner's 18 year old little sister who made me watch this as I never would have on my own loved it and I had to admit that I liked it enough to give it a thumbs up 7 out of 10 rating.".

In any case I haven't read that book and was blissfully unaware that this film was supposedly adapted from one. I found it surprisingly cute. Many of the campy things hit the mark like the medeival modern anachronistic setting reminiscent of The Flintstones cartoon wherein it was filled with modern things constructed from prehistoric materials and the modern songs transposed to the time setting herein. That last was a bit like Moulin Rouge which annoyed me at first but then grew on me. I don't believe that I've seen this Anne Hathaway before but she is intriguing. Her vivacity and wide smile remind me a bit of Julia Roberts. Can't say that I was much impressed with Hugh Dancy or Aiden McArdle. Minnie Driver was most charming as the incompetent fairy and Vivica Fox was quite amusing as the lush fairy. It's too bad that Parminder Nagra's part was so small as she always lights up a screen. And Cary Elwes couldn't hide his amusement with the material as he munched on the scenery. I say check this out if you aren't going to throw a fit over the book.".

That is not to say that the two leadsAnne Hathaway and Hugh Dancy are not bright and funny in their parts they are. Only that the wonderful and memorable lines come mainly from the more evil characters.Joanna Lumley as the evil Dame Olga and Minnie Driverone of her best yet possibly only beaten by her surprisingly good turn in Phantom of the Opera are also great in their minor roles providing colorful characters and not just filling in screen time. Aidan McArdleSlannen the Elf is wonderful comic relief each and every time he appears as is Lucy Punch as the horrid StepSister and chief fangirlshudder. Eric Idle Jeniffer Higham Jimi Mistry and Parminder Nagra are also memorable particularly Jimi as Benny Eric as the Narrator and Parminder as Ella's best friend though I think Parminder's talents are woefully under recognized in this film and I would love to see her in more main roles like in Bend it like Beckham.But I digress.Hopefully those watching this movie will remember the fun it is supposed to be and not fall into the trap of over analyzing this piece of lighthearted happiness.".

It was clever entertaining and impressively original for having been based on the ageold story of Cinderella.The movie is a lot better if you've never read the book.There are a ton of discrepancies between book and film. Now I realize that whenever you translate a book to the big screen some things are going to change or be lost or be added. I also realize that not all film adaptations can be Lord of the Rings. But for some reason the makers of THIS film didn't seem to feel that Ella's original predicament  receiving the gift of obedience as a baby which forced her to do anything anyone told her to do  was enough for a movie. They swapped out Prince Charmont's very nice parents for an evil regent who tries to force Ella to clear his path to the crown and added a few moderately amusing but altogether bizarre songand dance routines. Most of those scenes had me outright cringing. They also took away Ella's position as the protagonistnarrator and inserted an additional character to tell her story.That's not to say the movie is entirely without merit. The casting is excellent Cary Elwes is a delicious villain Eric Idle is a delight as the narrator and Anne Hathaway sparkles as Ella. And I was pleased to see that the film does remain true to the source material's underlying message  that in spite of whatever happens in your life you have the power to make your own happy ending.All in all it's a good film for the kids.

He also made up new characters and changed the old characters to fit his new plotChar's parents are dead and there's a new evil uncle Elwes with a cheesy snake servant who is trying to kill Char and take over the crownthere's also a new elf friend of Ella's who wants to be a lawyer can you say Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer? but is forced to only sing and dance by this new evil and tyrannical uncle created by O'Haverogres are also now not evil but only misunderstood! And Ella's father is nice and caring Mandy is no longer her caring sensible fairy godmother but a ditz and a magical klutz and the wonderful oldfashioned world created by Levine has been warped and cheapened by the director so that it's a faux modern world the modern costumes add to the cheap and fake look of the film. Overall the movie bears little resemblance to the book in anything but the title and character names and is the worst adaptation I have ever seen as well as a silly and stupid movie in itself. Hathaway does indeed reprise her role in Princess Diaries another terrible adaptation with changed character names setting roles etc though not as bad as this oneto the extent that there's even a debate scene that mirrors the one in Princess almost exactly forget finishing schoolthey have modern school in the movie!.In short don't waste your money on this filmuse the money instead to read Ella Enchantedbelieve me you'll get much better and higher quality entertainment this way for a lesser cost!".

One only wishes it had translated to screen better.Levine comes up with a clever explanation for the reason why Ella played in the film by Anne Hathaway must slave for her horrid stepfamily at her cradle a wellmeaning but rather dim fairy godmother Vivica A. Fox granted her the gift of obedience forcing the poor girl to comply with any direct order regardless of how ridiculous or dangerous. Refusing to be resigned to her lot Ella sets out to return the unwanted giftand en route find romance with Prince Charmont Char for short played by Hugh Dancy.Unfortunately it is here that the similarities to the source material end. In the film Ella comes off as far less resourceful and clever as she does in the book and mostly seems to wind up getting into embarrassing or awkward situations through her enforced compliance. Which is a shame because Hathaway is a vibrant and talented actress who could have easily imbued the character with more spunk had she been called on to do so. It doesn't help that the screenwriters have seen fit to muddy Ella's quest with a standardissue villain in the form of Char's Claudiusesquire uncle Cary Elwes channeling the spirit of Prince Humperdink and accompanied by a very unconvincing CGI snake and some business about the oppression of the kingdom's nonhumans.Like Shrek Ella Enchanted takes the fractured fairytale route throwing in sly references and anachronisms at every opportunity. Some of these work I liked the manpowered escalator in the medieval mall but more than a few fall flat mostly Char's squealing fan club who are perhaps too accurate in their annoying behavior. Hathaway and Dancy play it more or less straight but everyone else camps it up grandly especially Elwes. Unfortunately both Fox and Minnie Driver as Ella's more sensible godmother feel miscast and Parminder Nagra the talented star of Bend it Like Beckham is virtually wasted as Ella's foreignborn friend.Ella Enchanted is nice enough to sit throughHathaway's presence keeps things going and there are enough nice visuals.

The Elf another familiar face Dudley Moore in 'Not Only But Always' is wonderful as the sidekick. I also thought the story was very good it was slightly predictable at first but then there were some interesting twists where I think the usual fairytale storyline was changed to great effect. The way the Fairytale land echoed aspects of home were amusing with wooden escalators taxi carriages In a way I liked it more than Shrek because of the fact that it was less 'polished' and maybe more British. I would definitely recommend 'Ella Enchanted' to anyone who wants a fun and entertaining film.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've ever read Ella Enchanted you will be shocked that a movie studio couldso thoroughly ruin an excellent story. At it's heart Ella Enchantedthe book is a story of love frustration and other human emotions.Although you may find yourself smiling at times it is more of a romanticangsty fairytale than a comedic fairytale complete with one graying fairy godmother two banistersliding protagonists and three masque balls excluding Sir Peter's and Dame Olga's wedding reception. What Ella Enchanted does NOT contain is an evil talking snake. When Ella finally is able to find the strength to save not only herself but Char and the entire kingdom you are so happy for her that chances are you cry. As a matter of fact I would say I cried more than I laughed reading this book.Watching the movie I was speechless. It was extremely tacky and went for cheap easy laughs. At best I can call it a poor imitation of Shrek except that would be an insult to the highly entertaining Shrek. There is no place in Ella Enchanted for an evil royal uncle and his talking serpent and definitely no place for a singing Ella or a dancing cast. Nor a screaming fan club!. The welldeveloped character of Areida which I'm sure Parminder Nagra could have played well was cut down to a mere cameo.This movie lacked human emotion. Ella was not nearly as frustrated as any normal person would be at her curse. Hello? She breaks out in song and dance! Don't get me started on the range of emotions Areida could have covered. And of course Hattie is way too obnoxious and not nearly as manipulative read not obviously annoying but cruel as she could have been. If it were one actor's performance I would call it poor acting. In this case I would have to lay my blame almost entirely on the director and screenwriters. With such promising material they managed to create an hour and a half of rubbish.Even the movie's visuals gave it a much more modern feel with colors too vibrant for any over the age of 4. Half the time I felt like I was watching the Teletubbies. I would say the maximum age that these cheap laughs could amuse is 8 years old.I read the book when I was probably around 10 or so and have read it innumerable times since then. It truly appeals to all ages because unlike its movie version it deals with true emotions not cheap humor and anachronisms which honestly do not add to the story.In short forget the movie read the book!".

Anne Hathaway stole the show  there seemed to possess an invisible halo on her making her the most preferable Ella. However I did ruminate over the fact that is that all Anne Hathaway can play this character had almost cloning gestures as her character of Mia in The Princess Diaires  so is that how much her talent can expand? Well as for the other cast member  There was a casting perfection as taking into consideration Cary Elwes Minnie Driver and Vivica Fox all were matched perfectly to their designated roles. In conclusion I would not suggest this movie to grown ups as they would certainly NOT enjoy this step out of reality  however this would be a great movie for kids and may be pre teenagers and if you are an Anne Hathaway fan like me  well than don't miss this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ella Enchanted is a charming film that's good for the whole family. In this storybook fairy tale gone wrong Anne Hathaway plays Ella a girl given the magical gift of obedience by her fairy godmother at birth which turns into a curse because she can't refuse any command even from those who abuse this fact. To try to regain control of her life Ella goes on a quest to get the gift removed meeting ogres and giants and a dreamy prince Hugh Dancy along the way. The plot sounds stupid but the movie is a lot better then I expected it to be. Its hard to take the film serious at some points though and sometimes its not exactly clear what the plot is. I have never read the book so I can't compare but my friend said that they change a lot of things. The cast for the most part is pretty good with the best being Anne Hathaway but she needs to start picking different roles to avoid being a typecast. I thought the acting from Hugh Dancy was horrible and it would have been better if they would have gone with someone else. Vivica A. Fox Cary Elwes and Minnie Driver all have small roles and all do good job. The film is of course cheesy at some parts and all the gimmickry can become annoying after awhile. The film is pretty predictable but that shouldn't turn you away .The film is only 96 minutes long so it isn't a real punishment to watch the film. There are some things about the movie that didn't make sense and there are also a lot of pointless characters that could have been used without. In the end I think kids will really like Ella Enchanted Rating 710 if you have never read the book then you have a better chance of enjoying it. However if you have read the book then you will probably hate it like my friend did because they change a lot.".

But Ella Enchanted was my favorite childhood book and this movie completely butchered it.As a stand alone movie it's a mediocre predictable Shrek ripoff. But as a book adaptation it's a travesty. The only similarities between the book and this movie are the characters' names. The plot has been twisted into an unrecognizable mess with the name Ella Enchanted slapped onto it. Whereas the book was truly funny heartbreaking imaginative and magical the movie relies on cheap tacky slapstick humor and sentimentality. Why why WHY did they discard the wonderful ideas in the book sliding down stair rails the Cinderella parallels and add inane ideas instead like the evil uncle and annoying singing and dancing routines? There have been some truly good faithful to the book adaptations the BBC's Pride and Prejudice is one example. This doesn't come close. Please don't bother watching this movie. Read the Newbery Honor Award winning book instead. It's actually worth your time.".

	schema:headline " rare moments of joy don't save this weak story from feeling distinctively amateur";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Fairy tales help us feel good about life. Often changed beyond belief from their original style just look at Disney's alterations to multiple different classics they make you smile and forget the real world for a while. It's particularly inappropriate then for Eric Idle's narrator to literally tell you to get back to reality. Telling the story of 'Ella Enchanted' Idle is just one of many flaws with this predictable and vomit inducing film. Possessing few moments of true pleasure the story is average and feels incredibly amateur. Badly shot often badly acted a shock considering some of the names on the cast sheet and always awkward you do wonder why you finish with a smile on your face.As a baby Ella Anne Hathaway is given a particularly awful present by a self absorbed fairy Vivica A Fox. Unable to turn down a request Ella finds that everything in her life revolves around doing the commands of others. Increasingly frustrated by two awful step sisters Lucy Punch and Jennifer Higham and their demands Ella decides to put an end to this once and for all. Setting off to find the fairy Ella's adventures are just beginning.This is the first time that this particular viewer has seen Anne Hathaway perform on screen having avoided 'The Princess Diaries' and it's not difficult to see why many like her. The perfect Hollywood starlet with a wide smile and an almost constant air of 'cute' Hathaway is yet another of these up and coming beautiful women. It's a shame therefore that she's also an awful actress. Doing the typical blowing the hair in a 'oh no' sort of way every time she is ordered to do something Hathaway's style is hardly the most diverse. At the same time though she's hardly given a helping hand by her supporting cast and a dreadful story.To possess a cast including Eric Idle Jimi Mistry Jim Carter Cary Elwes and Joanna Lumley you'd expect some better performances. Whilst Carter and Lumley are blatantly out for a laugh and seem to enjoy themselves others including Elwes and Idle are truly dreadful. Singing everything in rhyme Idle really should view this as a mistake to remove from his c.v. He strolls around in different outfits and he never looks comfortable. It's almost like the poor man is using the film as a vehicle to show himself to a younger audience. Bad choice there Eric you're doing yourself no favours with this film.Predictable from the outset a sick bucket is a useful companion if you want to watch this. The worst part about this is that these moments often occur just when you've witnessed a rare funny moment or a decent satire of society. For example one minute you get Hathaway telling Hugh Dancy's Prince Char obviously changed to make him look more hip and to avoid any references to the current British monarchy that he has a responsibility to do particular actions for the good of his kingdom and then the next you find her singing and dancing for what feels like an eternity. It's just so dumb and pointless.Without trying to really destroy the whole fairy tale aspect of the story let's just point out that you just know that there will be a porn equivalent out of this film within a short space of time. Here's a cute girl who does whatever she's told and yet with the exception of one moment when Cary Elwes tells her to touch her toes and he stands behind her grinning you never sense any sort of sexuality about it. There would be teenage boys pointing this out and making countless rude comments although lets be honest most are probably out having a better time than watching this garbage.Another problem and the final real criticism promise of this film is that more often than not it feels like it has actually been filmed and put together by a bunch of toddlers. Obscure camera zoom modes feeling stolen from an Alanis Morrisette video weird use of colours woeful soundtrack the entire film just feels incredibly amateur in design and completion. This is one of Tommy O'Haver's few films and truefully it feels like it. The man has screwed up major with this shambles and the sooner Hollywood stops offering him work the better.It's perhaps fitting to make a nod at the films aims and the horrifying fact that on one front they succeeded with honours. This for all intense purposes is an awful awful creation. Rarely entertaining vomit inducing and badly made it really should feature on any persons 'most hated' list. That is except that for whatever evil reason you DO find yourself smiling at the end. You know you shouldn't and by all the laws of the universe it should be an impossibility so how does this happen? It's tough to explain really. Perhaps deep down we all just like to see mindless dross with a happy ending. From an analytical point of view as viewers you should finish the film wanting to put all those who made it on trial for crimes against humanity so please stop smiling.'Ella Enchanted' is a dire waste of time. Badly acted badly written badly films vomit inducing and mindless drivel the film has very little going for it. For some reason though and against all natural law you can't help but smiling after it. You probably should be locked in a mental institution for that fact but sadly the doctors were smiling too.".

It was just very well done and the rest did not feel rushed at all. If only it had been about 10 minutes longer at the start to get us to really feel that too instead of brushing aside the seriousness of it as if it were a slapstick laughjob it would've scored another star or two.Definitely go see it if you liked 500 Days Of Summer.

Catherine Zeta Jones looks lovely throughout. I literally fell in love with her after watching the movie.

She portrays the role presented to her with perfection and looks plausible as a single mother raising two kids. Moreover No matter what others say I feel the chemistry between her and Justin Bartha The Hangover Groom if not tremendously magical was just right for the movie. The movie is never uninteresting and did keep me glued to the screen. It makes you smile in places with some witty and amusing scenes and also imparts some wisdom about life and any relationship.

I am certain that with this film you will see more relationships with older womenyounger men out in the open. Best part of the film was when Aram  Sandy were going at it on the couch while her kids were asleep. They are caught in the act when Frank Jr. comes out and asks Did you just pee on my mom? I think our entire theatre died of laughter. Oh the trials of dating when you have kids!".

Justin Bartha is also the main reason makes this story believable. one of the great example of how right casts can push a B level of the production script and its director to even possibly work. there are some good moments but most of the time one just so much hope the director can go deeper and build on characters in a much more personal angles sadly he did't. without these two main actors the movie would be a 45 out of 10 piece of work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sandy Catherine ZetaJones is a very organized type A mother who adores her two kids. However she catches her husband in an act of infidelity on a webcam and decides to change her life in a major way. Instead of the suburbs she moves her family into an apartment above a Manhattan coffee shop  starts a job search. Meanwhile gettingadivorce Aram Justin Bartha is a barista at the cafe despite having a college degree which displeases his extremely pushy parents Art Garfunkel and Joanna Gleason. On their advice Aram tries a part time stint at a woman's issues agency where he has to dress up in a protected suit and let the women vent their angers on him! One of them happens to be our Sandy naturally. All too soon these two meet again when she returns to her department. Needing a babysitter one day she asks Aram to help her out. The two children a boy and a girl adore him so before long Aram is installed as the nanny. Also despite the decade of age difference between S and A they have eyes for each other. Something may be approaching in terms of a relationship but how can it survive when it is more of a rebound coupling? This is a nice flick written and directed by a respected indie filmmaker Bart Freundlich. He himself is married to Julianna Moore who is a few years older than her husband. Therefore he has good insight into a MaySeptember relationship. ZetaJones and Bartha who seem an odd couple at first evaluation give nice performances as the afflicted twosome while all other cast members do a nice job too. Sets costumes and photography are likewise quite attractive. The resolution is admirable as it strikes a balance between a ride into the sunset and an unhappy finish. The only minor criticism is that there is some salty dialogue and scenarios that won't please the Grated crowd so stay away from it if this applies to you. That said most romcom fans will like it just fine.".

	schema:headline " A great romantic comedy!";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie on a whim and was extremely impressed. It quickly became a new favorite of mine. I have seen several reviews that are giving this movie completely unfair reviews. I mean seriously you're going to grade a comedy based on the camera work? A comedy has one job  To make you laugh. With that said this movie will do that a lot. I also see a lot of people giving this a lower review because of a slow start but I don't see it. If you really can't handle a movie taking ten minutes to introduce the characters and set up the story then just go watch stupid videos on youtube and leave the movie community alone. The final gripe I see is that the characters are unlikable which I also don't see. The characters in this movie are great depictions of two people who have just been through a bad breakup. Aram is a very likable young man who is slightly adrift in life because he is recently divorced and has a lot of trouble relating to people his age most likely because the one friend he does seem to have commits 90 of his dialogue to sex for example at one point Aram asks Do you ever think about kids? and he replies I think about making them all the time and proceeds to hump a nearby counter. Sandy is also slightly adrift because of a recent breakup with her husband of several years so she now finds herself single forced to move and find a job all pretty much immediately. The two meet when Sandy moves into an apartment above a coffee shop where Aram works and he is eventually talked into babysitting for the family as well. Romance ensues if you couldn't guess. Overall the story is pretty solid. So all that there is left to discuss is the comedy so here is what i will say If you think it is funny to see people in those giant sumo suits getting the crap kicked out of them or someone being so bad at bowling they can't hit a single pin or someone using a portapotty in the middle of a date and still talking to the girl amidst several farts then you will like it. Don't worry that's not all the funny stuff in the movie The final thing I wanted to talk about was the ending so SPOILERS! Yes of course they breakup the point of this movie is that this is a rebound. What that relationship did for both of them was get them out of their rut it really saved both of their lives. Sandy got a career of the ground and Aram finally took some time to figure his life out and basically got his crap together. Once the two of them got everything else taken care of then they could get together but before then it wouldn't have worked. The movie is much more realistic than most and I applaud it for that.".

Zeta Jones sort of stands out of the heap for she is really cute. But that's really all there is to her. No good and believable acting on her part either. Justin Bartha is just annoyingly goofy. Every time he stood around grinning that shallow grin of his I just wanted to hit him in the face. Hard. And the Kids are the most annoying thing I've seen in years. Why is it that Hollywood just doesn't seem to be able to show children as they are. Why do they always have to be so violently cute and smart? It's just implausible. And those two here are the blandest and shallowest smartasses I've seen since Home Alone. Should I say something about the plot? No... I bet you already got how it works. No surprises here. It just reminded me of prime with Uma Thurman. At the end I got the impression they just wrote one or two pages of script to it. What else? It has no music to speak of the camera work is average but nothing special. It's just a really bad movie. And it is not like I don't have a soft spot for good romantic movies.

	schema:reviewBody "The ReboundAfter she found out that her husband cheated a housewife and a dedicated mother Sandy Catherine ZetaJones decided to move to New York City for a fresh start and met a young man Aram Finklestein Justin Bartha a college graduate who works in a coffee shop right below her apartment. Having a new job for Sandy in SNN means lesser time for her kids so she hired this young man Aram to babysit her kids. In order to move on and to get a life she opens herself in meeting different men set up by her friend but just led her to disappointment. She spent her spare time with her kids and the babysitter Aram and got to know him well and noticed that Aram were funny kind and a lot more adult than the other men she met.I really like the chemistry of Catherine ZetaJones and Justin Bartha. They're so romantic especially how ARAM compliments SANDY. I think most women love to be complimented by their no matter what. The children were cool and have extreme interrogation skills. The flow of the story was really good. Every scene was in perfect timing. I felt a little bored on their second date where they watched a stage play. Never mind it's just a blink of an eye. It didn't take that long. Ha haSandy's family made this young man realized on what he wants to do in life. On being a grown up man is about taking responsibilities in life. I thought ARAM's parents will hinder their relationship. My suspicion was wrong they broke up because they doubted that their relationship will not work because of the age gap. But it makes sense who would have thought that their broke up would make them a better person would lead them to fulfillment and satisfaction and finally reach happiness?This film presented a burnt out mother who gave up everything for her family her dreams and her social life to be able to be a full time house wife and a dedicated mother but what she gets in return her husband cheated on her.They also highlight the common lament of women when a woman got married become a housewife and a mother most likely forgotten their own ambition and dreams as individual. Historically husbands' or men in general do over powered women.

	onyx:emotionText "The ReboundAfter she found out that her husband cheated a housewife and a dedicated mother Sandy Catherine ZetaJones decided to move to New York City for a fresh start and met a young man Aram Finklestein Justin Bartha a college graduate who works in a coffee shop right below her apartment. Having a new job for Sandy in SNN means lesser time for her kids so she hired this young man Aram to babysit her kids. In order to move on and to get a life she opens herself in meeting different men set up by her friend but just led her to disappointment. She spent her spare time with her kids and the babysitter Aram and got to know him well and noticed that Aram were funny kind and a lot more adult than the other men she met.I really like the chemistry of Catherine ZetaJones and Justin Bartha. They're so romantic especially how ARAM compliments SANDY. I think most women love to be complimented by their no matter what. The children were cool and have extreme interrogation skills. The flow of the story was really good. Every scene was in perfect timing. I felt a little bored on their second date where they watched a stage play. Never mind it's just a blink of an eye. It didn't take that long. Ha haSandy's family made this young man realized on what he wants to do in life. On being a grown up man is about taking responsibilities in life. I thought ARAM's parents will hinder their relationship. My suspicion was wrong they broke up because they doubted that their relationship will not work because of the age gap. But it makes sense who would have thought that their broke up would make them a better person would lead them to fulfillment and satisfaction and finally reach happiness?This film presented a burnt out mother who gave up everything for her family her dreams and her social life to be able to be a full time house wife and a dedicated mother but what she gets in return her husband cheated on her.They also highlight the common lament of women when a woman got married become a housewife and a mother most likely forgotten their own ambition and dreams as individual. Historically husbands' or men in general do over powered women. Many of them wants their woman to took over the household so the woman becomes so dedicated to that role which results to regretting for the things she wants to do but wasn't able to do so.I really adore this movie and I especially love the ending. Aram finally steps up and fixes his career. He traveled to different countries and does what he has to do for the sense of purpose in life. While Sandy chased her dreams became a better mom and finally she found herself again.This film is definitely worth watching for.

Aram is a complete unmotivated wimp to whom Sandy a Stanford grad and motivated career woman would not be attracted. The dialogue from the two kids and especially in front of the two kids is WAY too mature. If she is such a great mom how come her kids are so smart mouthed impudent and rude to adults. The first time is cute. The fifth through the 100th time they overact with smart mouths is terrible. There was NO chemistry between Sandy and Aram so I just couldn't buy the relationship. Even Sandy's friend was annoying with her constant talk about getting Sandy laid. The shot selection in one scene where Aram is pouring a drink  portrait and 90 degrees clockwise from normal was really banal. Why shoot it that way and worse why leave it in when editing. The net of all this is whomever wrote and directed this film has not lived in the normal world the characters don't behave as real people would and if a good comedy is based in reality then this comedy was destined to be pathetic.".

It could very well be a greater drama than it is as a comedy. It relies on slapstick jokes and adult children humor which is not applicable to watch at certain times. Overall the movie is about growth I would like it more if they expand the last 15 min to an hour and lose some of the early stuff that doesn't matter as much. Thanks for the ending.".

I'm even a fan of smut and toilet humour if it's wellexecuted and genredefined. But for such wildly inappropriate muck to masquerade as a romantic comedy is just terrible.The idiot producers of The Rebound clearly thought it would be OK to have the kids in the film spout pure filth all the time. Even when they're not spewing profanities or casually conversing with adults about sex they're standing around while everyone else does. That's just wrong. It's not funny in fact it's pretty creepy.And there seems to be a gratuitous overabundance of this kind of stuff. The family in The Rebound CZJ and her horrible children  seem to be very unlucky when it comes to vagabonds exposing themselves to the kids on the streets of New York in fact it happens twice in the film. Why is this? What made the producers think this is funny? There is no character development in The Rebound in fact there are no actual characters just people that stuff happens to. The dialogue is stilted and vacuous and irritating and the plot is so wildly unbelievable that it's barely worth mentioning. What sort of mother lets the guy from the coffee shop  whom she's just met  babysit her kids? What topped the madness off for me was the film's insane ending where the main character Aram Finkelstein  on his trip round the world after vainly attempting to court Catherine Zeta Jones and her kids  passes a young Bangladeshi boy on the steps of some religious temple and they exchange a furtive coy little glance. I thought 'Surely this guy isn't about to start wooing the kid? Surely not?' But sure as hell after Aram's soulsearching period he returns home to introduce the kid as his new son gushing We met in Bangladesh and just fell in love with each other. Seriously  I kid you not.You fell in love with a little boy? And then what you just decided he was your son? What made the people behind The Rebound think this is acceptable or believable? But do the producers even care that The Rebound makes no sense? Do they care that it's so artless and stupid and lacking in any redeeming qualities? I'm actually beginning to think this film is just some kind of cultish indoctrination piece with an ulterior motive. That's the only explanation I can think of for such a smutty and morally indigent piece of trash.I'd encourage people to see this film if only for the opportunity to witness Hollywood at its absolute lowest ebb.

	schema:reviewBody "The Rebound was a very enjoyable and funny movie. The summary and poster suggested a slightly more erotic story than it actually is. It's more like a decent above average and funny romantic comedy. Especially the children in the story and their expressions are hilarious. It's a very credible story about sexual tension and growing respect and love between two people from different age categories something we see all around us in real life. It addresses issues like reactions from family and friends especially in a less common situation of an older woman dating a younger guy as this is often harshly judged by outsiders.So it's only logical Sandy's emotional response to this relationship is slightly over the top sometimes. Aram is clearly an adult. He's very mature for his age is very good with her kids very romantic and assertive enough to deal with all mockery. Aside from the shallow and often plain jealous reactions of others there's no reason whatsoever for her to stop this relationship. Still the pressure of judgment becomes too much for her and she breaks up with him. Possibly she also wants to make sure his love is not just an impulsive lustful crush that keeps him from fulfilling his youthful ambitions. Her irrational inhibitions towards this relationship remain until Aram has reached the age of thirty has found a place and job of his own and has an adopted son. This is where the story ends with a whole range of possibilities.I thought this story was welltold credible and funny. I shows how people easily judge what they know nothing about like a 25yearold dating an older woman. A lot of people give credence to the idea that maturity and age go handinhand while there are numerous examples of people in their forties who keep acting like they're in puberty and adults who read Harry Potter who actually have a better sense of reality than those who don't. This movie gives a more complex take on relationships and concepts like maturity trust and responsibility that leaves the solution or conclusion to the audience.".

I even bet myself that I wouldn't make it through the first half hour. Well I was wrong. It certainly isn't a ground breaking film or anything that will win a film festival but let's be honest I just wanted an hour and a half of entertainment. I've always liked Catherine Zeta Joneswhich means I think she's hot so I figured it would be worth watching her. But it turned out that I also liked the characters too. NOT liking the characters is usually what prompts me to turn a movie off. Bad characters are most often a result of bad writing a problem that this movie doesn't have. I was surprised several times with well written moments. I kind of hoped for a different ending but then I almost ALWAYS hope for a different ending. Hollywood only seems to have one ending though and if I want to see the ending I REALLY want the movie most likely has to be shot in 16mm. Anyway if you like this kind of movie then this is a movie you will like. I have this theory about romanticcomedy movies that one of the two main characters tends to be unlikable or at least LESS likable. For exampleYou've Got Mail AND Sleepless In Seattleto me Meg Ryan's characters are both fairly irritating. Notting HillI didn't really care for Julia Robert's character at any point in the movie. Here though I really like both of these characters and relate to them both in a positive way. I say it's worth your time. Don't let the bad Hollywood name scare you away.

And Aram Justin Bartha is fantastic in his role as a mature 25 year old who falls for his 40 year old newly separated 'boss' as he works as a nanny to her children.Worth a watch. The plot line is far less predictable than most of the cookie cutter films with which it shares its genre. Those who like their fairy tale happy endings might be disappointed.

It's the inner struggle of a man whose pacifist Christian beliefs came into conflict with his patriotism. It's the heart and soul of this film beautifully crafted by director Howard Hawks.The real Sergeant York eschewed all money making ventures that would have capitalized on his heroics in World War I and had resisted giving the rights to his story to Hollywood. He relented because in 1941 he became concerned with the danger fascism posed for the world and advocated preparedness. Part of what brought him out was the speechmaking of that other American hero Charles A. Lindbergh who was an appeasement advocate. York even called the shots on who was to play him. So Jack Warner made a call to Adolph Zukor over at Paramount and probably paid one hefty sum for Gary Cooper's services. It was worth every penny of it as Cooper got his first Oscar for Best Actor.Alvin York is a poor farmer supporting a widowed mother and a brother and sister. And he likes to cut loose every so often with a jug and a rifle. But he gets converted and gets involved in Walter Brennan's church which is a strict fundamentalist sort with pacifist tenets. When America gets into World War I his very soul is tormented by the tenets of his church and the volunteer tradition of his state. Tennessee is known as the Volunteer State and that nickname is no lie. It bothers him more than other men because as Pastor Walter Brennan tells him he's got the using kind of religion.These people may be fundamentalists and somewhat backward but they're not phonies. No high hog living preachers here just simple people trying to get through life the best they can. Howard Hawks did a masterful job in casting this film with some actors very used to playing rustics. Ward Bond Noah Beery Jr. Howard DaSilva Clem Bevans and most of all Walter Brennan as Pastor Rosier Pyle tripling as preacher postmaster and owner of the general store. Brennan got an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor but since he'd already won three of them the Academy voters gave Donald Crisp a break that year for How Green Was My Valley.The York family is played by Margaret Wycherly June Lockhart and Dickie Moore as mother brother and sister. Wycherly is one you'll remember also. Hard to believe this is the same woman who is also James Cagney's Ma in White Heat. Come to think of it maybe not Ma York and Ma Jarrett are both tough survivors.As for the action that won him decorations from all the Allied powers including the Congressional Medal of Honor you'll just have to see the film for that. But while some liberties are taken with York's prewar story what happened in the Argonne is actually what happened.We could use a whole lot more Sergeant Yorks those with the using kind of religion.".

Few people in his era were better at playing modest softspokenbutmanly heroes like Coop. When York makes no apology for his 100 percent belief in the Bible no one challenges him because he's earned the respect from all believers and non believers. Cooper's status as an actor helps make that all the more believable. Sgt. York also gives one of the best examples of forgiveness I've ever seen on film.Another nice feature of this movie is seeing Joan Leslie in the female lead. She was one of the most pretty and wholesomelooking ladies of her day. She's always a treat to see. Walter Brennan also is interesting as usual and in here plays a minister which also was a surprise.Much of this film was a surprise because I'm just not used to seeing on film things like true forgiveness the hero citing Scripture military officers shown in a compassionate light letting York with his pacifistic views decide what he anted to do etc. What a shame so few films in the last 50 years have had similar values.".

Then there is Ward Bond in one of his many films Over 250 of them I believe. Now a little for the trivia books. Cooper was 41 when he made this film and Leslie was only 16 but this is fairly consistent with the true ages of York and Gracie when they were beginning their relationship. So the film tries to be very accurate and honest. You won't find that in a modern film.If you have not seen Sergeant York then you have yet to see one of the most touching films of all time. It is as much an attention holder today as it was back in 1941 and makes an excellent Memorial Day film which is in fact the best time to try and catch it if you happen to have cable and some of those classic film channels.".

The lightningbolt incident didn't happen either. But these are minor complaints as the movie stays true to the key events of York's amazing story.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you hear it said that truth is sometimes stranger than fiction it's the story of Sergeant York that might have been the inspiration. I'd been on the lookout for this film for some time when it appeared today on Turner Classic Movies as part of a Veteran's Day tribute. I tried to picture the real life hero Alvin York on the battlefield amid enemy fire pulling off the ruse that led to the capture of one hundred thirty two enemy soldiers and all because a superior officer ordered him to take charge. Perhaps he should have been ordered to win the war.I would like to have seen the real Alvin York he must have been quite the extraordinary person. Not in a celebrity fashion but in a deep spiritual sense to have integrated his pacifist background with a sense of loyalty and brotherhood with his fellow soldiers. I can think of no other man you would want more in your corner when the chips are down and it's a matter of life or death.Gary Cooper's Best Actor Oscar was well deserved for his portrayal of Sergeant York. He's convincing throughout as he transforms York from a rabble rousing back woods country hick to a principled man of values and ideals. The scenes where he records his meager earnings in hopes of buying some fertile downland is nearly heartbreaking made even more poignant when he later makes amends with the men who essentially betrayed him.Cooper is backed up with a fine supporting cast but I have to admit I wound up chuckling a time or two when Walter Brennan's pastor character appeared. For some reason those bushy black eyebrows called to mind an image of Groucho Marx that I just couldn't shake. Margaret Wycherly brings a matriarch's knowing instincts to the part of Mother York somehow knowing that her son would eventually get his own patch of land someday even when her own husband's experience seemed to suggest otherwise.It was somewhat surprising yet gratifying at the same time to learn that the real Alvin York shunned all attempts to cash in on his name and hero status in order to get back to his home and family responsibilities. When he finally relented to numerous requests to make a film of his war time achievements he had only two conditions  that all of the proceeds go to religious charities and that the actor to portray him would be Gary Cooper. I'd say he cut a square deal.".

If we compare the bad war films with the good ones we find only one difference but this difference is fundamental the matter of the actors. And Gary Cooper is a great actor. His personality guarantees the standard high quality all over the movie. He plays a farmer from Tennessee who wants to guarantee a comfortable life for himself and his love beautiful Joan Leslie but the United States declares war to Germany and he has to enlist to the army. The first half of the movie is full of eyepopping blackandwhite sceneries and great laughable characters and situations. I love the character of George York Alvin York's younger brother played by Dickie Gibson the most. That scene is so cool where he finds Alvin at the bar which is settled on the border of Tennessee and Kentucky and forces his brother to go home. He has a big gun in his hands for safety sake. These people are simple farmers they live in peace and harmony don't care much about the rest of the world they don't even heard about the World War they live by the rules of the Bible.There is a great battle scene at the second half of the movie. Alvin realizes that the war is similar to the turkey hunting kills lot of German soldiers and becomes a national hero and the most decorated American soldier of the WWI. This film is great because it's lack of unnecessary patriotism and heroism. It's about the duty we have to fulfill because there are situations in life when our personal happiness is less important than the freedom of others. Alvin C. York realizes this and goes to a war against a country which he has never heard of and protects people whom he has never met. That's why he is a great man. And when he fulfilled his duty he goes home to the wellearned peace and comfort. And when Gary Cooper fulfilled his duty and gave a superb performance as Alvin York he got the wellearned Academy Award for the Best Actor.".

I would like to correct that because in fact and according to the movie he was from the Cumberland Mountains of Tennessee.

It is for sure an under rated film by the American Film Institute. Why it was never placed in the top 100 I don't know. Or why Michael Medved never placed it in his top 10 list of greatest Christian films.On top of this it is a good family film with extremely high redeeming values. The war scenes toward the last half of the film have some mildly violent images compared to now days. I'm saying this because there are some families out there who may not want to subject there children to any violence what so ever not even on screen.".

The inaccuracies were mostly done for dramatic effect and don't really change the nature of the man or his deeds. Sure his conversion was a lot less spectacular and he was already married before he went off to war but the spirit of the film was correct. Leave it to Warner Brothers to get wonderful supporting character actors and a wonderful musical score and great cinematography to work together to make a perfect film for the time. Not surprisingly the film took home the Best Actor Oscar in 1942.I'd say more but frankly there are already a ton of reviews on this seminal film. I'd hate to be repetitive though just had to point out how much I love and respect the film having just seen it again for the second time.By the way get a load of Walter Brennan's eyebrows.

The moving and deep drama of the Ozark hillbilly working himself to death to obtain some 'bottom land' is heavy and compelling drama in itself so much so that one tends to wonder when the war will become an issue. But it does and again it fills the heart and mind with pathos and suspense. Sergeant York was released during WWII as an obvious warbond pusher and patriotism builder and it is no wonder that is was wildly successful. The war scenes and Cooper's acting are set into a realistic and colorful environment of battle and personal conflict. When York's You done gimme command line erupts from the speakers the viewer is on the edge of his seat already entranced by the personal heroism of this quiet man. What York did in the war capturing 132 Germans was real and the film's portrayal is right on the money even to the extent I believe of filming it on the actual site but I'm not willing to swear to it. It's the kind of film that makes one proud to be an American and that was its goal. Cooper is entirely believable although the real Alvin York was hardly as goodlooking. It's easy to fall in love with the everpretty Joan Leslie a gem of a woman as well as the simple and practical Margaret Wycherly as Ma York. Don't you get the idea that she and Pastor Pile have a thing going? Just an irreverent thought.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are movies that you can barely remember hours after watching them and there are movies you can't forget even years later. Sergeant York is the later. The movie remains etched in my mind and heart.It is a story clearly told yet not oversimplified with characters boldly drawn yet not caricatured at least not the main ones. It would be a great story even if it were not true but it is true at least in the main. York's conversion by a lightning bolt striking his rifle is fiction though his heavy drinking fighting and ultimate conversion are not. So the lightning is cinematic device to shorten the process and a brilliant one.Those who talk about it as a war story and who complain the first part is boring miss why this film is so great. It is also a love story and a story of family. Joan Leslie is heartbreakingly sweet and lovely as Gracie Williams. We can feel the chemistry and see that she is a force for good in Alvin's life who was 30 when he was drafted.Leslie's portrayal of Gracie is so full of life and youth and charm. Compare that with Margaret Wycherly's portrayal of Mother York who is old tired dessicated of emotion. Yet she is full of wisdom of understanding Alvin's passion for Gracie. In her eyes you can see her thinking back to when she was once Gracie in her long ago youth. It is a silent motionless look plumbing the depths of memory  a master actress's use of silence.I think most viewers take Wycherly's performance for granted perhaps assuming we are seeing the real Wycherly. Yet she was born in London in 1881 to a father who was a doctor  far from the poverty of Pall Mall Tennessee  and had been mainly a British stage and film actress. Nevertheless those who knew the real Mother York say Wycherly's portrayal was spot on. Now that is real acting.It is curious that this is the role that earned Gary Cooper his first Oscar. We the modern viewer have seen that Aw Shucks persona many times. But apparently it fit the real Alvin York who insisted on Cooper playing him on screen and was present for the movie's premiere. You can read about Alvin York online on Wikipedia and on Gutenberg.org which has a 1920s biography online. In the quotes of the actual Alvin York you can easily hear Gary Cooper's voice.Henry Fonda was considered for the role and matched York's looks more closely. But he was only a few years younger than Cooper so it wouldn't have helped much with the GracieYork match up. I think he could have done the role but Cooper's fit was right and almost magical. Modesty was the hallmark of York and Cooper had it down far more than Fonda. Frankly I don't notice the age thing when I watch it it's a movie and you need to be prepared to suspend disbelief up to a point. Besides people who work hard outside tend to look older especially if they don't have much to eat.The scene where the family sits down to dinner and Mother York proudly presents the bag of salt is so beautiful. She reminds me of a stray mother cat who will do anything to protect and feed her children even to the point of starvation or death herself. And when I buy salt I sometimes think about this and how lucky I am.As to the portrayal of hillbillies we must remember that this was an extremely rural mountain area with no road coming in  the real Alvin pushed the state to build one after the war  and it was nearly a century ago. People were different. There was little schooling too and the real Alvin later raised funds to build a school. While we see Alvin drinking and fighting we also see hard working intelligent gentle people with nice homes so I don't see any stereotyping here.As to the war yes the story is true. You can read about it yourself. And it provides a great lesson we should continue to remember today and in the future The only justification for killing people in war aside from self defense is to end the killing and end war. That is what was in York's mind and he says so to stop the killing. York was a pacifist at heart. Killing the enemy out of anger hatred retaliation or revenge was not in his mind and should not be in the mind of any soldier. When this happens it corrodes the soul of the soldier so that he can no longer feel like a normal human being.It was also probably what was on the minds of thousands of Americans who enlisted after seeing this movie which was released months before America actually entered the war following Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7 1941. By then the war had already been raging for two years and America's entry was consistent with York's hope of helping to bring the fighting to an end.York didn't lose his feeling for his fellow man. I found this item from the IMDb trivia section interesting Alvin York himself was on the set for a few days during filming. When one of the crew members tactlessly asked him how many Jerries he had killed York started sobbing so vehemently he threw up. The crew member was nearly fired but the next day York demanded that he keep his job.While the attack he lead killed 28 German soldiers he also captured 132 saving their lives.".

	schema:reviewBody "I started watching this with expectations of seeing a hero right at the start and a very human tarnished man appeared. That shouldn't be surprising since what is just so difficult to grasp is that this movie accurately portrays what happened that day in the Argonne. Wow. You have to ask how did a real man do all that? This is what the movie as a whole tries to answer and I think it succeeds pretty well in doing so.On an external level it was really fun to watch Gary Cooper Ward Bond and Noah Berry Jr.partying all over the place and there was Walter Brennan bringing old time religion to the Tennessee hills. I didn't recognize Brennan at first just his voice. The eyebrows were a bit much I agree.The story is an exceptionally deep one about a man's religious conversion and then testing. I'd like to see another movie today this time with the real story of his conversion although the version in this film is powerfully and well done.The major's comment after York returns from his 10day furlough really gets at the heart of the matter. The captain is concerned that York's ongoing struggles with conscience will make him a battle risk but the major understands that York has really proved that he is an ideal fighter  one who will work away at a challenge until he beats it.The battle sequences are done with as much authenticity as the sequences in Tennessee were. There really isn't much screen time for the setup scene in the trenches but Hawks wastes no chance to convey the hellish battlefield setting the soulnumbed and battleshocked human being that stares out at us from the British soldier's eyes and the nervousness and yet willingness of the new American troops as they wait in the trench for the signal to go over the top.This meant a lot to me since I recently found out that the local VFW post is named after a local man who was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions in the same general area where York and other Americans were operating a week or two earlier than York's action on October 8 and who was killed in action three weeks to the day after York's action and less than two weeks before the Armistice. His story moved me quite a bit I don't know much about WWI and appreciate learning a little more about it.In this movie Hawks also shows York's new status as hero and how he deals with it which is the same as he has handled all his other tests by thinking it over until he sees the right way to proceed. That was a good thing to include.There were a couple of weak spots  the major's telling York on the battlefield that York's desire to save lives was the most remarkable thing of all. Actually from all I've read that is what motivates generally all soldiers including those who eventually are given medals for their actions. I think the major would have known that and of course soon all America would relearn it.Also the last part where she surprises York is totally unbelievable since the field is right out there by the brook and he would have seen all that probably even before he crossed the bridge. Still even though it's hokey and you pretty much know what is going to happen it's enjoyable and it's a good place to end the movie.".

That shouldn't be surprising since what is just so difficult to grasp is that this movie accurately portrays what happened that day in the Argonne. Wow. You have to ask how did a real man do all that? This is what the movie as a whole tries to answer and I think it succeeds pretty well in doing so.On an external level it was really fun to watch Gary Cooper Ward Bond and Noah Berry Jr.partying all over the place and there was Walter Brennan bringing old time religion to the Tennessee hills. I didn't recognize Brennan at first just his voice. The eyebrows were a bit much I agree.The story is an exceptionally deep one about a man's religious conversion and then testing.

After more than 60 years this affecting wartime story of a child's escape by train desperately trying to protect one cherished keepsake is still powerfully vivid to me.

Andy Devine is plainly recognizable however. It seems that Tryon later became the producer of Hellzapoppin and Hold That Ghost. He also holds the only acting credit for a film that anyone at all seems to have seen Variety Girl from 1947.

There's even a great piece of foreshadowing in the film which I won't mention because it hints at the ending which I'll never understand why people spoil because it's the very Heart and Soul of the film. If there was ever a film whose ending should NEVER be spoiled it's Lonesome.And I'm especially lucky in thatever since I've seen this filmI've always wanted it to be restored and released on DVD and I don't know how it happened maybe because I've told so many people about it without spoiling it! maybe the Universe saw how much I loved this film...but it was finally restored and releasedget thison my birthday last year!

For anyone who is or has been lonesome for anyone who still believes in true love for anyone who is lucky enough to have found their soul mate this film was meant for you. In a way it's a shame more films can't be made with the same quality of story and feeling as this one but that's what makes Lonesome so unique. To wrap this up...there was publicity booklet put out by the Universal Pictures exhibitors in 1928 which describes the plot again without giving the ending away! and ends with the challenge If Ever You Have Seen a More Beautiful or Enjoyable Picture  Please Name It.

It's no more than a little romantic movie of two people who fall in love and then appear to lose each other. But the whole thing is told expertly well. The camera moves about freely in many unique and interesting ways. Visually alone it's quite the spectacle. It also helps that the two in the lead roles are enjoyable.Glenn Tyron is good enough in his lead role but his romantic interest played by Barbara Kent is the real star. She is fun and playful when needed but her soulful eyes convey more pain then most people ever could with their voices. Her charisma is evident from shot one. The only downside to the film is the inclusion of a few sound scenes. Clearly done just to cash in on the new craze it actually only serves to grind the story to a halt. It forces the movie to become stationary and the dialogue itself is pretty inane.I cannot recommend the film strongly enough though. It's as enjoyable of a romance as you'll ever see. There's nothing too complicated here just two people falling in love and it's a joy to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "... and I could say the same thing about Fejos' Broadway made a year later. Fejos recounts the tale of two lonely New Yorkers Jim Glen Tryon and Mary Barbara Kent who find love and each other during a half day holiday at the beach and Coney Island. You first see the workday from Jim and Mary's perspective as they are ruled first by the tyranny of the alarm clock and then the tedium of the workday as you see a clock overlaying the image of each at work. Jim is a lowlevel machine operator and Mary is a telephone operator. Then there are the crowds. Jim and Mary are crowded at breakfast at a diner filled with patrons crowded on the subway crowded at work and crowded at the beach and amusement park. Yet both of them are completely alone in the world which especially in the attractive Miss Kent's case seems somewhat inconceivable.This late era silent has a dearth of title cards which does not subtract from the film's enjoyment. In fact what does subtract just a little are the short dialogue scenes that just don't make sense. One scene is Jim and Mary on the beach suddenly in the dark AND in color with the crowd removed. Nothing they say shines any light on their situation or feelings at all. Another one is in a courtroom where Jim has been detained for being unruly. He gives a speech like a Bolshevik basically shaming the judge and ... the judge lets him go???? This social awareness seems very strange stuff coming from Jim who up to that point has seemed to be a very uncomplicated fellow. Very strange but typical of talking scenes inserted into silent films at the dawn of sound.What is extra special about this film is to see the lives of working class people in 1928. Notice that the workday that Jim and Mary are going through is a Saturday and this was the norm back then and until some time after WWII. People would normally work half a day on Saturday and have only Sunday in its entirety as a day off. Catch this film if you can even if you are not a huge silent film buff.".

Mary is cheery greeting every day with a smile Jim is a jokester the life of the party she is a switchboard operator he is a machinist. But they are lonely and meet after taking the advice of a billboard that encourages people to have a fun day at Coney Island. Jim spies Mary on the bus and tries to attract her attention but it is only at the beach when Jim finds Mary's cherished ring that they get to know each other.The version I saw was all silent with Hungarian titles no less probably packaged for Paul Fejo's own country to show he was much more than a bacteriologist!!! Fejos was another import for Universal who along with Fox thoroughly embraced the European Expressionism movement that peaked in Hollywood in the late 1920s. Fejo didn't stay in America long and by the early 1930s he was back directing in Europe but with Lonesome he included some striking neo expressionistic camera effects including multiple super impositions etc.Like The Crowd the two leads were played by relative unknowns and they were perfect in their roles. Barbara Kent had found fame of sorts by playing the good girl in Flesh and the Devil but who was going to remember her with Greta Garbo playing the villainess. Glen Tryon had failed to make the grade  initially he was a Hal Roach discovery who saw him as another Harold Lloyd. He was also given the role in Fejo's next film Broadway. Both of them are almost too convincing as the lonely couple who as the evening progresses find themselves caring very deeply about the other person. They are separated when the roller coaster that Mary is riding in catches on fire and Jim who is thought of as being a nuisance is hauled off to night court. There is an extended bit of silent dialogue here similar to a scene on the beach where Jim is dreaming of blue picket fences etc which was probably another goat gland sequence.I thought Tryon was very moving  outside cocky but inside eaten up with loneliness. At one stage he says I am so lonely and alone  I can't stand my own company. The emotion and the intentness builds as they look for each other at the fair that is now fast becoming desolate. At the end they both return to their flat overcome by despair  he tries to play records and her little doll the one memory of the day falls off the table and breaks. They then discover that they live in the same building!!!Fejo found the idea in a newspaper article about loneliness in New York but I think it shares similarities with a 1915 film Young Romance. In the older movie two youngsters who unbeknown to themselves work in the same department store read the same romantic serial and go on a week's holiday determined to find some romance at any cost  preferably with someone wealthy. Mary and Jim early in the movie try to pretend to be more exotic that they really are then Mary laughs and says that they have probably both been reading the same romantic serial!!Highly Highly Recommended.".

The pace rarely lets up soon after the male protagonist Jim wakes up. The version I refer to is the Eastman Houserestored film. It's presented in a pristine high definition film transfer from original film stock a nitrate print apparently from France. What a treat to watch life from the early 20th century and the way it seems the storyline could be presented today in modern New York City. This version has music and plenty of sound effects but it's still one of the last silent films of the era. It's a fun treat watching the facial expressions as the performers have to sell their emotions without voices. It must have been a trendsetting piece of filmmaking in its time. I only wish the pace on some of the films made today had as much entertainment packed inside.Packed within the Eastman House print are several scenes with actual dialog between the two and there's also a bit of colortinted BW to boot somewhere in the film. It's worth it for true film buffs to find the restored version. There's no heavy storyline here just a guy finding it hard to meet a woman he finds attractive. The film really gives me another reason to smile.".

	schema:headline " intoxicating dated lovely charming and very much of its time  and experimental wonder";
	schema:reviewBody "Lonesome is like the much more charming if slightly less ambitious and at the very end a bit too cute cousin of Sunrise. It's appeal is in its simplicity but where Sunrise was about a couple breaking apart and coming back together this is much more streamlined and less tragic though it does go for some tragic beats in the last twenty minutes of its slim 70minute runtime boy is lonely girl is lonely both work workingclass jobs factoryphone operator what else in New York city in 1928? they both decide separately after their socalled! friends go off on their own adventures to go to the beach and amusement park  is it Coney Island? I can't imagine it being anywhere else  and boy and girl meet as the boy tries to show off doing games. And that's it that's the movie and why it stands out and got a sortof restoration and Criterion treatment is its presentation by its director.I don't know much about Pal Paul Fejos except that he directed silent films and somewhat into the 1930's and then sort of faded away into obscurity. It's a shame since a film like Lonesome shows his talents clearly he has a keen sense of editing and that way that silent filmmakers sometimes had to superimpose images perhaps a chip off the Abel Gance block perhaps but not as ambitious in particular when he's setting up the hustlebustle of the city and then later in the film when things get more harrowing with the characters. That is to say when inevitably the main conflict is that they are separated in that great sea of people that makes up a massive crowd in a city where as the man Jim notes at one point is so strange that you're surrounded by so many but still feel so alone.The charm in the film comes in how the couple on screen  Barbara Kent and Glenn Tryon  are together they're kind of like if you had one of those romantic leads in those really early Marx brothers movies only they don't sing and the man is funny in that amusing lightly sarcastic way i.e. bragging about his six acres on Wall street at first which we and the girl knows isn't true but it's fun to play along. Actually speaking of that this is an experimental film at heart for a number of reasons. It appears at first to be a silent film and for 90 of it it surely is and is shot like one with that film speed we associate with silent cinema on the whole that kind of slightlyspedup speed where its rhythm is distinctly of its cameras and era and we know this because 10 of the film more or less is a sound film. No really we suddenly move from what is the obvious fluid camera style and wide shots of the crowds and intensity that comes with a camera that moves freely to what is clearly static shots in a studio so the actors are right under a microphone... and the acting is just as static.That's not totally fair this is considered at least according to the trivia one of the very first films to ever incorporate sound. On that level it's certainly extraordinary and important but the problem is that it becomes jarring with the rest of the film which is shot with such passion and excitement it's also frankly weird to hear the actor's speaking voices whereas before like I do with a lot of silent movies I can think of my own voices for the actors that do not sound so... stilted. One of the sound scenes is also one where I wasn't sure if a cop was being sarcastic or not our man Jim has been taken away by the cops after a rollercoaster ride where Mary the girl fainted and had to be taken away but Jim got separated and got rough with a cop. For a moment it seems like he'll be put away but Jim pours his heart out with some I'm sorry cringeinducing lines and the cop's reaction is hard to read since it sounds totally pfft yeah right... but then they let him go.

	onyx:emotionText "Lonesome is like the much more charming if slightly less ambitious and at the very end a bit too cute cousin of Sunrise. It's appeal is in its simplicity but where Sunrise was about a couple breaking apart and coming back together this is much more streamlined and less tragic though it does go for some tragic beats in the last twenty minutes of its slim 70minute runtime boy is lonely girl is lonely both work workingclass jobs factoryphone operator what else in New York city in 1928? they both decide separately after their socalled! friends go off on their own adventures to go to the beach and amusement park  is it Coney Island? I can't imagine it being anywhere else  and boy and girl meet as the boy tries to show off doing games. And that's it that's the movie and why it stands out and got a sortof restoration and Criterion treatment is its presentation by its director.I don't know much about Pal Paul Fejos except that he directed silent films and somewhat into the 1930's and then sort of faded away into obscurity. It's a shame since a film like Lonesome shows his talents clearly he has a keen sense of editing and that way that silent filmmakers sometimes had to superimpose images perhaps a chip off the Abel Gance block perhaps but not as ambitious in particular when he's setting up the hustlebustle of the city and then later in the film when things get more harrowing with the characters. That is to say when inevitably the main conflict is that they are separated in that great sea of people that makes up a massive crowd in a city where as the man Jim notes at one point is so strange that you're surrounded by so many but still feel so alone.The charm in the film comes in how the couple on screen  Barbara Kent and Glenn Tryon  are together they're kind of like if you had one of those romantic leads in those really early Marx brothers movies only they don't sing and the man is funny in that amusing lightly sarcastic way i.e. bragging about his six acres on Wall street at first which we and the girl knows isn't true but it's fun to play along. Actually speaking of that this is an experimental film at heart for a number of reasons. It appears at first to be a silent film and for 90 of it it surely is and is shot like one with that film speed we associate with silent cinema on the whole that kind of slightlyspedup speed where its rhythm is distinctly of its cameras and era and we know this because 10 of the film more or less is a sound film. No really we suddenly move from what is the obvious fluid camera style and wide shots of the crowds and intensity that comes with a camera that moves freely to what is clearly static shots in a studio so the actors are right under a microphone... and the acting is just as static.That's not totally fair this is considered at least according to the trivia one of the very first films to ever incorporate sound. On that level it's certainly extraordinary and important but the problem is that it becomes jarring with the rest of the film which is shot with such passion and excitement it's also frankly weird to hear the actor's speaking voices whereas before like I do with a lot of silent movies I can think of my own voices for the actors that do not sound so... stilted. One of the sound scenes is also one where I wasn't sure if a cop was being sarcastic or not our man Jim has been taken away by the cops after a rollercoaster ride where Mary the girl fainted and had to be taken away but Jim got separated and got rough with a cop. For a moment it seems like he'll be put away but Jim pours his heart out with some I'm sorry cringeinducing lines and the cop's reaction is hard to read since it sounds totally pfft yeah right... but then they let him go. Very strange. But these aren't major complaints for a film that has so much to offer outside of those things. This is a movie that's joy is in its purity that it's about these two people and how they meet and suddenly all of the usual problems of their everyday lives  the work the drudgery the intensity of being around so many people getting onoff the subways or being in the traffic  can float away since they have one another.

There were two much better films made in the same year that Lonesome reminds me of. First King Vidor's The Crowd one of the best films of the period. That one takes place over quite a lot more time but the styles are similar with The Crowd being much more sophisticated in its narrative characterization etc. The Coney Island scenes are probably the most celebrated part of Lonesome but these are nothing compared to those in the Harold Lloyd vehicle Speedy. Fejs exaggerates these scenes beyond belief with so much confetti falling on the Coney Island patrons that one would think the crowd would drown in paper. This film is from the school of silent filmmaking where putting a lot of people on screen at the same time is considered ingenious. In comparison the crowds of Speedy are believable and that sequence is absolutely lovely. Lonesome also suffers from three intrusive sound sequences which Universal forced in at the last minute. They stop the film dead in its tracks but they are somewhat funny. Overall the film is entertaining if not too memorable. One particular sequence stands out as masterful the man's and woman's workdays edited back to back with the whole screen surrounded by the numbers on a clock translucent hands following the time. 710.".

One of the best and most sprightly comedies of the early fifties Otto Preminger had a fight on his hands when the film went before an aghast Production Code board.The movie makes rather light of a young woman's commitment to chastity suggests that seduction is an amusing and acceptable pastime for a single male and uses words like pregnant and virgin offhandedly.  The lovely talkative selfassured Patty even demands to know the meaning of the charge by her new boyfriend's barely exgirlfriend that she's a professional virgin.  Shocking stuff and approval was denied. Perhaps equally stunning to the Hollywood censors was Preminger's decision to release the film without approval something he had the clout to do.As it turned out audiences were able to deal with this explosive material.   And almost fifty years later when virtually nothing remains to be said or done on the silver screen this film retains its charm humor and attractiveness because a superb trio of actors  William Holden Maggie McNamara and an irrepressible David Niven who steals some of the scenes  gives a timeless quality to their sterling performances.The script hews pretty much to the original play with minimal set changes. The dialogue is witty and fast.  Preminger knew he had created a gem of a romantic comedy and it's good entertainment today in a world where the values expressed by the characters seem as remote as the social customs of the Neandertals.  I hadn't seen the film in decades  I rented it and I'm going to buy a copy.  This is a true and timeless classic.By the way don't skip the trailer that precedes the film.  It's very funny.".

After dinner she would always drawl wasn't them popovers good?. He stood all he could of this airhead until one day when he hit her across the rear end with a hot popover pan. He said  it raised quite a welt although I was not privileged to see it. When Peggy later says her feet hurt he says never say your feet hurt. My foot hurts singular is acceptable but to say my feet hurt is a rather sordid admission. The fact that I am writing these lines from memory will tell you how much fun I had watching this movie over and over. William Holden was the king of the movies as far as I'm concerned and he was charming and at his best in this movie. He made more really good memorable movies than Clark Gable could have hoped for. This movie is not well known and as far as I'm able to find out is not available of DVD. I'm hoping is will be eventually because it's a nice funny little movie that shows New York in it's heyday.".

I was interested to see what would be the content of such an older film with it's steamy description. To my surprised it was extremely entertaining and lighthearted... or am I just hardened by the times that we live in. Anyway... I enjoyed the situational comedy which in some ways reminded me of an Elvis Presley movie called Live a Little Love a Little in the way that it changes pace but keeps the main characters interesting as they carry out the story. I also enjoyed seeing the way that a playboys life in the early 50's was perceived and I also enjoyed going back in time and seeing the behavior of the characters as they related to the story and it's topics. Had the industry not been so hard with its rating for this film... I think it could have been turned into a wonderful sitcom for TV in the 1950's... but that's just my opinion. Overall it was an enjoyable light hearted comedy about sex or lack of that made me happy that I found it so late at night with all the other offerings that could have detoured my attention. This was only a few years before my days began but I could easily see these kinds of characters living out the story in real life as it was back in those days. The writers did a fantastic job with their use of language especially because had this been remade today most young people probably would be at a tremendous lost for words to make this type of film work as well as it did. There is much to learn about using language properly to tell a story... one that would have worked just as well if it were only on radio. Todays film values are all too visual and sorely lacks verbal entertainment which this film provides in great quantity and quality. I am glad to have found this gem in the rough.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE MOON IS BLUE is a comedy based on a stage play about the kooky happenings one evening when a playboy bachelor brings an innocent young woman back to his apartment for dinner.This racy comedy never earned a Production Code certification. It was very controversial in the 1950s for its frankness about sex and its use of taboo words like virgin mistress and pregnant. It's nothing outrageous by modernday standards but it is noticeably upfront for '50s Hollywood.The hijinks involves four characters an architect bachelor William Holden a frank young woman Maggie McNamara the witty upstairs neighbor David Niven and his daughter the architect's jilted ex Dawn Addams. Both men find themselves strangely attracted to the girl who bewilders them with her bluntness and honesty. The night is filled with misunderstandings and screwy surprises. It's a fun film though stagey.William Holden and David Niven bring Alist talent to the production and neither disappoints. It's actually pretty cool to see their different styles on display in the same scene. The eversmooth Holden with his rain coat and masculine virility and the delightfully witty Niven with his proper grammar and trimmed mustache.David Niven is by far my favorite thing about this movie. He is hilarious in his role as the ineffectual father of Holden's quasipsychotic exgirlfriend. He comes downstairs to Holden's apartment because his daughter has told him that Holden had done her wrong. Holden defends himself explaining that she'd spent the night in his bedroom while he slept on the couch. Niven ponders the situation and decides that maybe that was how Holden had wronged her. A very humiliating experience. I probably should beat you up anyway. His comedic reactions throughout the film are great. Never far from a cocktail and never at a loss for an eloquent witticism Niven's at the top of his game here.I saw this rare film on TCM and the print was pretty poor. Aside from the dirty image quality there were several abrupt cuts missing framesfootage? and even inconsistent audio levels. I guess this film wasn't taken very good care of over the decades. Still the print is certainly watchable and the movie is an interesting piece of Hollywood history. And there are some real laughs too.".

The Moon is Blue is a comedy based on a play about an outspoken naive virgin named Patty Maggie McNamara who meets Donald William Holden on top of the Empire State Building goes to his apartment and meets his divorced neighbor David Slater David Niven whose daughter Donald just broke up with. The night goes on and on with Cynthia the old girlfriend showing up David getting drunk Patty's policeman father Tom Tully appearing etc.THIS is this scandalous adult film? Hello the words virgin and mistress are used apparently forbidden by that blasted code. Good for Preminger and the producers for ignoring them.Holden and Niven are excellent and Holden looks especially handsome in this. Maggie McNamara holds her own against them with no problem. She was a vivacious petite actress who reminds one of Debbie Reynolds. An experienced stage actress when Preminger signed her to do this film McNamara had played the role in the national company of the play for over a year. More films and television followed for about 10 years but when she died at the age of 48 she was working as a typist. It's difficult to think that this freshfaced young woman died early and in such sad circumstances.The Moon is Blue is interesting for its historical significance as it is one of the films that helped break the code. However that's about it. Otherwise it's a wellacted light comedy that's a little talky by today's standards.".

But ripples it did stir and all told it's a pretty effective study of manners etiquette and sexual understandings. Directed by Otto Preminger and based on F. Hugh Herbert's cheeky play of the film's title it stars William Holden David Niven and Maggie McNamara. Plot essentially revolves around McNamara holding onto her virginity as the male predators close in. If she holds firm she will of course snare the man she is meant to be with.It's a bit talky and too mired in its stage origins at times but there's a waspish deliberation about the humour that holds attention and the performances in conjunction with Preminger's agile camera techniques are well worth investment. More curio than essential cinema but enjoyable and rich with characterisations of worth. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching The Moon Is Blue today is watching a rather ordinary comedy that had a respectable run on Broadway 924 performances in the 1951 1953 season that got blown totally out of proportion because of the attendant publicity.More tickets were sold for this film more publicity was generated for this film than the hype of a dozen press agents by the actions of the censors in this case the Catholic Legion Of Decency who objected to the words 'pregnant' and 'virgin' being in the script. But isn't that always the case tell people something is banned and they flock to see it out of curiosity if nothing else.Otto Preminger directed the play on Broadway and brought it here to the cinema and expanded it a bit for the screen. The roles of the cab driver Gregory Ratoff the TV singer Fortunio Bonanova interestingly enough the daughter of David Niven Dawn Addams did not exist in the original play. It was a four person comedy with a cast that included Barbara Bel Geddes Barry Nelson Donald Cook and Ralph Dunn playing the parts that went to Maggie McNamara William Holden David Niven and Tom Tully.However Maggie McNamara did play the lead in the national touring company and Preminger did bring her to Hollywood. She even received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress but lost that year to a very similar actress in a similar role Audrey Hepburn for Roman Holiday.The wolfish William Holden spots McNamara leaving his building and follows her up to the top of the Empire State Building observation deck. You know the old saying he pursued her enough until she decided to let him catch her. They go back to his apartment where she also arouses the interest in an old rou in the person of neighbor David Niven. Holden was going out for a bit with his daughter Dawn Addams. The two pursue her for the rest of the film and you figure out who she winds up with.This is the plot of a gazillion comedies and the mere use of a couple of forbidden words elevated The Moon Is Blue to something way beyond what it actually merited. The Moon Is Blue also got Oscar nominations for the title song and for film editing.This film did not lead to a brilliant film career for Maggie McNamara. That tragic woman did a couple of better films Prince Of Players and Three Coins In The Fountain and then Otto Preminger also cast her in The Cardinal. All of those were better than The Moon Is Blue for which she was nominated.Looking at that film almost 60 years later you scratch your head and wonder what the big deal was with his movie.".

Her performance here as the slightly kooky Patty is eyecatching in my book at least. Yet her career appears to have sputtered not long after.

When they get the film at the 4077th they are both appalled at how unfunny and tame it is. Enough said.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very surprising film to watch. After all for 1953 it's amazingly frank about sexa subject you just didn't talk about in films at that time due to the Production Code. However somehow Otto Preminger got away with a very 'dirty' filmthough by today's standards it's pretty tame.The film begins with William Holden trying to pick up a woman Maggie McNamara. However almost immediately it becomes obvious that this is a bizarre woman. She just isn't normaland is very frank in discussing premarital sex with Holden though she insists on retaining her virginity! In fact it's one of the first films after the Production Code was enacted in 1934 to use the Vword'virgin'! Holden takes her homewhere it soon becomes apparent he is quite the playboy and has just broken up with another girl. Oddly the girl's father David Niven drops in and stars making passes at McNamara and from then on it's a contest to see which guy will get this girl by the end of the movie.Despite its blunt attitude about sex the film is enjoyable and there is a quirky strangeness about McNamara's character that makes her likable. Not a great film by any standard but enjoyable and an interesting film because of its moral compass...which is apparently a tad bent.".

This is really theater with limited sets and 3 main characters who continually talk with very little physical movement. Not much for a teenager  except that it didn't receive the Breen Hollywood Seal of Approval because of the use of sexy words like virgin pregnant and seduce. I like so many others had to see this picture  just like I had to see The Outlaw. Unfortunately nothing really sexy happens and it was a real let down in more then one way.But now although the story is totally ridiculous two adult men wanting to marry a 23 year old wisenheimer after just meeting her I really enjoyed David Niven. He looks great has the best lines in the film and drinks enormous unbelievable amounts of alcohol. Poor Maggie McNamara and I mean poor Maggie who committed suicide at 48 doesn't really look like Audrey Hepburn at all  her close ups are a little scary. This was her first movie after modeling her figure makes it hard to believe. And her speaking voice is really very unusual and ultimately very annoying yet she received an Academy nomination. William Holden is totally artificial and although he was 35 at the time he sadly looks so much older.So why did I enjoy this. NivenNivenNiven and the 50's apartment sets and the 50's mentality with a little bit of Dawn Addams to boot. My favorite line Holden Why are you so preoccupied with sex?

They bottle rock oil and sell it as an elixir. Dunne sings and dances in the show while daddy hawks the tonic. William Frawley plays a fake Indian who is also part of the show. After their wagon burns down they are taken in by a local farmer Randolph Scott and his grandmother Elizabeth Patterson. Of course Scott and Dunne fall in love but Scott is sidetracked by his ideas for drilling for oil in 1850s Pennsylvania.Songs romance and action combine to make this an unusual film as the couple battles the local bible thumpers as well as the crooked railroad men led by Alan Hale. Along the way Dunne rescues a saloon singer Dorothy Lamour and runs away with a traveling circus. They pack a lot of story into this 112minute film.Dunne is as always a total pleasure to watch. She gets to sing almost all the songs in this musical Scott never sings and duets with Lamour on Allegheny Al. The best song is the wonderful The Folks Who Live on the Hill which Dunne sings in closeup with a gentle breeze rustling apple blossoms and her lace bonnet. Scott is good in a role usually played by Joel McCrea but Scott and Dunne have good chemistry. They also worked together in Roberta and My Favorite Wife. Supporting cast is fine headed by Patterson as the feisty grandmother Walburn as the father Frawley as the Indian he also gets a number Ben Blue as a mute Lamour as the dumbcluck who sings The Things I Want in fabulous closeup Hale as the corrupt railroad man Helen Lowell as a gossip Irving Pichel as the bible thumper and Akim Tamiroff as the saloon owner. Also of note is Charles Bickford is the bully. Bickford had starred with Dunne is the previous No Other Woman. Worth looking for.".

	schema:reviewBody "HIGH WIDE AND HANDSOME Paramount 1937 directed by Rouben Mamoulian is an underrated musicaldrama set in the great outdoors of old Pennsylvania circa the 1850s. Done in elaborate style it stars Irene Dunne following her recent success to the 1936 screen version of SHOW BOAT Universal. Currently riding high and wide with her brief cinematic period in movie musicals 19351938 before focusing more on comedy and dramas Dunne is cast opposite the tall and rugged Randolph Scott for the second time the first being ROBERTA RKO Radio 1935 opposite Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. With a handful of contemporary song and dance college and backstage musicals hitting the theaters during this period HIGH WIDE AND HANDSOME is the title pertaining to Randolph Scott or the scenery of old Pennsylvania? takes a different turn in locale combining outdoorsy western scenery with songs that has been said to have been an inspiration to the highly popular Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway 1943 musical OKLAHOMA and others like it.The story begins with Sally Watterson Irene Dunne a young girl traveling with her medicine sideshow father named Doc Raymond Walburn singing the title song as they settle in a western Pennsylvania town. As Doc tries selling some medicine bottles to his patrons which proves to be a fraud by spectator Peter Cortlandt Randolph Scott a fight ensues amongst the crowd damaging their wagon. Being given the hospitality of her home by Peter's grandmother Elizabeth Patterson the stranded Sally earns her keep by helping with the farm animals and soon gets to know and love Peter a rugged oil prospector whom she eventually marries. Their marriage at first is a happy union until Peter neglects his wife in favor of keeping his promise with the neighboring farmers by banding together in laying oil pipelines in order to prevent Red Scanlon Charles Bickford a corrupt railroad president from monopolizing the industry. After Sally is found entertaining on top of the table in the barroom with Molly Dorothy Lamour a saloon girl she and Peter had earlier rescued from a lynch mob the couple find themselves in an argument which sends Sally to leave her husband and return to life entertaining in the passing circus show and to her father while Peter tries to fulfill his pipeline dream which at the present time proves to be more important than trying to find Sally and resolve matters. The elaborate and well staged sequence with thousands of prospectors racing against time to get the gigantic oil pipeline finished on schedule is almost similar to King Vidor's conclusion of OUR DAILY BREAD 1934 where the farmhands are seen rushing to ditch a waterway in order to save their dying crops but with this production an added bonus of rugged fighting scenes and one near miss scene adding to the suspense in which the unconscious Scott is nearly crushed by a falling pipe that lands inches from his head. Whew!Almost forgotten today and rarely seen in recent years HIGH WIDE AND HANDSOME has its share of good tunes with music and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and Jerome Kern including High Wide and Handsome The Simple Maiden Can I Forget You? all sung by Irene Dunne Will You Marry Me Tomorrow Maria? sung by William Frawley The Folks Who Live on the Hill sung by Irene Dunne The Things I Want sung by Dorothy Lamour Allegheny Al sung by Dunne and Lamour and Can I Forget You? reprise by Dunne. Of the songs The Folks Who Live on the Hill sung by Irene Dunne wearing her oldfashioned wedding gown comes off best and memorably as she sings it to her new husband Peter Scott after showing her the dwelling they are to live. Another memorable moment is seeing William Frawley years before his I Love Lucy TV series days in the 1950s in full voice singing Will You Marry Me Tomorrow during a ceremony. While Irene Dunne is no Jeanette MacDonald or Grace Moore when it comes to vocalizing many forget how well she singing delivery is and she does it quite well but unfortunately on the whole the songs did not become as immortal as the other Hammerstein and Kern scores.In the supporting cast are Alan Hale as Walt Brennan the head of the transportation syndicate Akim Tamiroff as the foreign gambler Joe Varese Irving Pichel as Mr. Stark Lucien Littlefield Purnell B. Pratt and some light comedy relief supplied by Ben Blue playing Zeke a hired hand. Raymond Walburn a fine character actor appearing here as Irene Dunne's father performs his task well almost as if this role were intended with W.C. Fields in mind especially with similarities in his medicine show man who tries to defraud his public with phony medicine bottles etc.Running ten minutes short of two hours HIGH WIDE AND HANDSOME is entertaining quite original for its time but sadly a neglected item. A lot of effort went into this nostalgic production and it shows. The only thing missing and a real oversight is Technicolor. Around this time Paramount produced some fine Technicolor outdoors films notably THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE 1936 with Sylvia Sidney and EBB TIDE 1937 with Frances Farmer. How cinematic this handsome film would have looked in color. But overlooking this minor flaw it's a movie worth seeing through once and after its THE END title and list of actors and their roles and underscoring to The Folks Who Live on the Hill before the final fadeout it may make one wonder why this is among the rarelyseen westerntype musicals gems of the golden age of Hollywood period. 12".

As Doc tries selling some medicine bottles to his patrons which proves to be a fraud by spectator Peter Cortlandt Randolph Scott a fight ensues amongst the crowd damaging their wagon. Being given the hospitality of her home by Peter's grandmother Elizabeth Patterson the stranded Sally earns her keep by helping with the farm animals and soon gets to know and love Peter a rugged oil prospector whom she eventually marries. Their marriage at first is a happy union until Peter neglects his wife in favor of keeping his promise with the neighboring farmers by banding together in laying oil pipelines in order to prevent Red Scanlon Charles Bickford a corrupt railroad president from monopolizing the industry. After Sally is found entertaining on top of the table in the barroom with Molly Dorothy Lamour a saloon girl she and Peter had earlier rescued from a lynch mob the couple find themselves in an argument which sends Sally to leave her husband and return to life entertaining in the passing circus show and to her father while Peter tries to fulfill his pipeline dream which at the present time proves to be more important than trying to find Sally and resolve matters. The elaborate and well staged sequence with thousands of prospectors racing against time to get the gigantic oil pipeline finished on schedule is almost similar to King Vidor's conclusion of OUR DAILY BREAD 1934 where the farmhands are seen rushing to ditch a waterway in order to save their dying crops but with this production an added bonus of rugged fighting scenes and one near miss scene adding to the suspense in which the unconscious Scott is nearly crushed by a falling pipe that lands inches from his head. Whew!Almost forgotten today and rarely seen in recent years HIGH WIDE AND HANDSOME has its share of good tunes with music and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and Jerome Kern including High Wide and Handsome The Simple Maiden Can I Forget You? all sung by Irene Dunne Will You Marry Me Tomorrow Maria? sung by William Frawley The Folks Who Live on the Hill sung by Irene Dunne The Things I Want sung by Dorothy Lamour Allegheny Al sung by Dunne and Lamour and Can I Forget You? reprise by Dunne. Of the songs The Folks Who Live on the Hill sung by Irene Dunne wearing her oldfashioned wedding gown comes off best and memorably as she sings it to her new husband Peter Scott after showing her the dwelling they are to live. Another memorable moment is seeing William Frawley years before his I Love Lucy TV series days in the 1950s in full voice singing Will You Marry Me Tomorrow during a ceremony. While Irene Dunne is no Jeanette MacDonald or Grace Moore when it comes to vocalizing many forget how well she singing delivery is and she does it quite well but unfortunately on the whole the songs did not become as immortal as the other Hammerstein and Kern scores.In the supporting cast are Alan Hale as Walt Brennan the head of the transportation syndicate Akim Tamiroff as the foreign gambler Joe Varese Irving Pichel as Mr. Stark Lucien Littlefield Purnell B. Pratt and some light comedy relief supplied by Ben Blue playing Zeke a hired hand. Raymond Walburn a fine character actor appearing here as Irene Dunne's father performs his task well almost as if this role were intended with W.C. Fields in mind especially with similarities in his medicine show man who tries to defraud his public with phony medicine bottles etc.Running ten minutes short of two hours HIGH WIDE AND HANDSOME is entertaining quite original for its time but sadly a neglected item. A lot of effort went into this nostalgic production and it shows. The only thing missing and a real oversight is Technicolor. Around this time Paramount produced some fine Technicolor outdoors films notably THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE 1936 with Sylvia Sidney and EBB TIDE 1937 with Frances Farmer. How cinematic this handsome film would have looked in color. But overlooking this minor flaw it's a movie worth seeing through once and after its THE END title and list of actors and their roles and underscoring to The Folks Who Live on the Hill before the final fadeout it may make one wonder why this is among the rarelyseen westerntype musicals gems of the golden age of Hollywood period. 12";

Irene has several beautiful numbers including the classic The Folks Who Live on the Hill. Dorothy Lamour is also excellent as the saloon singer who at one point is run out of town by the prudish good people of the area and sings the very lovely The Things I Want.

While not a classic and not without it's flaws the oil saga with good guys fighting powerful villains has perhaps been done in too many old films and the surprise heroes of the final reel give a rather absurd touch to the climax it deserves to be seen and it's excellent songs and performances and beautiful set design and cinematography make it a quite memorable movie musical.".

	schema:reviewBody "Irene Dunne had the good fortune in her singing films to have one of the greatest of American composers writing for her. In her career she did the lead roles in such Jerome Kern classics as Showboat Roberta and Sweet Adeline. And also she Kern write songs for the screen for her in Joy of Living and this film High Wide and Handsome. She was for a while known as the Jerome Kern girl of the screen.For reasons I don't understand except for Showboat she was not given a singing leading man. The story lines were rewritten to give her all the good songs and the leading man none. Not that Donald Woods in Sweet Adeline or Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in Joy of Living or Randolph Scott in Roberta and High Wide and Handsome had any ambitions to sing but it might have been nice to have her teamed with someone like Allan Jones again as she was in Showboat.High Wide and Handsome is set in western Pennsylvania just after Edwin L. Drake invented the first practical oil derrick to drill for the stuff. Up to that time oil was considered a nuisance at best a positive calamity at worst for some poor farmer who had the stuff oozing through to his soil. Randolph Scott is such a farmer who has the idea of marketing for heating fuel. Others agree with him including Alan Hale who is in a part normally reserved for Edward Arnold. He's the boss of the railroad and who would be shipping the stuff and at the rate he determines but him only. Not beaten Scott conceives the idea of the first oil pipeline and then its a fight to the finish with the Hale and the railroad. By the way in real life this is how John D. Rockefeller cornered the oil market and gave the Rockefeller family the wealth it enjoys today.Irene Dunne is in a medicine show that breaks down and she Raymond Walburn and William Frawley are given shelter by Scott and his grandmother Elizabeth Patterson. Of course the usual boygirl stuff happens.Scott's an earnest of guy but a bit of a prude as well. Later on when Dunne aids another entertainer in trouble Dorothy Lamour Scott and she break up when he finds the two of them trying to put over an act in a saloon to get her hired.Two very big songs for Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II came out of High Wide and Handsome both sung by Dunne Can I Forget You and The Folks Who Live On The Hill. Again this was a case of one hand washing the other as Paramount no doubt convinced the leading singer in America who by no coincidence was a Paramount contact player to record them and plug them on his radio show. Bing Crosby's records of them are classic and they sold a few platters back in the day. In fact why didn't they have Bing in this film? It certainly had more of a budget than the musicals Paramount was giving him. Other villains in High Wide and Handsome are Charles Bickford and Irving Pichel. Bickford is just a plug ugly who does Hale's dirty work and probably would pay Hale to do it for him as he and Scott hate each other and that's made clear right at the beginning of the film. Irving Pichel plays a strange Puritan type individual self appointed keeper of the community morals. His was a strangely underdeveloped character in the script that Oscar Hammerstein II wrote.Rouben Mamoulian who directed his fair share of musicals on screen and on the stage did a good job with his cast. And you can never go wrong listening and singing Jerome Kern's wonderful songs.".

	schema:headline " A multigenre entertaining film worthy of classic preservation";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a lot packed into this film and it's all top quality. High Wide and Handsome is a musical with some light humor. It's a love story and drama. It's a pioneering story with adventure intrigue and crime. It's historical for the time and subjects covered and the authenticity of the costume and sets. About the only thing it's not but which it is billed as is a Western. Perhaps any movie that has horses in it or that's set before the advent of the automobile is considered Western by Hollywood. But I doubt if many movie fans or anyone would consider a setting in Pennsylvania to constitute a Western movie.This is a superb and entertaining movie. Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein collaborated for the music and lyrics and Hammerstein helped write the story. It has a complex plot with a few subplots but the screenplay is excellent and the direction shooting and film editing enable one to follow the story well. Add an excellent cast and firstrate performances by all and High Wide and Handsome is a wonderful interesting and satisfying film. The title comes from a song that Irene Dunne sings in an early scene. The very talented Dunne has top billing as the female lead Sally Watterson. She plays the young daughter of a medicine show shyster Doc Watterson played by Raymond Walburn. Dunne was nearly 40 years old when this film was made but appears to be in her young 20s. She didn't get started in Hollywood until she was 32 in 1930 but quickly rose to stardom. Her tremendous talent ranged from drama to comedy and included a great singing voice which she used in this film. Randolph Scott also was 39 years old when this film was made and he seems to be in his youthful early 20s. Within a couple of years Scott's appearance would change so that in most of his films he comes across as more his real middle age. Both Dunne and Scott give wonderful performances in this film  running the gamut from light humor to seriousness with very dramatic and intense scenes and then to tender moments. The supporting cast all excel as well. Alan Hale is out of his usual character and plays the tyrant in this film but still with a jovial nature. He is Walt Brennan a railroad tycoon who wants to take over the thriving oil discoveries around Titusville. I think it's interesting that the name of the railroad doesn't appear anywhere in the film. Perhaps Hollywood was getting too close to the truth where fiction might begin to resemble real history. Charles Bickford is very good as the bitter meanspirited Red Scanlon who has been feuding all his life with Cortlandt. Other superb performances are given by most of the supporting cast. Walburn is very good as Doc and William Frawley is very good as his assistant Mac. Dorothy Lamour is Molly Fuller who sings a couple of very good songs. Elizabeth Patterson is superb as Grandma Cortlandt and Akim Tamiroff was very good in a minor role as Joe Varese. The neighbors and friends of Peter and some of the circus and carnival players are very good. Much of the historical and pioneering aspects of the film may have been lost on the audiences of 1937 but in the 21st century those help make this movie a classic to be preserved for posterity. The story takes place in 1858 and one of the main plots of the film concerns the drilling of the first oil wells. In fact the first producing oil well in North America was established that year 1858 at Oil Springs in Ontario Canada. And the first well to be drilled successfully in the U.S. was in 1859 at Titusville PA. That's where this story takes place only the well driller isn't the historical Col. Edwin Drake but Peter Cortlandt played by Randolph Scott. Beside the costumes and pioneer period sets the movie has some wonderful scenes of props that were the true items of the period. This is one of only a couple of movies I can recall that showed lighting of public places with huge chandeliers of candles. In a late scene this film has two such chandeliers with many dozens of candles on each. They are in a circus tent when Sally comes out to sing a song. Men in Indian costumes first set up a small circle stage for her to stand on in the middle of ring. Then they surround the small stage and crouch down holding torches to illuminate the stage. Of course the movie doesn't need the torches for the light in the film but Paramount gets credit for showing this and other aspects about the time realistically. Here are some other things that the film showed authentically. A wedding portrait took 115 seconds to shoot  with the photographer counting. Its no wonder that very old photos don't appear clear and sharp before the use of flash photography. When the oil well comes in and oil shoots through the derrick the wedding party is drenched with oil. And the building of the pipeline above ground is a touch of reality from the past. The oil discovery and drilling near Titusville PA was the birth of the oil industry in America. Here's my favorite lines from the film. For more dialog samples see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page for the movie. Mac I'll bet Sally will be glad to get away from here. Doc Watterson You think so Mac? Mac Sure. She's always fightin' with that Cortlandt fella. She hates the sight of him. Doc Watterson You know human nature don't you Mac? Mac From A to Z. Doc Watterson You must have skipped W. The women come under W.".

	onyx:emotionText "There's a lot packed into this film and it's all top quality. High Wide and Handsome is a musical with some light humor. It's a love story and drama. It's a pioneering story with adventure intrigue and crime. It's historical for the time and subjects covered and the authenticity of the costume and sets. About the only thing it's not but which it is billed as is a Western. Perhaps any movie that has horses in it or that's set before the advent of the automobile is considered Western by Hollywood. But I doubt if many movie fans or anyone would consider a setting in Pennsylvania to constitute a Western movie.This is a superb and entertaining movie. Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein collaborated for the music and lyrics and Hammerstein helped write the story. It has a complex plot with a few subplots but the screenplay is excellent and the direction shooting and film editing enable one to follow the story well. Add an excellent cast and firstrate performances by all and High Wide and Handsome is a wonderful interesting and satisfying film. The title comes from a song that Irene Dunne sings in an early scene. The very talented Dunne has top billing as the female lead Sally Watterson. She plays the young daughter of a medicine show shyster Doc Watterson played by Raymond Walburn. Dunne was nearly 40 years old when this film was made but appears to be in her young 20s. She didn't get started in Hollywood until she was 32 in 1930 but quickly rose to stardom. Her tremendous talent ranged from drama to comedy and included a great singing voice which she used in this film. Randolph Scott also was 39 years old when this film was made and he seems to be in his youthful early 20s. Within a couple of years Scott's appearance would change so that in most of his films he comes across as more his real middle age. Both Dunne and Scott give wonderful performances in this film  running the gamut from light humor to seriousness with very dramatic and intense scenes and then to tender moments. The supporting cast all excel as well. Alan Hale is out of his usual character and plays the tyrant in this film but still with a jovial nature. He is Walt Brennan a railroad tycoon who wants to take over the thriving oil discoveries around Titusville. I think it's interesting that the name of the railroad doesn't appear anywhere in the film. Perhaps Hollywood was getting too close to the truth where fiction might begin to resemble real history. Charles Bickford is very good as the bitter meanspirited Red Scanlon who has been feuding all his life with Cortlandt. Other superb performances are given by most of the supporting cast. Walburn is very good as Doc and William Frawley is very good as his assistant Mac. Dorothy Lamour is Molly Fuller who sings a couple of very good songs. Elizabeth Patterson is superb as Grandma Cortlandt and Akim Tamiroff was very good in a minor role as Joe Varese.

It's about Randolph Scott his singing bride Irene Dunne and oil wells in Pennsylvania. Like a monopoly game this takes the viewer a chance to ride on the Pennsylvania railroad through a little town named Titusville just spitting distance from Lake Erie. Like many musicals set in this era it starts with a medicine man Raymond Walburn introducing his daughter Dunne who sings the title song an instant hatred between Scott and brutish Charles Bickford a fire that destroys Walburn's wagon and their being invited to stay with Scott's no nonsense granny Elizabeth Patterson and the sudden love between Dunne and Scott.Songs by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II give the impression that this is an intended followup for Dunne after the previous year's tremendously successful film version of Show Boat. It's certainly unique but the story isn't anywhere near as groundbreaking as that was although it is unique. Songs pretty decent too.In her first scene saloon singer Dorothy Lamour looks rather garish like something out of a Carol Burnett show sketch. Her attempts to emulate Helen Morgan fall short although she does play an important part in Scott's rivalry with Bickford and the equally ruthless Alan Hale Sr. whose overly high prices to ship Scott's oil causes him to create the pipeline. Patterson as usual has some great moments even getting to sing a bit of the title song in a duet with Dunne. A youngish William Frawley also adds a few laughs as one of the medicine show employees getting to sing solo as well.".

I occasionally surf the Instant Queue section using my Xbox 360 to find some TV show I can never keep up with a short film or even a full length film I've heard nothing about. When I saw the title it got my attention. When I saw Michael Landes in the cast I pressed play. Ever since seeing Final Destination 2 in 2003 I've had a man crush on Landes. Not much has changed about his persona or way of acting since 2003. That's a good thing.The film to my knowledge was in very limited release. It had almost ZERO marketing at all and very few critics had reviewed it. It's a damn shame too because I wasted time seeing Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Grown Ups when I could've been seeing this feel good cleverly made romcom.Ethan Gorman is a stressed out hopeless writer who after his recent publishing rejection is now thinks of giving up writing. As he sits alone and stressed at a coffee shop he runs into a young divorced girl named Jesse Milano. Jesse and Ethan get to talking and socializing and it ends with Jesse giving Ethan her phone number.Right after a happy Ethan leaves the shop an older confident advertising executive comes in the shop and starts to socialize with Jesse as well. Jesse now finds herself in the mix of two different guys and she is torn on which one she will pick. This is where Jesse's life begins to hit a point of confusion and stress over Mr. Right.The best part about the film is the ending. I will not spoil anything but it's one of the most unexpected endings I've seen in recent years. There is not a whole lot to say about My Girlfriend's Boyfriend other than that it's a very humble yet interesting film. It's got easy romantic dialog that flows nicely as well as three young and vibrant cast members I look forward to seeing more of.Especially Alyssa Milano as I'm eagerly awaiting the release of Hall Pass.Starring Alyssa Milano Beau Bridges Michael Landes and Christopher Gorham. Directed by Daryn Tufts.".

When I saw the title it got my attention. When I saw Michael Landes in the cast I pressed play. Ever since seeing Final Destination 2 in 2003 I've had a man crush on Landes. Not much has changed about his persona or way of acting since 2003. That's a good thing.The film to my knowledge was in very limited release. It had almost ZERO marketing at all and very few critics had reviewed it. It's a damn shame too because I wasted time seeing Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Grown Ups when I could've been seeing this feel good cleverly made romcom.Ethan Gorman is a stressed out hopeless writer who after his recent publishing rejection is now thinks of giving up writing. As he sits alone and stressed at a coffee shop he runs into a young divorced girl named Jesse Milano. Jesse and Ethan get to talking and socializing and it ends with Jesse giving Ethan her phone number.Right after a happy Ethan leaves the shop an older confident advertising executive comes in the shop and starts to socialize with Jesse as well. Jesse now finds herself in the mix of two different guys and she is torn on which one she will pick. This is where Jesse's life begins to hit a point of confusion and stress over Mr. Right.The best part about the film is the ending. I will not spoil anything but it's one of the most unexpected endings I've seen in recent years. There is not a whole lot to say about My Girlfriend's Boyfriend other than that it's a very humble yet interesting film. It's got easy romantic dialog that flows nicely as well as three young and vibrant cast members I look forward to seeing more of.Especially Alyssa Milano as I'm eagerly awaiting the release of Hall Pass.Starring Alyssa Milano Beau Bridges Michael Landes and Christopher Gorham. Directed by Daryn Tufts.";

Milano stars and is also the producer so somewhat a vanity project but she is very good in it.Alyssa Milano is Jesse Young working as a waitress at a small caf in Utah. She is bright and friendly and enters into smalltalk banter easily with the customers.Christopher Gorham is Ethan Reed writer but having trouble getting published. We see a meeting with his publisher and she tells him he needs to come up with better ideas.When Ethan is in Jesse's caf she notices him writing in a journal they strike up a conversation he goes away with her phone number and permission to call it.But just after he leaves Michael Landes as Troy Parker comes into the caf and also strikes up a conversation with Jesse and also leaves with her number. Troy is more handsome wealthier and seemingly more attractive in all areas than is Ethan.So much of the running time of the movie is witnessing Jesse dating and starting to fall in love with two men Ethan and Troy and she seems to like them equally. Quite a quandary which is worked out very well in the final scenes. My wife and I enjoyed this movie a bit better than its IMDb rating would suggest.MAJOR SPOILERS In fact Troy did not exist at all. Ethan was the only one dating Jesse. After Ethan's meeting with his publisher Carol Kane he decided to use his own experiences but write in a more interesting character and he came up with Troy. So as Ethan and Jesse go about doing things and deepening their relationship we see that played out as Troy and Jesse the story of his new book which when he is finished becomes his first published work. Jesse however was reluctant to commit to Ethan a great guy because she knew he wanted a family but she cannot have children a fact that broke up her first marriage. But Ethan assures her adopting children will be fine he is committed to her. They end up happily ever after.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was disappointed to say the least. This movie has me torn. While its execution was fairly precise I felt cheated. The 'twist' at the end pretty much negates the entire movie tagline poster and advertising and is basically telling you that the movie you came in expecting to see does not exist. In fact the actual story is a good deal shorter and simpler and really not much of a movie at all as it could be told in about twenty minutes.This is what the films website says it's about 'Jesse Alyssa Milano is a sassy intelligent woman who has yet to find Mr. Rightuntil she bumps into Ethan Christopher Gorham a writer pushed to the edge of despair after having another novel rejected by publishers. For Jesse the encounter offers more than a chance to inspire the artist in Ethan again. It also opens a new romantic chapter in her life... with one huge complication. Moments after meeting the perfect guy for her Jesse meets Mr. Perfect Troy Michael Landes a confident and successful advertising executive who makes almost every moment elegant and romantic. Soon Jesse is in over her head and grappling with the ultimate romantic paradox what does a girl do when she meets Mr. Right after already meeting the right guy?'Except that its not.From the get go the film gives you a GIANT clue as to what is going on and if you get it well then you spend pretty much the entire movie bored as you know that half of what you're watching is not real and thus there is no conflict at all except the one the love interest Jesse Alyssa Milano creates for herself. Now let me explain why I called Jesse the love interest. The film is not about her contrary to all the posters and the trailer and the tagline the film is about a writer who keeps inserting himself into his stories which makes them unappealing because no one wants to read about a normal guy struggling for his art. With no belief in himself he is on the cusp of giving up and selling out when he meets a girl who so wholeheartedly believes in him and his talent it makes him believe in himself. He is so inspired by her that he inserts her into his story instead this proves more popular and lo and behold he garners success and belief in himself and his writing. He also has to rescue the girl from her own personal demons and show her that his love for her will overcome anything. That's the movie I saw. To be honest that movie is not bad. I don't understand why it had to be squashed by this silly made up 'Girl can't choose between two guys' nonsense which isn't the movie the movie even tells you itself that it isn't the movie it never really tries that hard to convince you that you're watching a girl torn between two guys. I mean if you're trying to convince me that this girl is dating two great guys then maybe make the other guy less of a cardboard cutout. Maybe give their relationship some personality maybe have him interact with at least one other person in Jesse's life. Now this is all excusable if you take it from the point of view that he isn't real. But if he isn't real then why bother? The misdirection feels pathetic  unconvincing and pointless. Hey Daryn Tufts why are you trying to convince I'm watching a different movie than I am actually watching? It feels like a someone was trying and failing to trick me that just makes the actual story the one that was trying to be told redundant because now none of it means anything and I just wasted an hour and twenty minutes rolling my eyes. I gave the film a four because despite the terrible script and story the performances weren't bad given what they had to work with. Christopher Gorham is charming as hell and Alyssa Milano brings a sweetness to Jesse though I find her performance a little flat. Tom Lenk's little storyline is actually quite funny and he is amusing in it. Everybody else is kinda nondescript and their roles really could have been played by anybody such is their lack of anything resembling character or personality. I feel the most sorry for Michael Landes but eh never rated him much anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off let me clarify that I LOVE Alyssa Milano and the genre of romantic comedies in general. I am a huge sap when it comes to these types of movies even if they are all about the same thing. My Girlfriend's Boyfriend is no exception. It has the formulaic boy meets girl and they fall in love. However this story has a few twists along the way.As one user already pointed out the advertising is a little false. It DOES accurately portray the movie in one sense the first hour or so is the movie advertised because in the end the truth is revealed. That bugged me a little and is probably the reason I gave it 9 out of 10 stars instead of the 10 I wanted to give it. But I am jumping ahead. On with the review! Plot A downonhisluck writer Ethan meets the girl of his dreams Jesse in a caf where she works. They hit it off. After he leaves with her number in walks the stereotypical perfect guy Troy a hotshot in the advertising business. Troy also walks out of the caf with Jesse's number. Obviously shenanigans ensue. Jesse is dating two men at the same time without the other one knowing. Of course at this point the viewer assumes that eventually the two boyfriends will meet or some such thing. However what really happens is strangely more interesting.Spoiler While Jesse is dating both Ethan and Troy the viewer gets a sense that the two relationships parallel each other. Maybe 30 or so minutes in give or take I got the sense that maybe just maybe one of the boyfriends was like a fake...it was all made up...just like the scene at the beginning. Then I was like Nah that can't be it. This is a story about a woman who dates to guys. One of them can't be fake. So I watched the movie with that mindset. Sure some scenes did drag on a little too long. And I for one found the sidestory with Jesse's brother a little irritating. Yes it was funny...at first but then it became a little overdone.Anyway at the end of the movie Jesse is supposedly leaving with Troy after dumping Ethan. Ethan then runs to go find Jesse at the airport mirroring the first scene of the movie. THEN it is revealed that my original assumption was correct. However it's not as neat as that. Jesse has been keeping a secret...Overall I thought it was an enjoyable movie and I feel that my love for Alyssa doesn't even factor into that. It was a wonderful flick to just sit back and watch. It was clich but it was also witty. It was cute and funny. It was a happy story and I loved watching it.".

It isn't every day one gets to watch a wholesome film that's not attempting to inject some message about how one should live their lives and you should do it from the film's perspective. That's a problem with a lot of family films. This film doesn't do that in my opinion and for a film lover as myself that's always a good thing.I also know the aspect of trying to attempt to tell the person you're in a serious relationship with that you can't have kids physically. Being a man I found it became more difficult the older I got. When younger it just was a line I used with girls Can't get you pregnant but getting older that line fizzled away because girls I was serious with wanted to have children with me. Adoption is an option but a difficult or easy one based on where you live and what your position in society is just the way it is. In the society I live in I'm more on the spectrum of difficult and those who get into relationships with me know this from my and their pointofview. So I've been a bachelor my entire life. I have relationships on occasion but never gone further because when they find out I can't have kids of my own they're gone. I'm never enough. So I understand the pointofview of the character Jesse. This isn't a great film. It's an average film but an average film with the right kind of heart and that's always good.".

In the society I live in I'm more on the spectrum of difficult and those who get into relationships with me know this from my and their pointofview. So I've been a bachelor my entire life. I have relationships on occasion but never gone further because when they find out I can't have kids of my own they're gone. I'm never enough. So I understand the pointofview of the character Jesse. This isn't a great film. It's an average film but an average film with the right kind of heart and that's always good.";

It is important to remember that at the time of this film only Gance screenplay was an international legend. Moreau is fine as Marguerite de Valois  Franoise Rosay as Catherine de Medicis does a good job of chewing up the scenery. The '54 style potrayal of Henri d'Anjou as a very effeminate homosexual has been proven to be historically inaccurate but Daniel Ceccaldi is amusing in the part. The acting for Charles IX De la Mole Coconnas et al is up to '54 par acceptable and not terribly detracting from the story.The inevitable discussion will be around comparing the two version '54  '94. Chereau lifted entire sections of the screenplay from 1954 and didn't do a bad job with them for all that. A more faithful adaptation of the Dumas pre novel the '54 version cannot really be said to be a better movie. It is more French to be sure and less sensationalized but it too drags in spots just as the '94 does. The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre IS depicted but not in an overlong and blooddrenched manner.Moreau is rather cool as Marguerite whereas Adjani is overwrought in the '94 but both actresses give fine performances each in their own manner.This '54 version is a movie for an older generation perhaps more academic in its approach whereas the '94 is for a younger generation who like more zap and pizzazz in their cinematic representations.".

As a young American filmgoer I had never seen female nudity on the screen. Earlier in the film Jeanne Moreau as Queen Margot wears a seethrough chemise where one's voyeuristic sense was aroused by the sight of her nipples et al. In comparison American historical films were sanitized and the McCarthyite atmosphere of the time would have not allowed such a film to be shown on American soil.

It's just another prison comedy with a small twist. The incarcerated main character has 6 months to prepare for doin' time.It's nice to see Carradine pop up here and there parodying his other kung fu related works and this time sending an antismoking message while consuming a life time supply of cigarettes. All through the movie I kept trying to remember where do I know the actress that plays Rob's wife from. Then it hit me. None other than Jennifer Morrison of House M.D.. She looked hot in this movie but I feel she should make better choices in the future.All in all a decent comedy a better than expected but shaky direction from Schneider. This should be perfect for a weekend afternoon once it comes out on DVD.".

It seems that Rob Schneider has matured. He tackles serious subjects prison system in a fun way. Some of the jokes have been done to death and can be tiresome. But because of Schneider's performance they still are acceptable. Of course you don't have to expect this movie to have any social or political impact. I just want to mention that it is big step up for Schneider in comparison to The Animal or Deuce Bigalow. David Carradine clearly has gotten very old but still can deliver. Especially in this movie. Since he is parodying himself. He is making fun of the character he played in Kung Fu but at the same time embracing and honouring the role that brought him fame. Worth watching!".

So once upon a time there lived a tiny insecure man named Stan Schneider  along with her wife Jennifer Morison who learned the only way he could make his enormous ego feel comfortable in his teeny tiny body was to embarrass humiliate and torture others. He thought he was a master of disguise fooling others into believing he was a big man. So Stan is being sent to prison for fraud and the prospect terrifies him. As he fears he would be raped by the gay prisonmates. Seeking help from a mysterious martial arts guru known only as The Master Carradine Stan transforms himself into a Kung Fu expert ultimately bringing the warring prison gangs together and establishing peace within its walls. The movie changes its path in the second half  you will feel as if you are into a different movie. But that is not a backdrop of the movie it actually was the most interesting part. The second half deals with a comic prison story. Rob Schneider made the film very entertaining as the story is very interesting. He also makes you laugh always. He is superb. Morison was so sweet in the movie  you wish that you had a same kind of a wife. There are loads of funny moments the practice sessions the fights  changes in the prison it is so funny  lots more. A well made feel good comedy which would surely entertain you  make you laugh. Hilarious comedy by Schneider. Do watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "As you can probably guess from the summary i gave i hate this movie with a passion. This is the most disgusting horrible excuse for a movie i have ever seen. I had the misfortune of wasting 10 of my money as i went to see it at the cinema. So offended was i by the movie i walked out half way though it and i have never walked out of movie until i watched this. The jokes in this movie if they can be called that are the opposite of funny. The storyline is so utterly ridiculous and absurd it just gets stupider by the minute. The themes in the movie were so very offensive from the fight scenes in the prison to the main character fearing getting raped in prison. I should have known from the first 5 minutes of the movie it was going to be a crap movie. When he tells the old lady that she should fear getting raped by black men i should have walked out at that moment. I don't want to write anymore about this crap movie. I am so ashamed to have wasted my money on this piece of horse manure called Big Stan. I have absolutely no idea how so many people can find this movie funny. This movie is so typical of the long list of trashy movies that Hollywood is making. If anyone reads this please heed my advice and avoid this movie like the plague. this movie has single handedly put me off going to the cinema forever and i will not be watching anymore of Rob Schnider's aka MR can't act can't direct isn't funny films again as long as i'm alive and breathing.".

	onyx:emotionText "As you can probably guess from the summary i gave i hate this movie with a passion. This is the most disgusting horrible excuse for a movie i have ever seen. I had the misfortune of wasting 10 of my money as i went to see it at the cinema. So offended was i by the movie i walked out half way though it and i have never walked out of movie until i watched this. The jokes in this movie if they can be called that are the opposite of funny. The storyline is so utterly ridiculous and absurd it just gets stupider by the minute. The themes in the movie were so very offensive from the fight scenes in the prison to the main character fearing getting raped in prison. I should have known from the first 5 minutes of the movie it was going to be a crap movie. When he tells the old lady that she should fear getting raped by black men i should have walked out at that moment. I don't want to write anymore about this crap movie.

Rob Schneider plays a character that initially you're not sure whether to like him or hate him but the fact that the character is a wimp is his redeeming quality. I'm sure as the director Mr. Schneider played a big part in casting and his taste in beautiful women sure fared him well on this film. The role of the wife is played by a beautiful actress that's both witty and cleverly naive. I can honestly say I was entertained throughout. There were a few scenes that had me laughing out loud.

	schema:headline " I'm going to stand by my word. Big Stan was a very cringleinducing comedy.";
	schema:reviewBody "However I can't say I hate this prison comedy directed and produced by Rob Schneider who also starred in the film. It was more like a mixed bag for me. There were some parts that was honestly quite funny and entertaining. Yet there were a lot of moments in the film that wasn't. Written by Josh Lieb the film tells the story of a real estate con artist named Stan Minton Rob Schneider who panics when he learns that he is going to prison for fraud. Fearing that he might be rape by the other inmates he trained himself in the martial arts in order to survive only to find out that it's the people that run the big house that he needs to watch out for. Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say I personally didn't find the jokes too offensive but I did find the film badly written. First off the movie does overuse the 'male penetration' joke way too much that it become tiresome. Jokes about it are recycle throughout the film. It's annoying how often they bring it up. Honestly the movie would had been a lot funnier if he thought he would had been rape by these ruffians only to discover that the other inmates are civilize gentlemen who doesn't such things. It would make this movie stand out from other prison comedies. Something similar in the line of Rob Schneider's performance in 1993's 'Demolition Man'. Kinda like a fish out of water story. Just saying. Anyways we don't really see as the movie spent the first half parodying martial arts movies like 1984's 'Karate Kid'. While it was cool to see Stan train with his mentor the Master David Carradine and become a badass. I just disappointed that it goes in a snail pace. It takes forever for Stan to get to the prison. It's clear from the first half that this prison comedy was really lacking in direction. The second half of the movie is way different from the first half with the evil warden subplot. It's seems like two different movies. Not only does it seem come out of nowhere but the warden's action is so clichs. Can't we have a prison movie with a good warden for once!? Because of this I felt like I was watching badly made comedy version of 1994's 'Shawshank Redemption' and 1967's 'Cool Hand Luke'. Yet I do have to say I like the appearance of actor Scott Wilson. He's one of the best things about this movie. He's always great in showing seniority. However his character's plan doesn't make sense. Wouldn't inciting a riot be jail time!? Did he not think the prison board wouldn't do an investigation on it? Anyways I found the 'get rich' plan somewhat stupid. Still I have to say the supporting cast that make up the inmates were also very memorable. My favorite has to be Bob Sapp as Big Raymond and Henry Gibson as Shorts. Even if they playing onedimensional parody of characters we seem before. Nevertheless I really doubt in real life the enemies of Stan would be friends with him toward the end after trying to kill him in the beginning of the film. It seems a little too unrealistic. Still I did like how unlikeable Stan had a moral character arch in the film. It really did help make this movie somewhat watchable because I really couldn't stand him in the beginning. Also it's nice to see Rob Schneider put some effect in learning some Martial Arts moves and doing most of his own stunts. It's also nice to see David Carradine pop up here and there parodying his other KungFu related works. I just wish there was more of a reason on why he was helping Stan. His character seem to come a bit out of nowhere. Other characters like M. Emmett Walsh as Stan's corrupt lawyer Lew Popper and Jennifer Morrison as Stan's wife Mindy was equally as fun to be with. Plus the movie has a cameo of Rob's best friend Adam Sandler that most people who watch the film wouldn't probably notice unless they saw his name on the credits. It's a small Easter egg. Overall The offensive dark humor meanspirit jokes crude sexual innuendo racism and lewd language might turn some viewers away but for me it was meh. I saw worst in similar plots like 2016's 'Get Hard'. Still I really can't recommended watching as the movie is highly pointless and stupid. It's no 2002's '25th hours'. Take this review as get out of jail free card and bypass watching this film.".

I am sure it will do really well on DVD rentals and sales really funny stuff the Carridine fella is funnier than I ever imagined he could be as a parody of himself. The first half of this movie was the better half and this was due in great part to the training scenes he is in.Praises made this film has a very great deal of porn jokes and by porn I mean rape. I do not find this movie to be offensive but it seems to stick with the rape subject from beginning to end. And that for a lighthearted comedy movie is not very appropriate. Taking this matter apart I give this comedy 45 cause it certainly is one of the funniest movies of 2007.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only other movie I remember vividly with the protagonist fearing his upcoming time spent in jail was in Spike Lee's powerful drama 25th Hour where we follow Edward Norton's character in his final day of freedom before being sent to the slammer. In Big Stan Rob Schneider's crooked timeshare conman Stan got arrested in the opening minutes for fraud and you might think it's for racism and spends much of the first act mulling over the fear of getting raped in jail for not being part of any gang and a first timer wussy who's easy target for the lonely tough guys behind bars.Thanks to his crooked lawyer Lew Popper M. Emmet Walsh and the crooked system from the judiciary right down to the prison warden who as the movie states are always made to look like dicks anyway he gets six months off before he has to present himself to the courts to begin his sentence in in this period of time tries his best to look undesirable. Help comes in the form of The Master played to good campy effect by David Carradine star of the 70s Kung Fu series whom I last saw in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies playing well yet another stereotyped kung fu master.Thus begins the tried and very tired formula of the kooky training regime with strange food and diet coupled with near impossible feats like tittyweight training. Granted there were some genuine sight gags but sad to say they all get confined to this particular sequence. The trailer would have already spelt it all out for you and suffice to say that the best bits were already inside. The story by Josh Lieb seemed to have run out of steam even before the midway mark where Stan had already entered the jailhouse and asserted his tougher than tough no nonsense keep away demeanour by punching the lights out of the meanest rapist in jail and a few others.If you're looking for end to end laughter then you're likely to be bored once Stan becomes head honcho in getting some respect in jail. With that out of the way the movie degenerated into series of clichs and the usual nasty warden with nasty plan routines. It didn't help that supporting characters here were stereotyped into playing stereotypes conveniently split into the different cliques and clans.Directed by Rob Schneider himself his films to date has somewhat been of a hit and miss for me. Lending his prowess to supporting roles like in You Don't Mess With The Zohan and Click I thought he usually fared better in those unlike having to carry the movie solely on his own ala Deuce Bigelow and The Benchwarmers. What I found out unfortunately is that they usually start off strongly with quite a unique premise ripe for the cracking of some insane jokes before fizzling out halfway and coasts through some predictable drama to the finale.Still some laughs are better than none at all so if you really feel that you need some light hearted medicine then you'll find some joy in the beginning but that's all.".

Here at his second feature film ripe after a four years hiatus he makes the wait wellworthed with a cunning cinematographic experience that literally plunges the viewer into the wonderful world of film.Using the animation medium to push storytelling in film to new levels of effectiveness Kon tells the story of a legendary actress who's life and career sparks the interest of documentary director Genya Tachibana.  Along with his trusted cameraman he undertakes to interview the now very old Chiyoko Fujiwara spotlight actress in her hay days and together they delve into her past.This session blooms into a captivating narrative blending elements of her life with roles in some of her films and exploring her great search for love.  The movie thus explores the personal challenges and selfrealization that one undergoes through the different stages of life.  It does so with the help of probing questions from Genya and is not shy of being epic in scale passing seamlessly through fictional eras and time periods superimposing characters persons and life teachings.  The fusion of reality and fiction is truly remarkable and Satoshi Kon distinguishes himself from conventional dogmas in that aspect.  For him sky is the limit.  He is only limited by his boundless imagination.  The result is something fresh and spectacular.  From the beauty of the vibrant images to the backdrop of lyricism and poetry the movie explores life with us... and comes up with interesting conclusions.  You will have to see and judge for yourself but I promise that if nothing else it will have made you think.I was privileged to attend the world premiere at the Montreal FantAsia Festival and was greatly honored to be blessed with the incarnation of the director himself in flesh and bone.  He strikes me as a very intelligent very mature and wise man.  There is an old woman in the film who says to Chiyoko I love you and I hate you more than you can imagine.  I asked him the significance of that and he simply answered I do not really know what it means.  I know that I understand many things that I did not 15 years ago. I just tried to project myself in the future and thought of what I might be able to bestow to a younger inexperienced person like myself with this increased wisdom that comes with life's trials and tribulations.  I admit I am paraphrasing just a little my japanese is not that good in any case but that's essentially what he said and this confirmed my belief based on the artistic genius and masterful integration of complex thoughts into a simple flowing living piece that this man is gifted.

	schema:reviewBody "Chiyoko Fujiwara even her names evokes 1000 years of Japanese history beginning with the Fujiwara clan who dominated Japan a millennium ago as she dominated Japanese movies. The story begins with an elderly actress who recounts her life and career to a Quixotically worshipful producer and his Sancho Panzalike cameraman. Film juxtaposes with reality and the triumphs and tragedies of one actress meld into those of Japan itself objectivity and fantasy mock each other and dance with one another. At one moment the cameraman is making a pungent comment about cornball emotions and the next moment he is dodging burning arrows from one of her movies. Perhaps Chiyoko really is a woman cursed or perhaps blessed to endure 1000 years of unrequited love. Perhaps the mysterious humanrights activist that she pursues through the centuries and through one movie after another represents an everreceding ideal of love truth and human dignity that is yearned for by individuals and nations alike. They met just briefly he gave her the key to the most important thing in the world and Chiyoko and the film characters she plays spend the next 1000 years and the rest of her film career and the rest of her life trying to return it.Millennium Actress and the techniques of animation were made for each other. Liveaction could not possibly have created this stunning plunge though the centuries nearly as well nor have depicted the transformation of a beautiful young women into a beautiful old woman. Socalled liveaction movies would have buried a live actress under layers of Yodalike plastic to achieve the same effect.Presumably you will be watching this on DVD after you have watched this movie through once or twice go back and select scene 12 and just watch that it begins with an apprentice Geisha as played by Chiyoko risking everything to pursue the humanrights activist in this generation he is a rebel Samurai. A merciless Javertlike pursuer barges in to ruin everything but a Quixotic stranger rescues her for sake of idealistic love and sets her free to ride through the land of Japan to continue her search. She rides through Hokusai landscapes and through the battles of 19thCentury Japan. She continues undaunted even though the wheel of her curse keeps turning and is symbolized by increasingly modern modes of transportation carriages trains bicycles the splendor and tragedy of Japanese history whizzes by and still her journey continues. Her eternal quest for freedom turns into a freedom in itself and  by the way  the medium of animation gives a mighty leap from the Saturdaymorning ghetto to which American imaginations has confined it and shows off freedoms that liveaction could never do as well.This movie is actionfilled but never manic emotional but never overwrought thoughtprovoking but never airy. The unpleasant little word Surrealism comes to mind  it's unpleasant because it often evokes elitism selfindulgence and confusion. But Millennium Actress is never neurotic never smug and always invites the audience to join in the fun of mixing up film memory history and desire in surprising ways. There are enough delightful coincidences and plot twists to entrance an admirer of Shakespeare or Dickens. The musical score is excellent. The quality of animation is excellent and these characters have more originality life individuality and heart than in many movies being made in Hollywood.After you have checked this out look into Satoshi Kon's most recent movie Tokyo Godfathers. Then investigate the movies of Hayao Miyazaki who is the world's greatest maker of animated films and also Miyazaki's fellow geniuses of Studio Ghibli. 910".

She continues undaunted even though the wheel of her curse keeps turning and is symbolized by increasingly modern modes of transportation carriages trains bicycles the splendor and tragedy of Japanese history whizzes by and still her journey continues. Her eternal quest for freedom turns into a freedom in itself and  by the way  the medium of animation gives a mighty leap from the Saturdaymorning ghetto to which American imaginations has confined it and shows off freedoms that liveaction could never do as well.This movie is actionfilled but never manic emotional but never overwrought thoughtprovoking but never airy. The unpleasant little word Surrealism comes to mind  it's unpleasant because it often evokes elitism selfindulgence and confusion. But Millennium Actress is never neurotic never smug and always invites the audience to join in the fun of mixing up film memory history and desire in surprising ways. There are enough delightful coincidences and plot twists to entrance an admirer of Shakespeare or Dickens. The musical score is excellent. The quality of animation is excellent and these characters have more originality life individuality and heart than in many movies being made in Hollywood.After you have checked this out look into Satoshi Kon's most recent movie Tokyo Godfathers. Then investigate the movies of Hayao Miyazaki who is the world's greatest maker of animated films and also Miyazaki's fellow geniuses of Studio Ghibli. 910";

	schema:reviewBody "In some films the dividing line between subjective and objective reality is very tenuous. In Satoshi Kon's poetic Japanese anim film Millennium Actress it is almost nonexistent. When the Ginei studio is about to be razed documentarian Genya Tachibana decides to make a documentary about the studio and its greatest star legendary actress Fujiwara Chiyoko who disappeared from public life more than thirty years ago. After finding an old key that belonged to the aging actress he travels to her secluded mountain retreat with his assistant Kyogi Ida to interview her for the documentary. When Genya gives her the key it unlocks a stream of memories that transports us along with the cameraman and interviewer to a different reality that allows us to relive one thousand years of Japanese history using the medium of cinema. As she tells her story Chiyoko recounts her birth at the time of the great Kanto earthquake of 1923 and how she was discovered as a child actress despite her mother's objection that she is too timid. She reveals how a strange young painter a political outcast whose name she never discovers gives her a key and then disappears telling her that the key is the most important thing there is. Chiyoko's dream of reuniting with her lover keeps her alive and becomes what her life is about. Unfolding more as emotion and mood than narrative Kon takes us on a surreal journey through a series of films within films in which Chiyoko attempts to find her lost love playing a princess a ninja a geisha and even an astronaut. In the process we witness a seamless tableau of Japan's history the medieval period in the 15th and 16th centuries the era when the Shogunate was in power the Meiji period when the Emperor was restored the Showa period before World War II and the postwar occupation and recovery. The line between events of Chiyoko's real life and scenes from her films is blurred and the film is difficult to follow on first viewing. To complicate matters even further the interviewer Genya is cast in many roles in which he becomes almost a comic figure as Chiyoko's rescuer. Though the film is often puzzling the search to recapture the defining moment in Chiyoko's life strikes a universal chord and we identify with her desperate quest. Though I found the ending somewhat unsatisfying Millennium Actress is a complex and beautiful film and Susumu Hirasawa's hypnotic musical score adds to the blend of warmth emotional power and magical realism. Kon sees life as a big romantic movie full of melodrama humor and longing and seems to be saying that while there is often confusion between who we really are and the shifting roles we play in life what remains constant is our longing for love.".

The current executive in charge gets an interview with the studio's star actress whom has been living in seclusion for years and does not give interviews. The movie seamlessly integrates dramatic moments with light humor and stunning visuals. The visuals are breathtakingly imaginative not in that they are exotic and surreal but rather stunningly realistic. Where Perfect Blue is more about the dark side of human nature this movie is about the resilience of the human spirit and hope. What is similar is that the reality of the story is in question.

On interviewing her Genya presents her with an object she had lost long ago a key. From there we are transported through time and see Chyoko story about lost love and her struggle to find it. The key belonged to a man she meet when she was young. He was a rebel on the run and Chiyoko gave him shelter. He gave her the key as a thankyou. When he disappears she sets out to find this man. Still young Chiyoko is approached by a film maker to star in his new film she accepts and sees this as a chance to find mysterious man. She become a huge success but she is always empty never finding the man she loves.Satoshi Kon has created a wonderful film about the lose of love and the extraordinary lengths one woman will go to find it. What makes this an interesting watch is that when we go into Chiyoko's past Genya and his camera man also walk around in her past interacting with people. But its just not a trek through her past her memories meld with the movies she has made as the movies parallel her life on her journey of finding her love but also time in history. The scenes we see are from the movies she has made but the story is her own life her reality and her imagination have just crashed into one another.The animation here is just visually amazing. Satoshi Kon's character designs are so unique they set themselves apart from another animations. All the backgrounds are so detailed and textured. What i find great is that Satoshi Kon adds that tiny bit of surrealism adding more dimension and thought here its how Chiyoko's memories meld into the movies she's starred in. Satoshi's script is so deep and full of angst. Its hard to watch this woman on her quest for love always failing yet she blindly keeps going no matter what.At great movie about the journey of love and how its never ending in this world and the next.".

It seems to be in the more realistic spectrum with fewer edges and less posturing.Japanese writing has gravity. In traditional mode the eye falls down as it gathers a phrase. The characters are derived from ink on paper instead of the western fonts shaped by chisel on stone.

A Japanese reader will literally harvest phases by falling through images images in a static situation with dynamic sweeps therein.So when I come to anime I look for this. Being nonJapanese I can see it and appreciate it more than a native can I believe.That's why I'm excited about this because the visual phrases are imposed on some folds I know. First about the folds. The way this is structured is as a double documentary of an aged film star Sunset Blvdwise. Its double because we have a camera and we are seeing the two documentarians one the interviewer and the other with a camera. We never get a view through that camera I think.The interview blends with the actress's flashbacks. Now this is very clever how this is done.It isn't memory the documentarians are physically there when a past episode occurs. The cameraman constantly asks what next? and the interviewer takes on the role of certain characters in the films. These really are films we see when sometimes the camera rolls back and we see the crew. This is a third camera.But more all of the films over many decades conflate and merge interweaving back and forth through history forming a single quest for a love. That love is for a painter who clearly is the animator of this cartoon Duck Amuckwise. These films not only merge with each other and the quest and the interview but with her life proper.As with 8 12 Women earthquakes figure in the shifts and overlays of stories. The thing that binds it all is a key which we learn early is to a paintbox the source of all the paintings we see. Its wonderful organic oneiric origama. oneiroticama.And that's just the story.

	schema:reviewBody "Reprising roles that span a millennium an actress who longs for her first love reenacts the drama of affirming her love for him. 'Millennium Actress' puts the theme of unrequited love in a light that is universally encompassing. It is ultimately a story of a purehearted character whose loving devotion to one person innocently conceived and passionately guarded lends itself sentience and weaves fiction with stark reality of often longing and despair. There is no doubt that this film has left me profoundly impressed. 'Millennium Actress' adopts an esoteric 'film within film' form that is disclosed in flashbacks by the actress Chiyoko. Her highlights of her cinematography is interwoven with real events of her life and both fiction and nonfiction aspects of her life adhere to the context of concise Japanese history. Some of these flashbacks at least in their thematic references recur more than once and variations between them become clever plot devices that lend meaningful depth of time and space to the film.The recurring and consistently relevant symbols in the flashbacks not only pique the viewer's interest but also anchor a means to explain the psyche of Chiyoko. Her reaction in each flashback and present to one particular entity is another indication of her perspective on her love one of many signs of deep implication that enhances the film.The animation in the film tends to be minimalist except for a few instances where it is cast in significant passage of film for example running but the art direction and technique which realize various era of Japanese history and provides a fluid transition between fictional flashbacks to accounts rooted in reality is most elegantly and superbly executed. Character design is accordingly appealing especially the depiction of Chiyoko through various stages of her life that delineates the same dignity and purity. So much so that it seems almost as if Chiyoko itself transcends to some abstract form of ideal love only unrequited and therefore something of great potential but not wasted since it essentially defies time and space as allegorically portrayed in her various film roles.The director Satoshi Kon commented in his interview on his pleasure with the music which seems to be electronically assembled with a lot of repetition. It sometimes stands out as a bit overbearing and idiosyncratic yet considering the nature of theme from the film it does not detract from the overall viewing experience. Only note of letdown if there is any point to it at all comes from my personal disdain for a rather melancholy sequence at the end. Yet a conventional Hollywood resolution would not apply here. As a footnote to my rambling and for which I must apologize I should add that 'till death do us part' could not be more opposite of what this film professes.910".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a remarkable film beautiful and heartbreaking.Millennium Actress's style is strange but it works. It is a love story through and through and a wonderful one at that. Using a remarkably original and engrossing form of storytelling the memories of the main character Chiyoko Fujiwara are portrayed through her films as her career life and memories memories that may or may not be as they seem blend into cornucopia of sights and story. We are guided through this woman's life her career as a movie star her feud with jealous older actress her marriage to a scheming director.... and her desperate search for her love. As a girl she meets and falls in love with a mysterious painter a fugitive known only as The Man of the Key. Her memory of this one meeting and her love for him are the heart of the film. Note how little we know or see of the painter though. It plays perfectly with how this film tells its story and how it portrays Chiyoko's memories. I don't want to reveal exactly HOW it works here since that would involve spoilers. But nothing is left unanswered in this film and it never lets up its pace. It's best just to sit back and let the film tell its story.It all comes to an ending that is heartbreaking yet uplifting and totally satisfying. This is easily one of the best films of 2003.Don't let those who call it overrated deter you from seeing this film. See it and make your own mind up. You might just see why it has its well deserved 8.1 rating.P.S. Pay attention to the music. It's fantastic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some Minor Spoilers Satoshi Kon's sophomore piece Sennen Joyuu aka Millennium Actress is a decent anime animated feature that is a visual wonder.  Like his previous feature Perfect Blue Kon succeeds in transcending the boundaries of Japanese Animation to bring a love story that doesn't follow the typical norm of Japanese Anime guns robots and tentacles.  Millenium Actress follows the life of Chiyoko a cute girl with a mole through the turbulent history of Japan from the Age of the Samurai through the Feudal Wars to the Tokugawa Age of Foreign Influence up through the Japanese invasion of Manchuria into the World War II Tokyo bombings and beyond. Taking its cue from Forrest Gump 1994 Chiyoko an aspiring actress continually finds her life intertwined with the various time periods as she pursues the love of her life a mysterious artist. Told through the eyes of a Producer documenting the life story of Chiyoko through her films and roles Kon plays tribute to various Japanese film genres during the course of this feature.  From the Samurai epics of Akira Kurosawa to the sappy melodramas of producer Haruki Kadokawa to even the giant monster mayhem of Inoshiro Honda Millennium Actress covers it all. Unfortunately the story becomes a bit tiring after a while and the time jumping' from decade to decade becomes a bit confusing one minute we are in Manchuria in the 1930's and then we're transported back in time to Feudal Japan with scarcely an explanation.  The love story aspect of the story is touching if a bit melodramatic as we are never really given any explanation of why Chiyoko is so enamored by the tall stranger she meets as a girl. There are funny bits of comedy that break up the somber mood however and the inventive animation will recall similar techniques used in the British Animation Feature Yellow Submarine 1968 mixing animation with semirealistic photos.  All in all Kon succeed in breaking the stereotypical impressions of Japanese Animation and like fellow contemporaries Otomo Katsuhiro Akira and Hayao Miyazaki Spirited Away are introducing a whole new generation of Western Audiences to Anime.".

	schema:headline " An Amalgam of SelfReference SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "Satoshi Kon's latest film Millennium Actress is even more of a pleasure to watch than his first film Perfect Blue not only from a narrative perspective but also from a self referential one.  The film focuses on an actress and an obsessed director that is making a documentary on her life in movies.  The selfreference begins here the actress is based on an actual person and the director in the movie is none other than Satoshi Kon himself extrapolated only in his exaggerated emotions.A review of the movie elsewhere likened the movie to James Cameron's Titanic in the sense that the viewer experiences the main portion of the story through the old woman's flashbacks.  While this is accurate Millennium Actress works on several more levels by diverging from Titanic's structure in several ways the first of which being the way the director and his cameraman interact with her memories.  Both are not specters of observation unable to affect the environment as in conventional flashback movies. The director so obsessed with the actress tries to save her from peril in various scenarios.  The cameraman as a character is not necessary for the narrative he merely exists as a constant reminder that we are viewing a movie.  Whenever the movie lapses' into what may be a genuine dramatic scene the illusion is stripped away to reveal set actors and crew.  In many scenes the probing voyeuristic eye of the portable camera upends the drama.  We wonder exactly what the camera is capturing if anything at all.The beginning of the movie shows one of the final scenes.  As a viewer we have no reference point and it seems like the picture will have a science fiction setting.  This is denied when the camera pulls back to an editing room where the director is watching the film.  He lets the tape rewind and we are treated to a rapid look at the rest of the film that gives a sense of dj vu when the scenes are watched in forward motion.The actress is versatile in her roles performing in various period pieces that pay tribute to Eastern history and cinema.  In the narrative outside of her acting career she is desperately trying to locate a lover to return a key he has given her.  A recurring character with a scar on his face reappears in various periods in a state of perpetual hunt for the young man.  Her movie life enlarges the struggle every scene relates to finding him before the man with the scar does.  Since we are viewing the memories of unrequited love from the old woman's perspective the magnitude of the passion is most likely heightened.  To the woman the memories could be much more powerful than the actual encounter.  The encounter is a very short scene with no real motive for the love it is love in its purest form not necessary for explaining by the film.  It is a raw emotional sensation that will be unachievable when the director is finished with his documentary.The pacing of the film never slows in usual Western fare the second act's forward motion is broken by a period of low action before final rising action to the climax. Millennium Actress surpasses this with an unending slew of scenes that serve to pull the viewer deeper into the cinematic experience as our interest is traditionally waning in other films.  The climax consists of fast matchedcut edits as the narrative comes to its cohesive ending.  This film has renewed my faith in cinema.".

Kon never lets the limitations of reality interfere with his imagination and creativity. He is a consistent example of how anime can create a work of art that can't be shown through liveaction films.The Millennium Actress follows Genya with his camera man Ida as they interview Chiyoko and learn the life story of the actress who has since retired and secluded herself in bamboo forests and hills. The film does an amazing job of telling Chiyoko's story through the various movies she made throughout her life and showing the idea of forever chasing your dreams.The storytelling method by Satoshi Kon where he puts Genya and Ida into the depiction of Chiyoko's past and movies is fascinating and undoubtedly effective. Genya and Ida are like ghosts from the future looking into Chiyoko's life as she chases after the man she loves. It was refreshing to see the two interact physically and emotionally with the past world in order to shoot Chiyoko's story as well as helping her bring the movies to life. The editing as expected from Satoshi Kon is phenomenal. The transitioning between Chiyoko's stories and her movies are beautifully done. The movies and characters all have recurring themes as the stories shift genre backgrounds and time periods. The constantly changing settings and stories seem to reflect Chiyoko's feelings at a particular time in her life. The depictions of Japan's historical eras all the way to the Space Age are not only well designed but they are never too long nor too short and they keep the viewers constantly engaged as they piece together Chiyoko's life story.As an aside I personally think that I've never seen someone direct and edit scenes of runningchasing better than Satoshi Kon.The soundtrack also helps to bring the animation to life and works in unison with the film to draw out emotions.Overall Millennium Actress is a touching story told in the most creative beautiful and elegant way. The film is sure to stay with you as you go through your own life chasing dreams.".

He litters her path with earthshattering events perpetually reducing her world to rubble.

There's more than enough complexity in the structure of the story. Simple sometimes stark lines and colors that echo the reality on screen combine with beautiful backgrounds to create a complex and elegant meditation on the power of dreams and images the need to forge them and the lifechanging impact of finding your own star to follow.".

	schema:reviewBody "Millennium Actress is a stunningly beautiful piece of animation.The movie begins by showing a pair of documentary makers an old interviewer and his younger cameraman who have been given the privilege of interviewing one of Japans biggest female moviestars ever Chiyoko Fujiwara about 30 years after she unexpectedly retired from filmmaking. As they start the interview they are shown the actress's story from two angles  her real life and the movies she has made. They are surprised in finding that those two don't differ as much as one might think.Following the celebrated actresses life is wonderful albeit a bit hard to follow on the first viewing. From Manchuria in the 1930's following her real life the movie suddenly jumps to feudal Japan and one of Chiyoko's movies in a completely different setting after that to another movie set in yet another era and a different genre. We are shown action drama science fiction and horror often without any narration where the real characters can explain what is really happening on and offstage as other movies have thought us to expect  this most likely leads to some or many viewers not really understanding that what we see in Chiyokos movies at the same time is her real life story in turn perhaps leading to a sense of unfulfilment. That Millennium Actress had no real story when it absolutely has and the story is a great one. Director Satoshi Kon plays with us using refined techniques from his previous movie Perfect Blue in binding the two lives of Chiyoko together and making us question what we are watching. Is it one of her movies or a scene from her real life? Once again Kon proves himself to be a one of the worlds best directors.Now if the two different perspectives doesn't make it complicated enough the interviewer and his camera man also get to join in on the fun  appearing in the memories and films of Chiyoko's life. While sometimes being just right as well as underlining the intimate knowledge the interviewer has of her films the comic relief they are supposed to yield at other times can distract from the scenes themselves. It's a small nitpick especially considering how they bring the audience closer to what's happening in the movie and really lifting those killer scenes.And speaking of scenes Millennium Actress has a ton of great ones. Beautiful scenes that will stay with you for a long time brought to life by exceptional animation  fully exploiting every advantage animation has over traditional cinema in creating an animated movie like no other. The animation is further complemented by Susumu Hirasawas wonderful music music that breathes of life and magnifically portrays the young actress's life as she progresses through life.With a wonderful story humane characters superb direction and beautiful animation Millennium Actress is one of those films that simply gets to you. And what more could you ask for?".

	schema:reviewBody "Great concept soso execution. An interviewer and his cameraman sit down to interview a longretired actress who's been shunning other reporters for years. The interviewer brings her a gift a key that she lost long long ago. It opens up her memories of a man whom she helped in her youth in the era before WWII and we see those memories entangled in her film career. These melded flashbacks are a beautiful idea. Unfortunately for some reason the interviewer and his cameraman come along for the trip filming the events inside the actress' head and eventually even participating in them. This conceit never works and in fact the film pretty much fails just because of it. It doesn't at all help that both of these characters are constantly used for unnecessary comic relief especially the cameraman whose reaction shots I'm guessing Satoshi Kon found hysterical as they're in there so frequently. If Kon had left these two characters out of the fantasy the film might have been great. Even so it still would have been far away from a masterpiece. The central story of the girl looking for her lost love through her memory is great but I didn't feel like I knew her well enough to care either way.".

There are 4 archetypes in the story a tall dark stranger a young naive wistful girl an older jealous woman and a caring brave 'nice guy' in the friend zone. These characters reappear over  over throughout her lives both past  future. The 4th archetype is reminiscent of Forest Gump. In the present she is an actress retelling her memories to a small documentary crew who are drawn into her past present and future lives. The scenes transition between eras of Japanese history artistically but abruptly and without logic or reason. Scenes also transition between eras and present movie sets without real rhyme or reason. This is similar to the style of Mr. Nobody. Some reviews said it could not be made live action but was done effectively with that movie. There are some questions in the movie that do not get answers. The story telling is very artistic and unique more so than Deadpool. I'm quite OK with artistic movies Princess Kaguya but the scene jumping was a bit too illogical and without motivation. I tend to prefer a bit more coherent stories. I also believe I gave Mr. Nobody a 7.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an Adrian Pasdar fan I checked out Streets of Gold. But the real star of the movie is Klaur Maria Brandauer who plays the main character Alek. Alek is a boxing pro who defected from Russia when they wouldn't let him compete on the Russian Olympic team because he was Jewish.Now Alek comes to live in New York although the racist and ethnic slurs haven't disappeared. He offers to coach two up and coming boxers Timmy Boyle Adrian Pasdar a young Italian kid and Roland Jenkins Wesley Snipes a young black man. One competitive opponents these two guys eventually become friends and with Alek's help they become good enough to fight for the U.S. Olympic team. The movie presents a meaningful story with a somewhat good view of boxing although the story supercedes the action in the ring. Written of course during the Cold War is a story of unity between a Russian and his acceptance and integration into the United States. On the other hand it also looks at racial and ethnic divisions not only as experienced by Jewish Alek but also by Timmy and Roland who are initially reluctant to make friends because of this hatred. The movie is only somewhat a good view of boxing although most of the movie just shows the young men and their coach involved in training sessions while the only real fights the stars engage in is their primitive fighting scenes in the beginning and the final boxing matches for the Olympic team.Klaus Maria Brandauer really steals the movie as Alek the coach who is never really sure if coming to America was a good idea until his ideals get to flourish through the success of his boxers hence the taglinethree visions two boxers one dream. Adrian Padar fans won't want to miss this one as well. And Wesley Snipes gives a good performance too as the cocky Roland Jenkins.".

	schema:headline " A fantastic 80s flavoured smack down";
	schema:reviewBody "This a great inspiring boxing film from the mid eighties. I had read a number of positive reviews about this film and I agree with those reviews.Alek a former boxer from the Soviet Union Klaus Maria Brandauer arrives in the United States to start a new life. He witnesses two boxers Timmy Adrian Pasdar and Roland Wesley Snipes participate in the rough sport of illegal boxing. The two young men have obvious strength with the arrogant attitudes to match and Alek sees that they both have potential to become champion boxers. After Timmy witnesses Alek get the better of Roland during a drunken dark alley brawl Timmy asks Alek to be his coach as he knows that his style could use some refining.Alek accepts and puts Timmy through a tough training regime. Timmy gets angry after his coach walks out in the middle of their first training session resulting in Timmy screaming four letter words at Alek a memorable scene. Afterwards when things have cooled down the young man feels contrite. A number of things happen one of them being the Soviet boxing team visiting the US for a post cold war smack down and Alek takes on Roland as a protg much to Timmy's chagrin since he and Roland had bad blood between them. Under Alek's wing the two kids learn discipline and excel at boxing. The entire film proceeds in a logical order culminating in a Rockystyle bout between Timmy and the Soviet champ.Streets of Gold features Pasdar and Snipes in their early twenties when they were unknowns and it's easy to see that way back then they had the talent and the masculine looks to achieve super stardom. The film is worth watching just to see Pasdar attempt to do a Russian folk dance. I have to give him points for trying! The veteran actor Brandauer is just as brilliant as the two young lead actors as the fiery yet Yodalike mentor.There are a few genuine laughoutloud moments in this film. I won't give anything away since you have to see them for yourself.I can't finish the review without mentioning the fashion. The 1980s had featured colourful clothes by today's standards and I must warn you that there is plenty of typical 80s fashion in this film as you'd expect. Baby Boomers and early Gen X's will feel nostalgic while watching this while late Gen X's and Gen Y's will be silently thankful that they didn't have to wear such outlandish clothing. I'm in Generation Y BTW.The only criticism that I can give as other reviews have discussed is that didn't explore the characters as deeply as I would have liked. For example we don't get an in depth look at Timmy and Roland's troubled childhoods. Perhaps a flashback could have been appropriate. However I'm just nitpicking since what has been presented in this 89 minute film is excellent.If you are a fan of Pasdar or Snipes or of boxing80s sports films Streets of Gold is a must see film. 8.510.".

At the funeral home she begins to take her fascination with death to the next level by becoming a necrophiliac. But she also begins her first ever relationship with Matt a medical student with who she is totally open about her necrophilia. He finds this aspect of her compelling.

I went away from this movie feeling like I had witnessed something important and special. It may be disturbing at times but Kissed is never revolting.

Gore blood guts and other stuff come from fear. There is no respect in that in my opinion. That is for people who are afraid of their own mortality. We are all going to die. It is beautiful that the director and writer were able to explore their relationship with death. Death is intriguing and dark because it is unknown. I think this movie really looked at the main character's relationship with death herself and her own mortality through her love for the dead. Only it was presented in a literal fashion. It seemed as though the plot was a great manifestation of the theme which may be our understanding of life death and rebirth. Yes sex is life and death is rebirth. And yes I find the idea of having sex with the dead literally repulsive working with the dead on a daily basis. I don't believe that was the message of the movie. One thing I learned in the funeral service is that it is life that we deal with day to day not death. It is helping the living deal with loss. That is love. If only there were more cerebral psychological and spiritual movies that touch this topic but unfortunately we are left with gore!! Anyone know of any other movies like this?".

What's next a feelgood movie about childmolestation? Or rape or incest??? HELLO  SHE'S HAVING SEX WITH CORPSES!!! This is worse than some crappy slasher movie because it's a horror movie in disguise wrapped in a pretty package but with a weak plot  thin character development why is she the way she is other than she's always been that way? And she meets some random guy  he's into it too? YEAH RIGHT!!!. I'm surprised that anyone would want to have anything to do with this project unless they wanted to commit careersuicide!

I expected him to be a little more horrified. I also didn't believe his outcome but I suppose it was always going to happen. Molly Parker was simply great and it was such a difficult role to pull off but she does it admirably. I really believed her and this world she ventured into. It manages to make a taboo subject seem quite fascinating which in itself is groundbreaking. I think it does stand true that if the sexes were switched then audiences would indeed have trouble swallowing the story but this way round it is more acceptable. Well that's the double standard thing again. Thought provoking and sensual. I take away from this Parker's performance more than anything without her I think the film would be consigned to the annals of history.".

If Lynne Stopkewich and Angus Fraser had made a movie glorifying pedophiles or serial rapists would people have praised it?! Probably not...or at least they wouldn't have done so publicly...after all these are nasty and illegal. So why then praise necrophilia?! It's illegal in most but not all places and really really gross...yet to some it's romantic or compelling?! Why not then make films about urophilics people who like to tinkle on others for gratification or copraphilics people who like to defecate on others for gratification?!

It's definitely not grotesque which makes me question it even more afterward. Obviously no actual dead bodies are used. So the gross factor isn't in the experience of watching the movie. It's in the dissecting of the movie after watching it. The younger Sandra is pretty interesting with her only friend. The older Sandra's romance with Matt is perplexing. The necrophilia is done with sexuality like a normal sex scene which ends in a bright light as she perceives the soul of the dead. Molly Parker is beautiful and compelling.

The director tried to create an intellectual drama ignoring the fact that it's plot could attract horror gore hounds.So the movie is not all a woman that enjoys having sex with corpses. There's a disturbing background behind the story.

Sandra gets naked and rides a corpse. While having sex some disturbing flashbacks come to her mind with classic ? music in the background. Was that scene meant to be disturbing? I found it uncomfortable because you can say the director tried to craft a classy and dramatical scene. The result is bad.The final scene where the boyfriend tries to show love to his girlfriend by hanging himself so she could make love to him the way she does to corpses. Our lead female Molly Parker lets him die and tells policemen that she didn't try to stop her boyfriend's attempt to suicide because she loved him or something. Then she tells a creepy monologue about how his love was intense and how her body wanted him. She tells a metaphor or how can love be life on extinction. Parker rests her head on Matt's chest and looks to the camera. Then the creepy song plays.What? So Sandra made a big deal of not having sex with Matt because he wasn't a corpse so she lets him commit suicide she didn't do anything to stop him and then she finds she loved him very much?!..........610. I love horror movies and I thought this could be one. The truth is that I sat through a very weird movie that I don't consider it as an art movie. I think of it as a movie with different intentions than the ones displayed... I'm talking about a regular drama. The best thing about the movie is Molly Parker's performance.

Cut to years later now a young woman she has become an avid necrophiliac hence wanting to get a job embalming the dead so she can secretly have sexintercourse with the corpses a few adult theme moments. This heavily brought to mind if identically The Neon Demon scene with Jena Malone. Outerbridge is incredibly accepting to a point trying to get around her new girlfriend's fetish where a streak of real jealousy from him pushes him on the brink. Kissed is a beautifully written and must see film with two great performances by actors of high calibre. It's an appropriately short the less is more approach wonderfully suiting. A short engrossing movie ride that we really don't want to get off. It's a masterpiece of film making you don't dare wanna touch.

	schema:headline " Nervewracking but still fascinating . . .";
	schema:reviewBody "To understand a person's fetish my guess is that you would have to share that fetish. Maybe that's why it's hard to get close to Sandra Larson the necrophiliac at the center of 'Kissed' a bold film by Canadian director Lynn Stopkewich. This was the film that caused a huge stink at the Toronto Film Festival only because it is about a necrophiliac.But Stopkewich walks a very fine line to avoid making the film exploitive or ridiculous. She could have made the worst film of the year but her frankness and restraint keep the viewer fascinated but not repelled.The center of the film is Sandra who from childhood has had a fascination with death. She describes one summer with her friend when they would find dead animals and have funerals for them. At nightfall she would perform the strange ritual of shrouding the body and then rubbing it on her skin which she calls 'anointing'.As a young woman played by Molly Parker working in a flower shop she is overjoyed when she is allowed to make a delivery to the local funeral home and soon she is working there. When she touches the bodies we don't sense a sick fascination but a passage a transcendence which she calls 'crossing over'. When she touches the bodies there is a heavenly light accompanied by an angelic chorus. This could have been done in very poor taste but we understand from the intensity in Parker's performance that there is something very serious going on something about setting them free 'Each of them has its own wisdom innocence happiness grief. I see it' While in college she meets a man who oddly enough is fascinated by what she is doing. 'Why would you want to be an embalmer?' he asks her on their first meeting. 'Because of the bodies I make love to them' she says without missing a beat. He is interested in her attraction but doesn't understand the emotional bond. He grows jealous of her attraction to the dead and is willing to do anything to gain her affections.The scenes in which she performs her rituals are done with extreme restraint. Stopkewich uses her camera to suggest what Sandra is doing but then pulls back so that he have only the idea. The movie is never interested in the mechanics of Sandra's sexuality but more in its spiritual nature.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yikes! and we all thought Joan Crawford was THE horror Mommy Dearest...well Laura Hope Crewes as Mom in this stinging 4 character film delivers and cops the goods in this cracker of a marital Mommy mangle.....THE SILVER CORD is a genuinely sensational pre code drama from RKO made in 1932 released in '33 from a 1929 play. So astonishing frank and honest is each startling verbal exchange between one son's wife IreneDunne along with the other's fianc as these two younger girls together go to war  gleefully angrily unwrapping the clearly incestuous hankerings of Mom towards her hunky eldest son played by virile Joel MacCrea and her younger 'beau'son payed by delicate and beautiful 25 year old actor Eric Linden. I would think this film played to many howling appreciative audiences in huge theaters in 1933 and offers viewers even in 2005 a very fruity melodrama enlivened by crackling dialog not afraid to call Mother exactly as she is. This film would have been impossible to make after the censorship code came in after 1934. Other viewer comments on the IMDb support my reaction and you will find almost everyone lucky enough to see and tape THE SILVER CORD will agree it is an unforgettable and pungent script in a superbly produced film. It would have played like the VIRGINIA WOLF of 1932. Laura Hope Crewes must have kissed the sound stage at RKO for this role of a lifetime..even more than her fluffy turn in GWTW. Irene Dunne is as gorgeous and casual and believable as ever fighting for her husband yet again and it is well worth seeing The Divorce made in 1929 as a companion piece to THE SILVER CORD. Joel MaCrea is certainly in the same league as Cary Grant and Randolph Scott in the handsome and lovable stakes. I had never seen Eric Linden in a real acting role before he played the leg amputee in the hospital horror scene in GWTW and here he is startling and youthful with an excellent role as Robert the younger and more sensitive son. Some verbal barbs leveled at him again would not get past the Code office if made later. This is a really good film and if the viewer forgives some of the creakiness of its time and settles in for a sparring match of unequaled pungency for a 1932 movie you will be well rewarded. At first I thought some of the throat clutching melodrama of Mother was dated until I realized it was a set up of the excellent screenplay to make the viewer laugh at her as though she is a weak little old lady......NOT..... but nor are the other two women in this powerhouse play on film hence the fantastic retort dialog. That oceanliner seen in reel one is THE LEVIATHAN the monster ship the US won from the Germans in WW1 that was so huge and unwieldy that crews were nervous wrecks trying to wrestle with it upon the Atlantic. It is infamous for ploughing headfirst up a colossal wave in a storm and shot over the crest at such an angle the spine along the bottom cracked and the ship split vertically between the funnels. It limped to port with rattling steel panels and winking rivet holes...and mentally shattered crew and passengers. It was scuttled in 1935 after being cursed and plagued with horror mechanical problems all its existence. Not such a war prize after all. Anyway the dialog in THE SILVER CORD is enough excitement for one night eg Mother! the Doctor said there was nothing wrong with you in fact he said it would take a stick of dynamite to kill you. Whammo!".

	schema:reviewBody "Terrific acting by the 5 stars makes this one a must see.Based on a stage play THE SILVER CORD is about mother love at its worst. The film was very controversial for its implied homosexuality of the younger son and the mother's unnatural romantic feelings for both sons.Irene Dunne stars as the new bride and biologist who travels with husband Joel McCrea to visit the family before heading off to New York City for their new jobs. But something seems wrong.The mother Laura Hope Crews seems rude to the younger son's Eric Linden fiance Frances Dee. But Dunne puts such thoughts aside and ignores a few of the strange things the mother says. Then she finds out her room is down the hall from McCrea's and his room adjoins mother's room.Later she walks in as mummy is tucking in McCrea and kissing him on the lips good night. Mummy has also been working on Linden and getting him to doubt his feelings for Dee. Everything blows up and with Dee running into the snowy night toward the frozen pond. As the boys run after her mummy shouts from the window for boys to come back and get their coats! Dee falls through the ice and is rescued.As the girls leave the house the following morning Dunne lets mummy know what she thinks of her and her attachment to the boys. But mummy has a tight hold faking illness and forever boasting of her sacrifices. The girls leave but the boys stay behind.......Crews is magnificent as the voracious mother repeating her stage role it's a part few actresses would dare play. The sexual overtones are incredible for a 1933 film and Crews take advantage of her best film role. Dunne is also excellent as she tries to maneuver the course without losing McCrea. Dee has some excellent scenes after she gets dumped by bewildered Linden. All 5 stars are terrific in this drama that is bizarrely underrated and unknown.A neglected gem for anyone who likes great acting......".

There's little time to spare before we get a good idea of why there is no father figure in the picture. At times the obsessive nature of Mom's voracious emotions toward her sons suggests an incestuous factor that only a precode film could feature.

Dee yanks the viewer around and drives you into her pain without even showing her face ! Frances Dee like Laura Hope Crews has been too long overlooked and is now almost forgotten as the magnificent actress that she was. No actress who started in film after WWII has had anything to speak of on Frances Dee.If you're lucky enough to see The Silver Cord which was never released for TV you'll find this old fashioned drawingroom drama to be an outstanding film that shows very well 74 years after its 1933 release because it is filled with superb performances.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE SILVER CORD RKO Radio 1933 directed by John Cromwell is a story about two sons Joel McCrea and Eric Linden whose widowed mother Laura Hope Crews tries to destroy their happiness with the women Irene Dunne and Frances Dee they love and marry. The movie adaptation taken from the 1929 stage play also directed by Cromwell starred Laura Hope Crews. While Dunne and McCrea have feature billing in the screen version it is Crews reprising her stage role who carries the story from start to finish. Inasmuch as it is a filmed staged play very talky with little action the story itself is never boring especially when it relies on the shock value of Crews' excessive selfishness that gives the plot some entertaining bite.THE SILVER CORD became the very first movie I got to see when American Movie Classics was added to the system by my local cable system. It fact up to that time it was rarely televised anywhere with the exception of its dubbed Spanish TV broadcast in the early 1970s on WNJU Channel 47 in Newark New Jersey. To date American Movie Classics was the last cable network to broadcast THE SILVER CORD with final air date being June 10 1994.As for Crews born November 13 1879 the actual star of this product resumed her movie career mostly in secondary character parts up to the time of her death December 12 1942. She never had a finer opportunity of screen than she did in THE SILVER CORD and never did again. With a small list of actors credited in the cast seen in a brief role is Gustav Von Seyffertitz the same nasty villain who terrorized Mary Pickford in the silent classic SPARROWS United Artists 1926. Overall highly recommended. 12".

With a small list of actors credited in the cast seen in a brief role is Gustav Von Seyffertitz the same nasty villain who terrorized Mary Pickford in the silent classic SPARROWS United Artists 1926. Overall highly recommended. 12";

	schema:reviewBody "Who won the best actress Oscar for 1933? It should have been Laura Hope Crewes for her magnificent portrayal of the most monstrous mother ever. She truly is one of the great character actresses of all time. She played the frivolous Prudence Duvernoy in Camille 1936 and her best remembered role is Aunt Pittypat in Gone With the Wind.Irene Dunne was the official star of the film but her scenes with Laura Hope Crewes were dynamite.David Joel McCrea is in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York. His wife Christine Irene Dunne can continue her studies at the Rockafellar Centre. Their first stop in America is a visit to David's mother Mrs. Phelps. To say that Laura Hope Crewes dominates every scene is an understatement. From her first entrance  in a frantic burst of effort to greet her big boy  all attention is on her. Even sitting around the tea table when she forgets Hester's existence even forgetting how she takes her tea you know something is not quite right.Hester has been living there for a while.Frances Dee is completely sweet and so right in her role as the adorable Hester. Her performance in this film especially the scene where she has hysterics and the aftermath proves how underrated as an actress she was.All the young cast are excellent. Eric Linden is superb as Robert the younger son who comes to the realization that his mother is horrible but can do nothing about escaping from his mother's spell. Joel McCrea at one point says painting roses on bathtubs  that's more your style. There is a very subtle suggestion in the film of Robert's sexuality.Irene Dunne is excellent in whatever film or genre she tried.".

Her need to control her son's lives was neurotically evil. If you've ever been in a relationship where you've been judged and found lacking and everybody involved knew it this may hit too close to home. It's been years since I saw this movie and I remember thinking that this plot and dialog would work in a 50's or 60's movie. It is difficult to watch because of the mother and sons' dynamic but I would love to watch it again. I keep hoping to find it on one of the old movie channels but so far no luck. Attempts to buy it were also futile I don't believe it's on tape or DVD.".

She tears up the screen with her portrayal of the mother obsessed by her love for her sons.  Eric Linden a rather weak actor is perfect as the one son.....Joel McCrae is ok as the other but since he is usually a man of action you hope he will pull out a pistol and blow Crewes' brains out. When one remembers a film several years after seeing it but one time it must be recommended.  You will either be attracted or repelled by this little gem".

There have been all sorts of tales particularly on stage during the first half of the 20th Century and on screen mostly during the early 1930's of women from the wrong side of the tracks who dared to fall in love above their stations causing the wrath of some matronly dowager. Barbara Stanwyck fought Clara Blandick in Shopworn Nancy Carroll fought Pauline Fredericks already her motherinlaw in Wayward. But when two lovely women of good breeding go after Crews' sons the situation somehow seems sicker and incestuous. What other reason could there be for Crews to hold onto her sons so tightly? One will win one will loose but the ultimate looser will be mama Crews the ultimate Mommie Dearest. She is magnificent in recreating her stage role blowing everybody else off screen with the intensity of her performance as if she were Judith Anderson in Medea or Laurette Taylor in the original The Glass Menagerie. The others do admirable work but when it comes down to it this will be remembered as the finest film work of the future Aunt Pittypat of Gone With the Wind.".

Eric Linden is another son who is engaged to Frances Dee unless poor pitiful mother has anything to do with it. I don't know much about the movies and career of Laura Hope Crews who played Aunt Pittypat in Gone with the Wind but I would surmise that this is one of her best and meatiest roles.

	schema:reviewBody "Irene Dunne wore darn near as much makeup as Lon Chaney Jr. in the Wolfman to portray the role of Victoria I.  She was a much underrated actress and the role fit her like a glove.  Then there's the late Sir Alec Guinness as Disraeli and the incomparable Finlay Curie as John Brown the only man who had leave to blow his nose in the presence of the Queen.  The tale focuses on a Mudlark a street urchin who lives off scrounging castaway goods from the mud banks of the Thames who finds a likeness of Queen Victoria and resolves to visit this Mother of all England.  How this event is used by Disraeli to get her to end her reclusive widowhood is the plot of the story. Alas no video and no DVD.  This superb classic too good for even its own time shows up from time to time on the late show and if it does don't miss it.  You'll be charmed by some outstanding performances and a winsome story. Oh.  Yes the kid gets to meet the Queen and she does join polite society once more.  That much is history.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw that Irene Dunne was cast as Queen Victoria I was ready to hate the film. After all she seems about as much like this historical figure as Shirley Temple! There was absolutely no way they could make this work. Well was I wrong...she was terrific and they managed to make her look like the middleaged monarch. I was amazed.The film begins on the filthy bank of the Thames River in London. Poor wretched boys work the bank as 'mudlarks'kids who will scour the shore for anything of value. This is much like the pathetic kids in places like India and Brazil who live among the garbage and scavenge for a meager living. A boy sees a cameo of the queen. He has no idea who she is but is captivated by how beautiful she looks. When he does learn it's the queen he decides to go to Windsor Castle and try to see her. By some strange circumstances he is able to make it inside and is eventually discovered. Where this fantasy story goes next is something you'll just need to see for yourself but in some ways it's like another fictional story about the British monarchy The Prince and the Pauper. But it also has a bit of the Dickens touchas there is quite an emphasis on social responsibility and the poor.The acting is just lovely. Dunne is perhaps at her best Alec Guinness is his usual amazing best and Finlay Currie though not exactly a mirror image of the man he played John Brown was lovely as well. A great script nice direction and quality all around make this a neat little fantasy film...and one that can be enjoyed by all ages.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fine film that is mainly forgotten but still worth seeing it deals with a homeless boy in Victorian London 1876 who rubs shoulders with two of the leading figures of the time  Queen Victoria and Benjamin Disraeli. A heartwarming story of historical fiction it displays the formidable acting talent of Irene Dunne and Alex Guinness. Disreali's audience with the Queen at the start draws us into the main themes of the movie. Andrew Ray as the boy is exceptional. The great character actor Finlay Currie plays the role of the Queen's friend John Brown a crusty boozy Scot and a close companion of the Queen who takes a personal interest in the boy. The character of John Brown was also the subject of the movie from the 1990's  Mrs. Brown played by Dame Judi Dench. The role of the mudlarka child who scavenges on the banks of the Thames is played by Andrew Ray. It was while doing thisthat he found a cameo of the Queen. Illiterate and povertystricken he knows nothing about the Queen but when he finds out who she is he wants to meet her. The discovery of the child during a banquet at Windsor Castle becomes a national story in which the Prime Minister Alex Guinness as Disraeli uses the issue to underscore the need for social reform and to thus win support for his government's program. The speech in the House of Commons is a high point in the movie as is the widowed Queen's encounter with the boy near the end of the film.Colourful conversations between Alex Guinness Disraeli and Findlay Currie John Brown add sparkle to the film as does a welllubricated Brown as he takes the boy on a tour of the castle. At the end Disraeli and Brown totally different in character are drawn together by their love of the monarch. The widowed monarch at first alarmed by the boy's stealing into her private residence is moved by a second encounter when she learns that he merely wanted to see her. This also suited the Prime Minister's purpose of giving the monarch confidence to come out of seclusion.".

	schema:headline " Mudlark on DVD";
	schema:reviewBody "This one is a genuine classic though many people will never have heard of it. It should have been elevated to near Oliver Twist mythos but it might have been thought Even more English and been dismissed. It tells of a time when people lived within the class system and could see grace and nobility in it. By this it shows us how human dignity does not reside in classes but within the souls of every individual.The story takes place in 1875 London and is about young Wheeler the very Mudlark himself. Mudlark was a name given street children who survive by scavenging on the banks of the River Thames. Wheeler there finds a cameo of Queen Victoria which he thinks to be so beautiful he risks his life to save it.When he presents the cameo for inspection to an older friend he is told that she is the mother of all England and Wheeler who had no mother adopts the idea that she is his mother. He becomes obsessed with meeting her. Victoria  however has adopted a seclusionary lifestyle despite advice from the likes of the savvy Benjamin Disraeli.He argues that her seclusion is hurting the crown and she must get out for the people to connect with her in at least the slightest way. Somehow the child gets past all of guards and walls to see his beloved mother. This despite the fact that Windsor castle is in preparations for a state dinner. What happens then is sparkling and wonderful. The cast is full of magnificent performances by the likes of Irene Dunne  Alec Guiness. This one has just about everything you could want from a film and a little bit more.If you're interested in a DVD copy of this film please contact sojourn at frodelius dot com".

	schema:headline " A Mudlark Meets His Queen Mother";
	schema:reviewBody "An orphan boy played by Andrew Ray finds a cameo or brooch of his Queen's picture in the banks of the river and when told she is the mother of England he vows to meet her. He likes her face. He likes what he sees. He likes how he feels when he looks at it. The time in England is that of Queen Victoria and here she is played by a barely recognized Irene Dunne as she caked with makeup. The young boy gets past the guards and by way of an accident he manages to get inside the castle hiding under a dining room table. He is eventually found but not before they think they've got an assassin on the grounds fearing for the Queen's life. All he wants he says is to meet her ladyship. The boy runs into John Brown played by Finlay Currie who promises to get him to her but nothing is that easy. Alec Guinness gives a very understated performance as statesman Benjamin Disraeli who advises Queen Victoria. And Irene Dunne is nothing but exquisite as the Queen despite the fact the Queen doesn't act especially kind or motherly she was known for her years in seclusion letting no one within her small circle of confidants. Only John Moore and Disraeli were her most trusted friends. Some say John Moore was closer than that. But this film does not dwell on that at all instead centering on the waif who set his sights on his Queen Mother so that he can see what one looks like. This was loosely based on true events. But in that case I don't think the young lad made it in the revered walls. The young actor Andrew Ray is mesmerizing and provides us with the film's heart and humor. Of course the highlight of the film is when he finally does get to meet his Queen and while the scenes may not be emotional as one would like they do provide Irene Dunne with a grand way to wrap up her long career in film. Unfortunately she ended her career with a comedy that has not been seen anywhere in years It Grows on Trees. But this would have a great last film for such a great actress who was never truly appreciated by the Academy losing the Oscar five times to fellow actresses. The Mudlark is one of those films that once it's over you say Now that was good. A truly underrated and forgotten movie experience is The Mudlark.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Mudlark is a story of a dark period of mourning in British history. So few love matches are found in the history of royalty that when one does occur it's treated with great reverence. So it was with Queen Victoria and her consort Prince Albert who gave her a bunch of kids that have insured the succession down to today.Albert died toward the end of 1861 of typhoid fever and Victoria went into an unusually long period of mourning. She boarded herself up in Windsor Castle conducted her state business there and made no public appearances for well over a decade.Now it's the Mid1870s and the monarchy is losing its appeal. Subjects like to see their ruler every now and then but Victoria will not leave her seclusion.All that is disturbed when a young street urchin played by Andrew Ray for whom the Queen has taken on mythic proportions has journeyed from London and crashed Windsor Castle disrupting things pretty good. Of course security is breached but Victoria gets a lesson in her duties and obligations as Queen.Irene Dunne in her next to last big screen appearance plays a regal and imperious Victoria. A good supporting cast is led by Alec Guinness as Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli and Finlay Currie as John Brown her equerry and companion. Currie is the best in this film he fits my conception of Brown as the rough Scot who likes his drink but loves his monarch.An interesting tale of how the black veil of mourning for Queen Victoria is lifted.".

	schema:reviewBody "With my nearlifelong love of classic film and period dramasfilms particularly ones based on historical figures and there are plenty of classics in this regard 'The Mudlark' intrigued me straight away. Especially when it contained two of the biggest historical figures the as of now secondlongest reigning monarch Queen Victoria and one of Britain's most important prime minsters Benjamin Disraeli. Further sparking interest was the cast with the involvement of Irene Dunne Alec Guinness and Finlay Currie promising an enormous amount. Will admit thinking before seeing 'The Mudlark' that Dunne seemed an odd choice for Victoria having looked nothing like Victoria herself in middle age. Needn't have worried. Did have a gut feeling that even with that reservation 'The Mudlark' would be a little gem sadly overlooked today. It turned out to be exactly that.Sure figuring out how it would end may have been quite easy early on and occasionally at first the film is a touch stately but one doesn't care so much about those when everything else is so brilliant.On a visual level 'The Mudlark' is very handsomely shot which does justice to the sets and costumes that are both lavish and evocative. The music score from William Alwyn is not discordant and has presence without intruding. The film was directed in a way showing a keen eye for detail and an ease and passion for the subject.In terms of writing the script is really quite masterly very erudite and thoughtprovoking with the highlight being Disraeli's speech which was really quite powerful. The story both with the boy's quest and Disraeli's attempt to get Victoria out of solitude is compelling and emotionally resonant with nothing ringing false.'The Mudlark' is a masterclass when it comes to the acting. Andrew Ray is endearing and very easy to relate to and Currie is suitably crusty as John Brown. It's the two leads who dominate especially the marvel that is Guinness who transforms himself into this shrewd intelligent and sympathetic man. Unreognisable Dunne is imperious and dignified making for some movingly sincere moments. Her and Guinness have a very believable chemistry together an affectionate one which was very much accurate in reality.Concluding a little gem that should be better known. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "So let me get this straight. This teenager wants to expose this secret government laboratory... by building an atomic bomb with material he steals from the facility and taking it to a science fair. And he wants to expose this facility because... they didn't tell anyone they were a secret plutonium facility and thereby make themselves a target for espionage and theft?So as I said his solution to the warmongering military authorities building atomic bombs is to build one himself. And they're warmongering because they want to build atomic bombs because hostile countries with a doctrine of overthrowing countries to spread their political beliefs would do the same to the US if they could because they also have atomic bombs right? Then when the government officials learn that this kid has stolen weapons grade material and has built a bomb with it they have to gall to take over his mom's house while she cries What gives you the right?!Then and get this then when he learns the government has found out he has stolen weapons grade material and built a bomb with it and he threatens to set it off for no other logical reason anyone can think of other than not wanting to get thrown in jail for something HE did everyone acts surprised when the government acts ready to kill him to stop him and everyone thinks that's just a terrible thing. No wait they want to kill him not just to stop him but also to keep the facility a secret.... after a whole bunch of people already know what's going on.And when the bomb almost goes off because this genius kid was too stupid to know what he was doing he gets to walk away as a local hero because he built a bomb with weapons grade material that he stole from the facility and almost wiped out his friends family everyone in the town and surrounding areas including the mean government officials who were ready to kill him because he threatened to set off an atomic bomb with material he stole from the facility.Riiiiigggghhhhhhtttt.........".

Paul's nonchalance comes out in the exchange They can't do anything to me. Why not? Because I'm underage. HUH? You're smart enough to build a freaking nuclear bomb by yourself including smart enough to know where to get some explosive material needed to blow the bomb up. You're also smart enough to have fooled a highsecurity system with a bunch of frisbees and a helpful girlfriend in order to get the plutonium and smart enough to temporarily cover your tracks by inserting shampoo into the jar so it's not immediately noticed as missing. But what in the world makes you think that they'll let you go because I'm underage? I suppose the script writer needed to show a little naivet  after all if Paul knew the full gravity of what he was doing he might not have done something as reckless as he did. Instead he might just have gone ahead with an expose without needing to win first prize at a science contest.".

No yellow rubber gloves are gonna protect him from the radiation.It looks like he's going for an implosion design with his bomb like the Nagasaki bomb. That's really smart. Especially since the gun design Hiroshima bomb is far easier to build but maybe he is aware that the implosion design will have a far greater efficiency so he can incinerate far more people with it if that's what he wants? That's where another thought occurs Why is he complaining about the morality of the lab when he builds a bomb of his own? Then there is more unprotected working with the material. Even if the material was only slightly radioactive for some reason his nice fluffy hair would have fallen out halfway through building his device. At the least we would have seen lots of vomiting! To sum it up tired of writing this as I am it's just all horrible anyway! I can't understand why a movie with that name couldn't have been a bit more interesting realistic and possibly talk about the real Manhattan Project instead!".

Hey pick up the phone and make a call. He thinks that he can't get into any trouble because I'm only a kid. Who told him that? For a bright boy he doesn't seem like it. He breaks into the lab and steals plutonium... that ought to be worth 20 to life right there. He's Edward Teller in disguise and builds an A bomb with his Mattel Do it yourself kit. Yeah... sure. Best of all he handles the plutonium with his mom's dish washing rubber gloves?!!! He'd be dead in no time. He takes his bomb to the big fair to show off? To show off what? That he's a complete nincompoop? Even the other nerds know better than that. If I hadn't been waiting for another friend in order to leave I would have exited this complete nonsense as soon as he started playing cutesy with the plutonium strapped to the back of his toy car.

	schema:reviewBody "A boy genius builds an atomic bomb with plutonium he steals from his mother's wouldbe boyfriend. A barely plausible premise but what the heck it's a movie. I can only imagine the producers and actors all anticipating the acclaim that they hope to achieve with this ripoff of 'War Games'. 'War Games' featuring Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy was clever hip interesting funny at times and believable everything that this movie is not. The first scare is John Lithgow as a love interest with Jill Eikenberry. He is not likely to set feminine hearts aflutter and Jill looks great except that her hair looks like it lost a battle with a wombat. As to the clich's forgive me if I leave out a few dozen as there are so many 1 The kid opens everything with a handy nail file from his nail clipper that he always happens to have in his pocket. He even opens pintumbler locks which I assure you are not amenable to nail files. 2 He breaks into the lab to steal the plutonium swaps it with a bottle of shampoo then packs everything back into his gym bag EXCEPT the plutonium which he tapes to the back of a remote control car. You see if he just put the plutonium in his gym bag with all the other stuff including the huge remote controller for the car there would be no reason to fire up the enormous ArgonIon LASER BEAM which he uses to cut a hole in the building to smuggle out the plutonium. And of course the cutsey part where the dodering old fool of a security guard would have no reason to stumble around in dark with flashlight looking for god knows whatever while the kid zooms the car around. Duh! 3 Lithgow brings the kid a puzzle where you are supposed to get four balls in each corner the kid sets it down and spins it. Eureka problems solved! Only you can see that coming a mile away. And the grand prize clich is at the end when they all must clip the six detonator wires SIMULTANIOUSLY! GASP! to prevent the impending nuclear explosion. Except that they only have I bet you know already FIVE wire cutters! But guess what? The kid whips out his handydandy nail clipper to save the day! TADA! Whoooo Maybe I'm being harsh and taking advantage of twenty years of hindsight after all lasers now fit on key chains instead of taking up entire rooms but seriously the technical direction in this movie is awful. Despite all that it is entertaining and if you have the opportunity watch it. And while you watch take a good look at all the actors that you will never see again after contributing to this bomb.".

The storyline is credible enough with a bit of imagination stretching the acting is tolerable only the irony is laid on a bit too thick. I found the attitude of the principal character to be much too cynical unrealistic and extremely condescending even for the likes of some precocious sciencesavvy prodigy. Getting back to the entertainment value the plot progresses expectedly only it thickens toward the direction of the surrealistic though the basic concept is actually pretty frightening. However the movie is watchable with its impressive cast a young Cynthia Nixon John Lithgow Chris Collet et al. I have mixed feelings about this film I did enjoy watching it but when I began to rationalize it began to appear quite nonsensical. So if you intend on watching it simply keep your powers of logic and common sense subdued and it will remain an enjoyable experience.".

From nuclear radiation triggering detectors without hurting people to a single rentacop defending an entire nuclear weapons lab to one teenager doing in a month what took Oppenheimer and company years to the U.S. military letting national security breaches walk away into the sunset there is just no way to focus on the story when faced with so many intellectual insults.

Would all the world's superpure plutonium be guarded by an old coot who appears to be legally blind and a thick besides? Why does Cynthia Nixon ask all their friends to drive to where a nuclear bomb is? Why does Paul need a written statement about the pure plutonium lab if he has the pure plutonium himself? Why does Paul's Mom forget to shampoo? Oh that one actually does get answered.There are too many howlers to believe in this thing. It came from the same guy who wrote SLEEPER in which the nonsense science was part of the comedy. WAR GAMES is more plausible but it ends with the same silly speeches.

The story is interesting in its concept smart kid builds nuclear device and is barely saved from blowing everyone to smithereens. Vide War Games. Its execution however makes one squirm with discomfort rather than suspense. First the acting isn't bad. John Lithgow is especially effective in his scenes with Jill Eikenberry  a genuinely nice guy just trying to get along. The rest of the performances are adequate. But the character played by Christopher Collett is truly abrasive. His scientific intellect is honed to a razor edge as we find out near the beginning when he arranges a small explosion in the lab drawer of a fellow student who is his rival in science class. Hilarious. His smugness is almost unbearable. And science is about all he's good at. He realizes that Lithgow is hitting on my mom innocently enough and resents him for it. He doesn't seem to know what an Oedipus complex is. He hasn't heard of Woodward and Bernstein. He asks Who's Anne Frank? and isn't being rhetorical. Worst of all he doesn't really care about his nonscientific ignorance. He's only a few steps removed from the maniac in Pi. The plot is simply unbelievable. He may be extremely clever but unless he has some sort of PSI power as well he could not disarm the alarm system in two shakes of a lamb's tail  let alone unfailingly operate the complex robotic systems in the laboratory. And without so much as a previous glance at it he knows that the inner wall of the lab can be cut with a pen knife and he knows just where to cut it too. He may be superhuman as well.Radioactive plutonium is still radioactive even without having reached critical mass isn't it? And although rubber gloves may stop larger particles like protons they don't provide much protection against gamma rays do they? I may be wrong but at least I'm willing to admit my ignorance which is more than this egocentric showoff is able to do.The first time I saw this movie it was fascinating especially the first half not the last part which deteriorates into a familiar pattern. But I saw it again recently and found it more irritating than anything else because of Collett's character and because the plot was so full of holes. At least I HOPE it was full of holes. If it were so easy to throw together a nuclear weapon occupying a space the size of a trombone case and to do so in only a few weeks I'd hate to think of what might happen if some religious fundamentalist antimodernization Ludditic cryptolunatic saw the movie and it gave him ideas.The ending is a heartwarming development in which Lithgow decides the fight the military and declares No more secrets and throw open the gates to the college kids cheering outside.

	schema:reviewBody "Manhattan Project is a thriller... maybe a little too aware of its own social importance but it has some very funny scenes the science fair's a laugh riot especially for anyone who's ever been in one. And the dramatic parts are great too.It's just when you start digesting the movie it becomes a bit absurd. It doesn't take a nuclear weapons geek to realize that the government would rather make the purest plutonium on Earth in Los Alamos New Mexico where it already owns a county or two of desert sealed for your and their protection from spies and leaks of nasty stuff and not Ithaca New York. Even the plutonium plant in West Valley New York would be a bad place for such a thing because all the plutonium there is regularly inspected by a UN agency and the plutonium in THIS movie is military plutonium which the Departments of Energy and Defense would rather NOT have the IAEA inspecting.Also OK nuclear physicists get horny and date cute real estate agents.

I'll I'll I'll STEAL his PLUTONIUM THAT'S what I'll do! And really what's this kid's PROBLEM anyway? He's got study dates with a girl built for sin and he's POed because his mom's dating someone considerate enough to show him a milliondollar excimer laser? Stranger things have happened in real life but I dunno... it blew my willing suspension of disbelief away for a while.But it's a good film. Worth ONE viewing at least.".

	onyx:emotionText "Manhattan Project is a thriller... maybe a little too aware of its own social importance but it has some very funny scenes the science fair's a laugh riot especially for anyone who's ever been in one. And the dramatic parts are great too.It's just when you start digesting the movie it becomes a bit absurd. It doesn't take a nuclear weapons geek to realize that the government would rather make the purest plutonium on Earth in Los Alamos New Mexico where it already owns a county or two of desert sealed for your and their protection from spies and leaks of nasty stuff and not Ithaca New York. Even the plutonium plant in West Valley New York would be a bad place for such a thing because all the plutonium there is regularly inspected by a UN agency and the plutonium in THIS movie is military plutonium which the Departments of Energy and Defense would rather NOT have the IAEA inspecting.Also OK nuclear physicists get horny and date cute real estate agents.

	schema:reviewBody "Singapore's track record with animation has been admirable but poor with the earliest foray being production houses plunging headlong thinking computer generated graphics was the way to go undoubtedly fueled by Pixar's success with the medium. But what was keenly forgotten was that story remained king which films like Zodiac The Race Begins Legend of the Sea and surprisingly Sing to the Dawn based upon an acclaimed book all failed to come out with narratives to engage passing off as really childish attempts with laughable artwork that paled in comparison to what it wanted to emulate.I suppose if Eric Khoo had opened the doors for the Singapore film community once before in generating buzz in the earlier days of our film renaissance if I can call it that then he's clearly doing that again by showing that animated films can be done by Singapore production teams if done properly. Some may quibble with the fact that Tatsumi is an animated film done by animators who are largely based offshore but I'd say to give credit when credit is due especially when there's a significant marked improvement from their animated film without a doubt having found a project comfortable enough to play to the strengths of a small team.You would have known the background to how this film came about already from the various press releases interviews and articles ever since the film was slated to make its world premiere in Cannes earlier this year. In what would be a tribute to one of his idols Eric Khoo had decided to venture into making not a live action film but an animated one adapting from the autobiography of Gekiga master Yoshihiro Tatsumi and his short stories with the artist's blessings of course and furthermore having to involve Tatsumi himself in providing additional inputs to bringing his creations to life on the big screen especially helping to fill in the blanks behind where once were bubble speeches from his comic books as well as imparting what would be key to the authenticity of the film  the keen eye for detail so much so that this film is truly Japanese in spirit.For those uninitiated with Tatsumi's works then this film will serve as that quick start guide to his visual style and the stories that he's told through the graphic medium and in many ways you'd see why they are so appealing to filmmaker Eric Khoo drawing pardon the unintentional pun parallels with the filmmaker and the artist since the former was also once a cartoonist himself and the darker content more adult tales that Tatsumi draws about. In some ways the narrative structure is similar to Khoo's earlier film Be With Me where it tells the biographical tale of a remarkable individual interspersed between other stories. Here the film adapts from Tatsumi's autobiographical manga A Drifting Life an astounding 800 pages worth that chronicles the artist's struggles and inspiration.One can imagine the sheer effort it took to condense that amount of material spanning decades of the master's life up it was mentioned that he's working on the next volume that will culminate in his attendance at Cannes this year for the film's opening and clearly that arc forms the core that engages especially for anyone wanting to know more about the artist himself since major milestones are covered. But the short stories  Hell Beloved Monkey Just a Man GoodBye and Occupied  all provided that glimpse into the type of tales his art accompanied that he had pioneered suited more for the adult with its darker tones and themes graphic in nature too. And kudos to the director in knowing just when to make the transition between biography and short story at moments most apt that do not seem too jarring nor confusing.The animation style which looked a lot like simple cut out animation played to the production house's strengths where things are kept simple based on the artistry of Tatsumi himself therefore having his books serving as natural storyboards with the obvious understanding that the look and feel of the film cannot and should not venture too far that it doesn't look like what had been designed by its creator. It's a limitation and constraint that worked wonders for Infinite Frameworks Studios and should go about exorcising the demons from its earlier animated film effort.Personally I would have loved to see more of Tatsumi's struggles in this movie but the best way to do that is to go back to the source material. Hopefully this animated film will pique your interest in the master artist and his works and if this film helps the casual viewer to pick up any of Tatsumi's books and from there turn some into fans then this film homage would have successfully done its job. Recommended! And yes do pick up the book as well!".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Eric Khoo Tatsumi explores the life and work of the celebrated manga artist Yoshihiro Tatsumi who created the gekiga style of alternative comic books for adults. Animated in Indonesia with Japanese dialogue and based on Tatsumi's 800page memoir A Drifting Life and other works the film was shown in the Un Certain Regard section at this year's Cannes Film Festival and has been selected as the Singaporean entry for Best Foreign Language film at the Oscars.It depicts five different historical periods in Japanese history and dramatizes five stories of postwar Japan Hell Beloved Monkey Just a Man GoodBye and Occupied. These stories with their adult content that includes sex and violence are reported to have drastically altered the medium in Japan.Tatsumi is the narrator of his own biography and explains how he grew up in a dysfunctional environment with six other children. He began to draw as a child and was tenyearsold when the Second World War ended. When he was a teenager he started to publish his work and describes a meeting with his idol Osama Tezuka. Unhappy with the genre that restricted manga to children he began to experiment with darker themes designed to appeal to adults. Color is used for his bio and one story while the others use a monochrome hue.Hell is a bizarre story about a photographer covering the aftermath of Hiroshima and discovers two figures burned onto a wall that of a boy apparently giving his mother a back massage before the bomb hit. He becomes rich from the sale of this picture until a twist undermines the whole idea. In Beloved Monkey a lapse in judgment by a factory worker results in an unwanted result for his pet monkey. An older worker decides to spend all of his savings on women in Just a Man' but the consequences are not what he intended.Goodbye tells the dark story of a prostitute who is abandoned by an American soldier and takes her anger out on her father. The final story Occupied has a man obsessed with graffiti on the walls of public restroom a story bordering on the offensive. Apparently these themes are normal for Japanese manga but to a Western audience their appeal is dubious although the narration by Tatsumi gives the film a feeling of authenticity. Beyond the questionable material however Tatsumi's stories may be commenting on the decay of Japanese society.".

Animated in Indonesia with Japanese dialogue and based on Tatsumi's 800page memoir A Drifting Life and other works the film was shown in the Un Certain Regard section at this year's Cannes Film Festival and has been selected as the Singaporean entry for Best Foreign Language film at the Oscars.It depicts five different historical periods in Japanese history and dramatizes five stories of postwar Japan Hell Beloved Monkey Just a Man GoodBye and Occupied. These stories with their adult content that includes sex and violence are reported to have drastically altered the medium in Japan.Tatsumi is the narrator of his own biography and explains how he grew up in a dysfunctional environment with six other children. He began to draw as a child and was tenyearsold when the Second World War ended. When he was a teenager he started to publish his work and describes a meeting with his idol Osama Tezuka. Unhappy with the genre that restricted manga to children he began to experiment with darker themes designed to appeal to adults. Color is used for his bio and one story while the others use a monochrome hue.Hell is a bizarre story about a photographer covering the aftermath of Hiroshima and discovers two figures burned onto a wall that of a boy apparently giving his mother a back massage before the bomb hit. He becomes rich from the sale of this picture until a twist undermines the whole idea. In Beloved Monkey a lapse in judgment by a factory worker results in an unwanted result for his pet monkey. An older worker decides to spend all of his savings on women in Just a Man' but the consequences are not what he intended.Goodbye tells the dark story of a prostitute who is abandoned by an American soldier and takes her anger out on her father. The final story Occupied has a man obsessed with graffiti on the walls of public restroom a story bordering on the offensive. Apparently these themes are normal for Japanese manga but to a Western audience their appeal is dubious although the narration by Tatsumi gives the film a feeling of authenticity. Beyond the questionable material however Tatsumi's stories may be commenting on the decay of Japanese society.";

In a very generalize fashion that makes most people look almost identical they usually vary in their hair style and clothing so we can tell them apart. This aspect of Manga is still here but the stories are nothing like the romantic or scifi stories Manga lovers are so familiar with. Tatsumi is interested in the real life stories of real Japanese or to be precise among all the stories presented in this film there's a common thread  the interest in people that can't handle success the only one among these treated in the movie that lives well with his success is Tatsumi himself we get to see his autobiography in between the stories and he himself says in the film how he hated all those success stories popping up all around him in the years of the great economic boom in Japan. If this was an American movie we'd be speaking about losers one of the terms I detest the most but Tatsumi has no judgmental approach to people that can't handle success he understands them and in fact likes them better than the success driven people around them. For these stories and for the novel approach to Manga this movie is highly recommended even if I didn't think it was perfect.".

Most of the time these fit in all right with the story but it is hard not to feel that it would have been an even better film if they had stayed closer to the original in the later parts.  In all honesty though none of this prevents it from being a very good movie in its own right.For the most part the main story is the familiar one following the hopes and anxieties of the Bennet family as they look for husbands for their five daughters.  Greer Garson might be slightly different from the Elizabeth of the novel but she is very appealing and her character is quite effective. Laurence Olivier works very well as the prideful Darcy.  Most of the supporting cast also is good especially Edmund Gwenn as the perpetually bemused Mr. Bennet.  It does a good job of illustrating the main themes in the relationships amongst the characters while also providing many light and humorous moments.

Why? I think because movies and television have been more segmented. In 1940 Hollywood was appealing to everyone attending their weekly movies  from the 8 year old girl to the 60 year old man from the miner to the mine owner banker and sewer worker. In America alone 90 million people attended the movies EACH WEEK in the early 1940s. As a result Hollywood felt it had to appeal to all  and that some aspects of classics could be made more palatable in making them more mainstream.  Horrors say the purists. Well I don't think so  but yes I do prefer the more recent version of everything. And yet this is a delightful charming humorous moving film. Greer Garson and Maureen O'Sullivan Laurence Olivier Frieda Inescourt what a voice! Edna May Oliver Gwenn and all the rest of the cast are fun great fun to watch.

I don't know how much of it is borrowed or adapted from Austin and how much is Huxley's clever creation but it's just plain wonderful. Witty without being nasty or supercilious it's a joy from beginning to end.Second the script's wonderful dialogue is delivered with zest and nuance by great actors chief among them Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivier.

I don't know how much of it is borrowed or adapted from Austin and how much is Huxley's clever creation but it's just plain wonderful. Witty without being nasty or supercilious it's a joy from beginning to end.Second the script's wonderful dialogue is delivered with zest and nuance by great actors chief among them Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivier.

Sure the costumes were laughable and a few things not quite right but surprisingly enough it was all good fun. I didn't much care for the portrayal of Mrs Bennet but Laurence Olivier's Darcy was excellent if not entirely accurate. The story was going along swingingly I was surprised after reading bad reviews that it was actually relatively accurate that is until we return to Longborne from Hunsford. After that EVERYTHING hits the clinker nothing makes any sense or has any real resemblance to the novel. I squirmed my way through the last half hour forcing myself to watch on. Instead of being pleasantly surprised by the movie as I anticipated whilst watching the first half I was left with a definite feeling of distaste and dissatisfaction. I don't think I could even enjoy this movie with the ending as it is if I had never read the book. Nothing is explained properly or dwelled upon it is a quick succession of events that I feel if I had no understanding of the book would not make a lot of sense.Overall while I had moments of enjoyment my impression of this movie is not at all satisfying.".

	schema:reviewBody "It does not run along the lines of the Jane Austen classic but the 1940 movie was actually based on the stage adaption eventually purchased by the MGM studio as what could have become another Norma Shearer expensive spectacle. Like many other projects at the studio this collected dust after the death of Irving Thalberg head of MGM. Thankfully new casting was decided on. Shearer of course is really too old for the role. The result was what I believe to be one of the most memorable movies of the 1940s. Austen's classic comedy of manners still has all its light touches of romance and humour with the horrors of English 1800s loss of estate inheritance and destined sinking with no worldly stature for a family of five girls with no male heirs.Amicably backed by a competent supporting cast including Edmund Gwenn and Mary Boland the star of the show is really Greer Garson. Fresh from her successful debut as Robert Donat's wife in Goodbye Mr Chips Garson is really like Lizzy Bennett herself charming high spirited and strong willed. It is one of her best roles just before she became the 'first lady' of MGM. Olivier brooding and snobbish as the high classed Darcy also performs well but is still outshone by Garson.Tasteful sets costumes music and art decoration helped to make this such a huge success in its day. All the right elements of acting script and direction have made this a production that should be better remembered. We don't relate to the dilemnas of costume period drama days but Pride and Prejudice is great cinematically to have lost little of its charm or its timeless appeal. Rating 910".

Last night I finally saw the oldest of the 3 and was aghast. I could not believe all the liberties taken with Jane Austen's masterpiece. New characters were added scenes changed  which so far is not that bad considering the time constraints. What really horrified me was the complete change in personalities of the main characters. Darcy is not supposed to openly admire Lizzy until after her rejection  until then he is supposed to be struggling with himself trying to control his feelings until he cannot hold them any longer. Laurence Olivier was definitely not indifferent to Greer Garson's Elizabeth  his performance was much more subtle and nuanced definitely superior in every aspect playing Max de Winter in Rebecca a wonderful movie which oddly enough was released in the same year as this production of PP. It just confirmed my longstanding belief that no one can play Mr. Darcy better than Colin Firth. Greer Garson looked too old to play Lizzy  but that's beside the point. She lacked the playfulness that Jennifer Ehle was able to bring to the character. Garson by comparison was very stiff. But what really shocked me was Lady Catherine. According to the book until the end she is supposed to oppose Darcy's marriage to Lizzy and here she not only admires Elizabeth but helped Darcy in obtaining Lizzy's acceptance of his proposal! These are absolutely NOT minor details. These changes touch the core of the book and that in my opinion is inadmissible.Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is not an openly funny book  it makes you laugh by being witty two very different things. This production of PP somehow found the need to add comedy relief such as the parrot and music box scene when Lady Catherine goes to Longbourn. Another reason why I love Jane Austen so much is that all her novels have a happy ending. But for this movie that was not enough. They had to end it with introducing a love interest for Mary who is supposed to end up alone with her parents and match Denny with Kitty. Adding all this up it was actually painful to watch. But I finally gave up when Lydia called Whickham Whicky... Puhlease! This is definitely a travesty of a movie unworthy of such a wonderful novel.

They ALL seemed like silly little girls and although Garson's Elizabeth had an opportunity to demonstrate how modern her thinking was she still came off as comical not to be taken seriously. Austen made a very clear distinction in her work between Lizzy and Jane on the one hand intelligent reflective serious and sensitive and their 3 younger sisters flighty manhungry vacuous and that difference provided a potent frequently humourous backdrop to the character development and plot in her work.  This version didn't even come close to presenting such a distinction.Others' comments take care of the rest of my objections to this drivel so I won't repeat them here.

Did he learn anything about himself in the course of his relationship with her  other than her superior skill at archery which in its attempt to show her to be full of surprises and quite capable of upsetting Darcy's composure only added to all the silliness.The novel helps us understand how bright intelligent and introspective individuals can accept their limitations change their way of thinking about others and themselves and grow tremendously in the process.

She is twice that and it shows. One winces every time she does something girlish like flash those eyes flirtatiously. Elizabeth did not flirt. And oh please the bow and arrow scene. Then there is the rather hollow Laurence Oliver doing his brittle best as Darcy. Was there ever a more irritating voice on screen and off? Somewhere between a burp and staccato gunfire. The hoops and the gowns and the hats all circa Civil War America. And why oh why did they soften up Catherine De Burgh. Unforgivable. I could go on and on... but I will spare you and me. 5 out of 10.

Yes there's such a thing as dramatic licence and with half decent screenplay and a bit of dramatic tension best achieved simply by getting closer to the novel that might have worked.Don't just say but this was in 1940. They knew how to make good movies back then. Rebecca won best Picture and Philadelphia Story and Grapes of Wrath were nominated. Larry himself got a Best Actor nomination for Rebecca and must have wondered what on earth he was doing in this sad shambles. And this somehow won a Best Art Direction Oscar.

	schema:reviewBody "Although some of the wit and commentary of Jane Austen's novel has been left out of this MGM production of Pride and Prejudice what remains is a nice romantic story of the five Bennett sisters and their efforts to find husbands.Remember this is 19th century Great Britain with all those class distinctions and a crazy law that the Bennett family estate cannot pass through a female. This puts Edmund Gwenn and Mary Boland in a real pickle. They've got five daughters and they'd better get them all wed to respectable people before the Bennetts take leave of this world.Their closest male heir is Melville Cooper a cousin who is one ghastly boor of an individual. In the novel Cooper is a clergyman not unlike Reverend Ascoyne D'Ascoyne in Kind Hearts and Coronets. But in the days of the Code you could not show a clergyman in a bad light or make him a figure of fun. Still without his profession noted Cooper turns in a performance that for him is one of two career roles the other being the sheriff of Nottingham in The Adventures of Robin Hood.Edmund Gwenn has a wonderful part as the patient Mr. Bennett. Eddie Cantor could have identified with him because he was the father of five daughters and learned patience the hard way also. In addition to the daughters he has Mary Boland and her pretensions to deal with. The chemistry they have is very similar to that which she had with Charlie Ruggles when they were paired in bunch of films in the Thirties.Mary Boland is perfect casting for Mrs. Bennett she truly imprints her personality on the part. So does Edna May Oliver as the formidable Lady Catherine DeBoerg. She's a patroness of Melville Cooper why I can't figure out but he genuflects at the mention of her name. And he uses her name the way Mattie Ross used her lawyer J. Noble Daggett's name in True Grit. Lady Catherine is a part also just written for Edna May Oliver. When that woman wasn't formidable on the screen I don't remember. She's also the aunt of Laurence Olivier who is trying to overcome his own class snobbery in courting Greer Garson one of the five Bennett sisters.Of course Olivier and Garson are the leads but Pride and Prejudice depends more and succeeds on the strength of its ensemble of great character players perfectly cast. Olivier himself was not happy during the production as he expected to do this film with his wife Vivien Leigh. Still he's fine in the part as is Garson. She's got more sass in her makeup than her crinolined sisters and Olivier also shows more character than when we first meet him as a typical Regency snob.I like Pride and Prejudice but I like it for the performances of Cooper Boland Gwenn and Oliver than for either of the leads. They're good but they're support is fabulous.".

Terrible.Austen's novel and prose exhibited a great deal of wit which this version mistakes for a kind of breezy humor but beneath her wit Austen was also writing about a time and societal structure in which social standing and the appearance of certain respectability was everything. For the characters involved even Elizabeth who tried to appear not to not care at times the unfolding of the story's events all come with serious consequences attached.My impression of this version is that it seemed largely unaware of the story's more dire concerns. Mrs. Bennet's desire to see her daughters married is treated here as kind of amusing but in the book and in the reality of the time her fears that her daughters will lose their standing are not without merit. The society they live in really doesn't offer many opportunities for her daughters.This version seems to be all about love Austen's novel is really a story of survival. That Jane and Elizabeth both also happen to find their heart's true love while marrying well is really something of a miracle. In Austen's world love and marriage did not always run hand in hand.Having just seen the 2005 version the lack of Austen's bite was all the more evident. This version just gets so many things wrong. The actresses playing the Bennet sisters are all way too old for their roles. In the book Elizabeth is not yet one and twenty and Lydia is a young twerp of 15 or 16 when she runs away with Wickham. Lady De Bourgh's actions in the end of this version are just plain ridiculous the resolution is neat and tidy wrapped up far too quickly and throughly wrong. Other changes in the story are just baffling. Enjoy this version if you must but for me it was like watching a Cliff Notes version that was written by someone who hadn't actually read the story himself but had only heard about from a friend.".

	schema:reviewBody "My wife and I read Pride and Prejudice together about thirty years ago. I have since read it several more times as has she. There are very few books that I have read more than once so my love for the book is evidenced. There are many radical departures of this movie from the book the most regrettable being the omission of the Pemberley Estate scenes. But I still must give it a 1010. Some of the changes seem to be actually preferable from an entertainment point of view. But as I reread the novel as I have two or three times since first seeing the movie I appreciate both versions.This is a movie that sits in its case on our entertainment center in our bedroom. Once or twice a year when the offerings on the tube become unbearable it's popped into the VCR and never fails to entertain.This book and the movie have been a launching pad for us on the road of entertainment. We have both since read most of the Austen novels. The only other one we have enjoyed on the screen is Emma Gwyneth Paltrow though we have tried several other screen versions including the 5 hour version of PP. It also was a starting point for searching out more Greer Garson  Lawrence Olivier movies. It was the first movie we saw with either of these great stars in it. Then of course you can't be a Greer Garson fan without becoming a Walter Pidgeon fan  and it goes on and on. And this was the beautiful starting point for all of this fun.".

There are very few books that I have read more than once so my love for the book is evidenced. There are many radical departures of this movie from the book the most regrettable being the omission of the Pemberley Estate scenes. But I still must give it a 1010. Some of the changes seem to be actually preferable from an entertainment point of view. But as I reread the novel as I have two or three times since first seeing the movie I appreciate both versions.This is a movie that sits in its case on our entertainment center in our bedroom. Once or twice a year when the offerings on the tube become unbearable it's popped into the VCR and never fails to entertain.This book and the movie have been a launching pad for us on the road of entertainment.

	schema:reviewBody "I really don't know where to start or what to start with but having grown up with the 1995 version I am admittedly prejudiced.Let's take the costumes. Anyone with a really keen eye will spot that not only are the costumes too late for the period 1850s they are also totally unsynchronised. In one scene these dresses are accompanied by the sort of bonnets popular in the 1830s. Also most married women tended to wear little lace caps  Mrs Bennet is never seen in one. The fact that the titles announced the setting to be Old England worried me slightly and I felt that some of the characters' subtleties were lost. Would Mrs. Bennet really have appeared to keen to marry off her daughters in public? Also some of her lines seemed a bit contrived e.g. Five thousand pounds a year and not married. That's the most heartening piece of news since the Battle of Waterloo. Even that should tell anyone who hasn't seen it that Aldous Huxley as screenwriter seems to have missed out most of Jane Austen's dialogue. The opening credits also reveal that this is based on a dramatisation of the novel  what's wrong with basing the screenplay on the novel itself? The carriage race with the Lucases is pathetic and in no way in keeping with the book. I can't swear to it but I'm pretty sure the Bennets wouldn't have bought tickets to the Assembly Room ball. The structure of the film totally ignored the novel  Wickham is present much too early  and many scenes appear to have been amalgamated or missed out entirely. The Meryton ball and the Lucases party is combined into one occasion which  surprise surprise  introduces Wickham's story much earlier than it should. Similarly the Rosings visit is virtually packed into the one scene and Lydia's return home is combined with Lady Catherine's visit to Longbourn. Some of the manners and behaviour seem far too modern for the early 1800s. The waltz was considered improper even in the 1890s because it meant a man and a woman were physically too close together for the standards of the time. Elizabeth also remarks at one point about her daring underwear  Jane Austen's Elizabeth never made any comments like that. Whole chunks of the plot  between leaving Charlotte and Mr Collins and Lydia's elopement  go mysteriously missing. The Bennets never planned on moving house to escape the shame of Lydia's elopement and Darcy's explanation of Wickham's history comes much later than it should. Contrary to what the film suggests Lady Catherine was never trying to further Darcy's relationship with Elizabeth  which was obvious from the start  and she never had any control over his money either. It's a great film if you want to see a misinterpretation of Jane Austen's story or if you don't take the original story as definitive but if you're looking for a faithful version try the BBC's 1995 version.".
