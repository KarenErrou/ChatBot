Characters develop new relationships and interact differently from the show. The three EVA pilots from the original series get some great development here and differ a lot from NGE in a very good way. New characters are introduced stakes are raised and the film has a lot of build up which boils down to one hell of a climax.The film has a more intense tone this time around and is very fast paced. The action is incredibly engaging and the film is the first in a while that has gotten my heart beating like crazy during the intense action onscreen. The film does give you breathing space with lighthearted interactions between characters and humor and thus makes it less heavy overall than NGE and EOE even though it certainly is more gruesome and still has it's moments of pure nightmare fuel.The Score of Evangelion is at it's best in this film and truly delivers. It varies from beautifully orchestrated racing score to sweet and engaging Jpop and Anno sure makes the outofplace songs fit as well as he did in the show and EOE. The entire experience watching this addition to the series is unforgettable and gives me much hope for even more improvement in the next two installments.Overall the film is a vast improvement for the series and hints at better things to come with it's significant changes and has raised the stakes for the Evangelion universe. Anno seems to have gotten over his depression completely and bloomed into a true crafter of worlds and emotionally charged storytelling.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been a long wait but better late than never I'd say. One of the classic mecha science fiction anime now undergoing a revamp of its own and despite not having much background knowledge of where the series has headed toward I still found this installment engaging enough to leave me wanting more especially since it ended on a cliffhanger of sorts even though it's yet another long wait before the third film hit the screens over here.Evangelion continues where we last left off in its cinematic version and the Earth is now under protection by the EVA robots around the world still piloted by children. There are plans now underway to be more humane though in piloting the EVAs like unmanned drones from afar thus keeping the kids out of harm's way. But then there are other plans brewing at sinister levels which only get hinted at here clearly sowing the seeds in this installment for something more to come in the future films.Elements from the earlier film have become staple and repeated such as the cheeky way the female characters always get portrayed in teasing the audience  fanboys with various states of dress  near wardrobe malfunction and hey besides lead character Shinji Ikari voiced by Megumi Ogata every one of his peer pilot seem to be female and in the opening we're introduced to the pilot for EVA No 5 to start off the film literally with a bang and EVA No 2's pilot Asuka Langley Shikinami Yuko Miyamura in her bright red robot and uniform in an instant confirming the suspicion that here's one hot chili who isn't afraid to speak her mind. I like this feisty character who brings a breath of fresh air from the quiet Rei Ayanami Megumi Hayashibara and Shinji's pessimism. Other elements would include the countless religious imagery which is now more inyourface and I suppose it should all make sense once the final film rolls around.The narrative found perfect balance to go a little deeper into the motivation of the various characters though the kid pilots leave more room as intended for future growth since Rei is a quiet enigma Shinji still being the reluctant hero and Asuka the livewire who doesn't mince her words even if criticizing her Japanese counterparts quite pointedly and in some ways offensively too. A large chunk of the story got devoted to a suggestion of a love triangle that didn't manage to play itself out due to the constant alien threat but got to a point enough to affect the events that follow and to make them a sledgehammer for emotions. Then there's the action sequences which are still as spectacular. The Angels' designs get weirder and their attack more powerful of course though the EVAs have a few more tricks up their sleeves brought about by really pushing the envelope beyond what has so far been permissible. With humans at the helm of technology we are always in control and can add that aspect of humanity without allowing technology itself from going berserk. This gets explored and discussed somewhat especially when a dummy module gets its field day when called upon to override some human inaction and I assure you your jaw will drop and how enemies get pulverized which is something which I least expected in an actionpacked yet moving scene which will get you all riled up. Then again this shows how important it is to have a human mind in control over something else which dictates its actions through set rules and executed without a soul of thought.As a follow up film this one lived up to the potential set by its predecessor and expanded upon that universe with more Evangelion protocols new and improved mecha capabilities and characters you feel for while still keeping a lid on the intrigue posed by the organizations NERV and Seele. No prior knowledge of the earlier film is required though you would be better off to know some basics to enjoy the film a lot more. Needless to say the fans would lap this up especially when the trailer for the 3rd film gets played after the end credits that offered that sneak peek into what's next and that antagonizing wait for it to actually happen.".

	schema:reviewBody "PARTIAL SPOILERS The first Rebuild of Evangelion You Are Not Alone a.k.a. Evangelion Shingekijoban Jo was essentially an upgraded distillation of the first six episodes of the original Shin Seiki Evangelion television series. Little was lost or added and key scenes were recreated shotforshot all the way down to the most famous fan service peekaboo angles.The second installation of the fourpart Rebuild series You Can Not Advance sets itself an almost impossible task To condense seven hours of the TV anime episodes 7 to 20 into a single 108minute feature.Continuing the tradition from the first Rebuild film upgrades are everywhere. Both the bombAngel Sahaquiel and the satellite defenses deployed against it are unfurled with aplomb and there's a fresh exhilaration to the Eva units desperately sprinting to the Angel's projected point of landfall.

Her Sohryu inexplicably replaced by Shikinami Asuka retains variants of a few of her most memorable scenes but her early arguments with Shinji feel forced and we lose delightful sequences like the synchronized battle against the splitting Angel Israfel. Asuka shows more depth more quickly than she did in the series but it feels as though she has to fight for every moment of screen time.Rather than bringing anything unique to the franchise new character Makinami Mari Illustrious seems to be little more than a bloodthirsty standin for Asuka. Where Asuka has been toned down Mari has gone overthetop and her scenes could just as easily have been written for the redheaded halfGerman girl.Sadly while the TV series had remarkably good incidental English if horrible incidental German You Can Not Advance opens with a lengthy sequence dubbed by English speakers who were clearly phoning it in. Kaji gives it his best shot but he's given lines that are well beyond the capabilities of seiyu Yamadera Koichi.Like its predecessor You Can Not Advance aims for nothing less than shockandawe. The lack of breathing time coupled with some wrenching twists to the original story enhance the intensity tenfold. Be sure to stick around until the end of the credits where you will find not only an ad for the next film but a very important concluding scene as well.".

	onyx:emotionText "PARTIAL SPOILERS The first Rebuild of Evangelion You Are Not Alone a.k.a. Evangelion Shingekijoban Jo was essentially an upgraded distillation of the first six episodes of the original Shin Seiki Evangelion television series. Little was lost or added and key scenes were recreated shotforshot all the way down to the most famous fan service peekaboo angles.The second installation of the fourpart Rebuild series You Can Not Advance sets itself an almost impossible task To condense seven hours of the TV anime episodes 7 to 20 into a single 108minute feature.Continuing the tradition from the first Rebuild film upgrades are everywhere. Both the bombAngel Sahaquiel and the satellite defenses deployed against it are unfurled with aplomb and there's a fresh exhilaration to the Eva units desperately sprinting to the Angel's projected point of landfall. The preamble to the battle against the infected Unit 3 has been shortened favoring instead an extended sequence of bloody desecration accompanied by a chillingly ironic selection of background music.

The rebuilds basically takes story archs from the series to make into a new movie with some new graphics new characters and new story arch. I found the new graphics and the new story arch very interesting as its faster pace and of course with new graphics. It also left out a lot of Shinji's self pitying patheticness which allowed me to actually connect with the story instead of trying not to throw up with disgust. The battle scenes are superb.

	schema:reviewBody "This review is based on the BluRay release version 2.22Evangelion 2.0 You Can Not Advance or 2.22 depending on the version you saw is the most successful interpretation of Evangelion thus far. While the first remake film 1.0 You Are Not Alone felt much like a mere recap of the first six episodes of the series the second film takes a different approach and reaches a remarkable level of success. Everything is smoother more refined and simply better.The animation is gorgeous. The plot is more understandable. The characters are actually all likable this time. Many elements of the story are different and the pretentious biblical gibberish seems to have taken a back seat. There is also warmth that was largely missing in the series the characters seem to be genuinely content with their lives. Shinji isn't constantly mumbling about hating himself. Rei isn't a completely emotionless robot. Even Gendo seems more human. As a very small but important detail we see his eyes through his shades far more than in the series which may not sound like much but it really makes a difference if you've watched the series.The story remains mostly the same. The events cover mostly what happens in the episodes 719 of the series but with all the filler cut out. Only the most meaningful angel battles are left. Instead of feeling episodic like the first film 2.0 actually feels like a proper movie with appropriate highs and lows and character development culminating in a huge climax which is one of the most exciting action sequences ever seen in animation.The animation is top of the class. The level of detail is simply eye popping especially when watched in HD. With the help of CGI the angel battles look cooler than ever and the evas are particularly impressive. The fairly simplistic characters are something of a letdown in comparison but don't drag the overall presentation down.The sound is also vastly improved from the series. The music this time is appropriately epic matching the scale and size of the evas and angels. The voice acting is on par with the series with most of the original cast reprising their roles. The ending song an acoustic version of Utada Hikaru's Beautiful World feels perfect for the film as if letting out a sigh of relief yet still leaving the feeling there's more to come.Yet there are still problems Evangelion can't seem to get rid of. The biblical imagery and names though downplayed in this film still feel somewhat goofy and superficial. Though the plot is more coherent it still is very weird and it can be hard to grasp what exactly the big picture is. There is some weird dialogue and lines like Do you hate pain?. Still the rest of the film is good enough that the viewer is willing to overlook most of the flaws.Evangelion 2.0 is the best interpretation of the series thus far and it left me eagerly waiting for more. I recommend seeing the 2.22 version as it gives more insight to the characters and story. Highly recommended for both fans of the series and newcomers alike.".

	schema:headline " 8.510  satisfying";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched Evangelion as a teenager and liked many aspects of it. However the series was very weak and repetitive in the middle and clearly suffered production difficulties near the end. The movies didn't do much for me after the initial epicscope aesthetics of End of Evangelion had worn off. Now more than 10 years later I'm pretty happy that things have been reordered and rerendered to make the series into what it should really have been in the first place.I don't like the fact than Anno Hideaki has been able to milk the somewhat unfinished series for so much cash and so many editions not to mention pachinko machines so far but taking 1.0 and 2.0 as standalone works and ignoring their pretentious titles is pretty satisfying.Story 810 Good much more than a rehash of the series. The story is fleshed out in some of the most necessary places and feels so much tighter and more concentrated than anything that has come before. Some awesome new snippets of what is to come later in the series add some satisfying excitement.However there is still an element of here comes the next baddie which gets a little tiresome. It is dealt with much more effectively here than the series but it's still predictable. Nevertheless despite giving the impression of being about to enter the fullon monster of the week barrage it never really does which is a blessed relief. The interactions of the characters are becoming more believable and individual personalities are being better exposed and explained.But and it's a necessary but what's the deal with the fanservice? Come on man. Take yourself seriously won't you? Animation 910 Well it teetered between absolutely superb and a little disappointing. The budget was clearly insanely high. Action sequences are fantastically detailed and choreographed for the main part although suffer from gratuitous flailing of limbs and ridiculous acrobats which unfortunately dumb it down a little. Backgrounds are simply amazing. The detail and range is incredible. The failings lie in the characters. Sometimes character faces and expressions look out of place by their simplicity. The broad pen pines and oversimple shading are a bit of a letdown.Sound 7.510 Not particularly amazing. Again we see the technique of using a mixture of classical and children's music for depth and vulnerability. I'm surprised at some of the choices though. For example one of the children's songs used is very popular in Japan and often used in elementary schools. The manner in which it is normally used makes its appearance in the film almost comical which can't have been the intention. Not really knowing many Japanese people who care that much about anime I haven't been able to ask what they though but it seemed a bit silly to me.The Japanese people speaking English throughout the film are incredibly embarrassing. What a huge miscalculation. How hard is it to train people to say a small number of lines in a natural way? Characters 8.5 Although some of the characters particularly Asuka seem to have become even less likable for the most part the bighitters have only improved. Although there is little time left for the minorcharacters to develop or even really be involved the welldeveloped personalities of the leads take somewhat new directions in their relations to one another. The relationship between teensap Shinji and his father has a more satisfying and somewhat relatable edge to it now and Rei's annoyingly hyperbolic meekness has been flatted out to something more forgiving. All in all satisfying.And the new lead Mari is much better than at least I predicted. She has a very interesting relationship with herself and pain. I am definitely looking forward to her future development.Eva designs seem to have changed slightly around the waist which was a curious choice and doesn't add much to their attractiveness. In contrast the Angels have been changed for the better. The old sometimes Ultramanish designs were sometimes a little... Ultramanish. The reduced number and better designs have helped things along well.Overall 8.510 Overall satisfying. For me the film didn't quite have the intensity ascribed to it by others and the ending I thought actually lacked a little emotional attachment. I also thought that the amazing animation and choreography discussed above wasn't nearly as good near the end as it was earlier in the feature. But despite this as a whole this movie blows the series out of the water. So much which was unsatisfactory is now shiny and new. Whether or not I would feel this way about the film without having seen the rest of the franchise is anyone's guess but I really enjoyed it. Good work keep it up.".

It is dealt with much more effectively here than the series but it's still predictable. Nevertheless despite giving the impression of being about to enter the fullon monster of the week barrage it never really does which is a blessed relief. The interactions of the characters are becoming more believable and individual personalities are being better exposed and explained.But and it's a necessary but what's the deal with the fanservice? Come on man. Take yourself seriously won't you? Animation 910 Well it teetered between absolutely superb and a little disappointing. The budget was clearly insanely high. Action sequences are fantastically detailed and choreographed for the main part although suffer from gratuitous flailing of limbs and ridiculous acrobats which unfortunately dumb it down a little. Backgrounds are simply amazing. The detail and range is incredible. The failings lie in the characters. Sometimes character faces and expressions look out of place by their simplicity. The broad pen pines and oversimple shading are a bit of a letdown.Sound 7.510 Not particularly amazing. Again we see the technique of using a mixture of classical and children's music for depth and vulnerability. I'm surprised at some of the choices though. For example one of the children's songs used is very popular in Japan and often used in elementary schools. The manner in which it is normally used makes its appearance in the film almost comical which can't have been the intention. Not really knowing many Japanese people who care that much about anime I haven't been able to ask what they though but it seemed a bit silly to me.The Japanese people speaking English throughout the film are incredibly embarrassing. What a huge miscalculation. How hard is it to train people to say a small number of lines in a natural way? Characters 8.5 Although some of the characters particularly Asuka seem to have become even less likable for the most part the bighitters have only improved. Although there is little time left for the minorcharacters to develop or even really be involved the welldeveloped personalities of the leads take somewhat new directions in their relations to one another. The relationship between teensap Shinji and his father has a more satisfying and somewhat relatable edge to it now and Rei's annoyingly hyperbolic meekness has been flatted out to something more forgiving. All in all satisfying.And the new lead Mari is much better than at least I predicted. She has a very interesting relationship with herself and pain. I am definitely looking forward to her future development.Eva designs seem to have changed slightly around the waist which was a curious choice and doesn't add much to their attractiveness. In contrast the Angels have been changed for the better. The old sometimes Ultramanish designs were sometimes a little... Ultramanish. The reduced number and better designs have helped things along well.Overall 8.510 Overall satisfying. For me the film didn't quite have the intensity ascribed to it by others and the ending I thought actually lacked a little emotional attachment. I also thought that the amazing animation and choreography discussed above wasn't nearly as good near the end as it was earlier in the feature. But despite this as a whole this movie blows the series out of the water. So much which was unsatisfactory is now shiny and new. Whether or not I would feel this way about the film without having seen the rest of the franchise is anyone's guess but I really enjoyed it. Good work keep it up.";

	schema:reviewBody "Thats just it. Awesome.The first rebuild movie just sort of retold the first six or so episodes of the original series. It looked great but you could never shake the feeling of been there seen it except for the improved Angels obviously This one goes far far beyond that. It sums up the plot of episode seven up to something around twenty. Thus it seems a little bit rushed but on the flip side you're never able to catch your breath. The visuals are breathtaking at moments. The Angels are pretty much unrecognizable from their predecessors which is a good thing in my opinion and simply gorgeous to behold. The score also knows how to please.Where the movie really shines though is the story department. Instead of a retelling we get a reimagining. Starting with a completely new character piloting EVA05 and ending with a quite different... well ending. Its like they mixed the original episodes with End of Evangelion. While many scenes are still recognizable they are often arranged differently or put into a completely different context. More than that the movie strays from the source in quite a view key elements and reveals a lot of things far far earlier than the original series. Also it explains far far more. At the end of the ride you will have a pretty decent idea what the Human Instrumentality Plan is for example. Something the original series didn't really bother to explain at all. There are completely new parts to the story as well. It's true that Asukas character falls a little short on screen time but all in all I like her much better here than in the series. Her story ark and thus her development feels rushed but is still solid and the ending is one of the biggest twists in this movie. And in the end... there are two movies left I think and the way Asukas story goes in this one she's fated to take on a much bigger role in future installments. In general the three children show new sides to them that were only hinted at before. Especially Rei gets a whole subplot that will definitely please fans of the character.All of this combined keeps you on the edge the whole time. You simply don't quite know where its headed. At the end of this second of four movies we have almost reached the end of the series which really makes me hope for an original very different outcome than before. Besides... the series was almost over at this point but with the movies we're only halfway there.In conclusion. If you liked EVA and you're not a nitpicker you're gonna love this. It's a hell of a ride. Don't miss it.".

I'll try to speak minimal spoilers and be brief as possible.The Evangelion 2.0 or Evangelion 2.22 in American English and Brazilian versions is a new concept of the story of Evangelion. For those who were used to Evangelion series this movie really breaks with the old series with an entirely new plot and a new course of actions during the movie. We got 2 new characters who makes this movie great and they are Mari Illustrious Makinami and Asuka Langley Shikinami. With a great sense of humor and something crazy Mari shows great movements and great battles which is great for a whole new character who had never appeared before in this series. Asuka has gotten a new design and a new personality that really thrown me inside the movie. Differently from the Asuka from the anime this Asuka shows a little more maturity and also some optimism what breaks that atmosphere dark and pessimistic what the original series had.At last Shinji also got a further development of his personality in this movie showing a more brave fearless and determined Shinji than the one of the series who was coward pathetic and depressive. As a sequel from Evangelion 1.0 this movie was really great with the good things the anime had like the amazingly designed battles and the fantastic soundtrack and the new included features that improved the plot and the characters. For anyone who has seen the original series and the Evangelion 1.0 this sequel is astounding and makes everyone to wish to see the 3rd part with high expectations for the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "First I'm not a good English speaker at all so please do not mind my English mistakes.So let's talk about the movie. Different from 1.0 You are not alone this one is very different from the original series. The changes go from the plot to the personality of the characters.Putting it in a nutshell the original series had a more obscure concept with melancholic dialog music and the characters themselves. I feel 2.0 You can not advance has a bit more cheerful and childish atmosphere that I'm not sure if I can describe by words. First the modified nature of the characters they open up way more than in the original series. Even Rei and Asukawhich has a different surname now wut? have heartwarming dialogues about themselves with Gendo and Misato. Gendo himself is a bit more sincere with himself. There's a scene where he even accepts having a dinner with Shinji after being convinced by wow Rei. Despite the characters the insert songs are very different now  in the original series we had serious and melancholic classical songsmost from baroque period for example Bach Handel and Pachelbel which gave the series a real serious tone. However the two insert songs in 2.0 Tsubasa Kudasai and Kyou no hi wa sayonara have an childish atmosphere and even sound like a group of kids is singing it which adds to the new innocent concept involving the characters contrasting with the powerful and even grotesque scenes. The first time I watched the new scenes where those songs play I felt a bit uncomfortable for a moment but soon I realized that it matched pretty well with the whole concept. As far as animation goes I don't have much to talk about. The animation is a masterpiece and it is the best I've seen so far the EVA's look damn badass and the angels look like a damn demon. The dubbing as expected is as good as it was in the original series. The whole cast is the same and the seiyu for the new character Mari Illustrious Makinami is very good. Talking about Mari it isn't clear yet why she is there. She has little screen time but every time she appears on screen she's a show stealer. But yet we don't know much about her and I'm sure it will be dealt with in the next movie.Now for the plot as I said it's very different from the original series. There's more of a political aspect and the movie tries to work with international affairs and it works very well since this movie tries to show up the post apocalyptic world in a better way than the previous series there are not lively scenes of Tokyo3 showing how people are living there now. There's even a sequence where Kaji takes the children to a place where they simulate how the ocean was before the second impact and the forms of live that lived on it. It's a neat way to connect the two realities and the consequences and prices of mankind's wisdom. Back to the plot there's now a Eva05 that is destroyed by an angel in United States apparently in the opening scene. Also Seele is developing the ultimate Evangelion unit Mark06 wtf is this name in a base located on the moon. also a neat way to give the movie a more modern touch. Apparently Kaworu will be the pilot for this one which blows my mind. The movie ends with probably the most melodramatic and romantic scene that was ever been signed under the name of Evangelion Shinji tries to save Rei from a angel that absorbed her and Eva00. This is one scene where you have to let reality run outside of your window and relax  preferably with a good beer in your hand  and is the climax of the movie resulting on a very powerful and touching scene.But anyway I could talk about this movie all day but you should watch it to make up your own opinions. I really recommend it it's a great masterpiece that will be talked about for a long time!NGE forever!".

	schema:headline " Evangelion 2.22";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that after the first film in this new 'Rebuild of Evangelion' cycle I had extremely low expectations for the second film. 1.11 was such a carbon copy of the 1995 series that I was convinced that Anno and the crew at Gainax were content to simply cash in on remaining fan fervor and release a mildly rehashed version of that admittedly brilliant storyline.The first 10 minutes of 2.22 utterly destroyed this preconception and left me breathless in my seat. This is one of the most fantastic opening sequences I've seen in film and sets the stage for a thrilling experience. 'You Can Not Advance' opens with the introduction of a new character a new EVA a new Angel and a new scenario and proceeds to evolve the storyline in a completely unpredictable fashion.People who think they 'know' Eva are going to be knocked on their asses by this film. Nearly everything has been upgraded for the better from the stunning visuals to the revamped plot line to the compelling musical score Shiroh Sagisu at the absolute pinnacle of his game. It's breathless and fastpaced and a very compelling movie experience.Which brings me to my one big gripe about the film it may be a little TOO entertaining. The original TV series was filled with tortuous selfdoubt and selfloathing an introspective psychoanalytical and quasireligious experience set to the background of giant robot combat for human survival. The new films streamline this so much seemingly for the sake of watchability that they lose a key part of what really made the series so engrossing at least for longtime fans like myself.To give one big example Shinji's ambiguous relationship with the 3 women in his life Misato Asuka and Rei is a huge aspect of the original series. He is continuously torn apart by his mix of adolescent sexual desire desire for friendship and desire for a motherfigure with regards to each of them. This is an underlying current throughout the series and becomes a real driving force in the original theatrical climax 'Air' and 'My Pure Heart for You'. In the 'Rebuild' storyline this is reimagined as a much simpler developing romance between Shinji and Rei with Asuka's onesided affections filling out a rudimentary triangle her character in the new film is such a 180 that it's difficult to accept. While much easier to understand and certainly less angstridden I do find this resort to a familiar trope to be a bit of a disappointment especially when compared with the original storyline.In spite of these minor quibbles this is a film that really must be seen by anyone who has even a passing interest in Japanese animation or film in general and if possible you should try and catch it during its US theatrical run in January. Just don't take this as the 'definitive' Eva.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have to admit that after the first film in this new 'Rebuild of Evangelion' cycle I had extremely low expectations for the second film. 1.11 was such a carbon copy of the 1995 series that I was convinced that Anno and the crew at Gainax were content to simply cash in on remaining fan fervor and release a mildly rehashed version of that admittedly brilliant storyline.The first 10 minutes of 2.22 utterly destroyed this preconception and left me breathless in my seat. This is one of the most fantastic opening sequences I've seen in film and sets the stage for a thrilling experience. 'You Can Not Advance' opens with the introduction of a new character a new EVA a new Angel and a new scenario and proceeds to evolve the storyline in a completely unpredictable fashion.People who think they 'know' Eva are going to be knocked on their asses by this film. Nearly everything has been upgraded for the better from the stunning visuals to the revamped plot line to the compelling musical score Shiroh Sagisu at the absolute pinnacle of his game. It's breathless and fastpaced and a very compelling movie experience.Which brings me to my one big gripe about the film it may be a little TOO entertaining. The original TV series was filled with tortuous selfdoubt and selfloathing an introspective psychoanalytical and quasireligious experience set to the background of giant robot combat for human survival. The new films streamline this so much seemingly for the sake of watchability that they lose a key part of what really made the series so engrossing at least for longtime fans like myself.To give one big example Shinji's ambiguous relationship with the 3 women in his life Misato Asuka and Rei is a huge aspect of the original series. He is continuously torn apart by his mix of adolescent sexual desire desire for friendship and desire for a motherfigure with regards to each of them. This is an underlying current throughout the series and becomes a real driving force in the original theatrical climax 'Air' and 'My Pure Heart for You'. In the 'Rebuild' storyline this is reimagined as a much simpler developing romance between Shinji and Rei with Asuka's onesided affections filling out a rudimentary triangle her character in the new film is such a 180 that it's difficult to accept. While much easier to understand and certainly less angstridden I do find this resort to a familiar trope to be a bit of a disappointment especially when compared with the original storyline.In spite of these minor quibbles this is a film that really must be seen by anyone who has even a passing interest in Japanese animation or film in general and if possible you should try and catch it during its US theatrical run in January. Just don't take this as the 'definitive' Eva.";

This movie features more of the angels being destroyed and it actually ends by saying Third Impact has occurred! That was quite a shock to me! I had no idea there would be such a divergence from the original anime. This movie was probably the best film for Giant Monster Month seeing as how it introduced the character Asuka. We even get a brand new original character for the franchise Mari. Mari is a very fun character in that she is very strong and a lot more pleasant than Asuka.There's a lot of this film that does seem like padding. These scenes are still great because we get to see the characters interact. Here we have pretty much all the original characters together and talking. It's great to see how they play off of each other. This is what any movie with a large cast should be doing. Well it's not that large but it has many recognizable characters. I like the previews they do at the end of these movies. It helps that the animation is absolutely gorgeous. I guess Japan didn't need to switch to exclusive CGI theatrically released cartoons. 12".

The best character in this movie handsdown is Shinji. Near the end I paused the movie and went WHY IS SHINJI NOT ACTING LIKE HIMSELF???!!! because he was showing courage and ability to stay in one place. This is an insane improvement for Shinji because in NGE he is always having anxiety attacks and running away. He provided us with one hell of a climax and the want to pick up the next movie right away to see what happens.The action is a lot better this time around because there are people who can actually fight angels coughAuskacough which makes the movie fast paced and interesting. There is this one scene with the dummy system later in the movie who goes to town on a angel and shows that while useful only humans can pilot EVA's or TOO much damage will be done. IN conclusion I like this movie a lot. It has good characters great action and a ending you will never forget. Plus Shinji isn't a pussy.".

If you have followed the series and would like to know who the pilot is and why she is here or possibly answer questions left from the original series....Do not expect any of this to be explained.The original series certainly suffered from periods of inactivity shots that go on for way to long and confusing sequences which it compensated for with wonderfully done battle scenes. This movie does do away with those unnecessary long scenes and attempts to compress the story in between rapidly occurring battles. However these battles to me simply did not have the intensity that built up in the series nor were as interesting as the ones featured in the other movie. Ultimately the fight scenes came across as rushed copies.Finally I did not enjoy the music. The orchestrated score fit well into the movie but the translated Japanese pop songs seemed to make certain scenes grind on.Overall I found this movie to be lacking in Story telling of any sort.

But this was a failed attempt to modify an already flawed series and making it worse by changing some of the characters and the animation while deciding to make a 2hour long franchise of movies to try to squeeze in all the depth of the series.Asuka has changed from a depressed kid with mommy issues to a wise talking gossiper with an aloof personality.

And Asuka has replaced Toji in being Eva 3.0's pilot. Which caused me to drop it and I had enough of seeing my favorite character tortured.Shinji's face is too goofylooking for me but other than that the updated animation is kind of special to watch but the series is a little too old to be remaking so that we can use this style of animation. Unless they can try to find a way to use animation that's closer to the original series.Now I watched this before I watched Kare Kano but when I watched it I noticed that its music has been copied onto here making it unoriginal.

This may in no small way be due to the Director Jag Mundhra who should be pleased with the finished film.Watching the film it kinda struck me that its the kind of film that seems to have gone out of fashion. An intelligent entertaining that might be the incorrect word in view of the subject matter issue film that doesn't patronise its audience. This is easily Aishwarya Rai best WesternEnglish Language film to date and could mark the start of an interesting phase in her career. Cast to my mind against type she plays Kiranjit Ahluwalia a battered Housewife who after years of Physical Mental  Sexual abuse kills her husband by setting fire to him while he sleeps. Kiranjit would later be jailed for life for murder and then successfully appeal the decision and in doing so change English Criminal Law.I must say that Aishwarya really did show there's more to her than her looks. If you've seen her other English Languauge films this is a complete step up performance wise. Especially when you ask yourself who would you get to play an Indian Battered wife I'm sure like me you wouldn't have cast Ms. Rai in a Million years based on seeing Mistress of Spices  Bride and Prejudice respectively.Aishwarya gives a really good performance she managing to convey the fact that she Kiranjit is supposed to be a good wife  mother so if her husband abuses her if must be her fault. But Ms. Rai is really at her best when she has killed her husband and is in something of a daze with the whole enormity of the situation. She really manages to have you believing this is how the real Kiranjit acted. An important subject handled intelligently I can't recommend this film highly enough.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Provoked";
	schema:reviewBody "There were two reasons why I had decided to catch this film and they are the beautiful Aishwarya Rai and composer extraordinaire A. R. Rahman. Provoked is based on the true story of Kiranjit Ahluwalia whose autobiographical book Circle of Light forms the basis of this movie. However its textbook delivery style resulted in a film that's quite plain despite its powerful potential in examining domestic violence against women.Rai plays the protagonist Kiranjit a Punjabi woman instructed by culture and social norms to be the dutiful wife to Deepak Ahluwalia Naveen Andrews who whisks her off to London. Kiranjit doesn't know what she's in for as it's an arranged marriage and soon enough the true colours of her spouse start to show  the drinking the womanizing and the verbal physical emotional abuses. For 10 years she tolerated and suffered until one night she snapped and gave her husband his just desserts. We're talking about the law here and so she gets sent to the slammer.Then on it's split down a few paths. Along one path iIt's like Prison on Fire where glimpses of the harsh realities of the world inside with criminals start to harden Kiranjit to fend for herself along with the making of new friends and sisters. On another path the courtroom drama which was pivotal given that it's a landmark case which debated upon the fine definition of provocation somehow got delivered quite blandly no doubt because attention was drawn toward the very British courtroom with its wigs and polite legal language. And finally the path of melodrama and flashbacks used ad nauseam here in telling the abuse that Kiranjit had to endure. I'm gonna be biased here to say that Aishwarya Rai's performance is probably the best thing in the movie. As in Mistress of Spice those eyes can speak a thousand words with just a flicker a movement or a blink. And she can do unglam too sans thick makeup and making prison garb fashionable. As an abused woman you can't help but feel sorry for her and very much root for her to get herself out of her plight using whatever means possible. Nothing too breakthrough but she's as effective as can be.Unfortunately bad acting plagued most of the supporting cast. Naveen Andrews as the husband Deepak only managed to look snarling but is never menacing enough and the rest seemed to have been sleepwalking in part being let down by the lack of meat in these roles being in true one dimensional fashion. Only Miranda Richardson's fellow jailbird and cellmate Veronica Scott offered some balance in the acting department opposite Rai.Veteran director Jag Muhdhra seemed to have a bad outing trying to polish the film into the gem it should be and certain scenes were badly edited that they seemed to be pasted side by side without much thought to gel them together smoothly. It seemed to have dwelled too much in the beginning and felt hurried toward the end. It also lacked details of the rationale and failed to pound deeper into the heart of the subject. Rather what we got was a brief introduction and explanation of the topic followed by a very quick superficial resolution leaving us wanting more. A. R. Rahman's score seemed to have disappeared into the background at times though when it's on you can always ensure a treat for the ears.Perhaps that's the point of enticing the audience to pick up the book to read first hand the plight of someone being abused and the challenges faced in being a mother from within a cell battling innate customs and expectations to come out from within a shell and into the open not only to try and save oneself but to be a beacon of hope for many others in the same boat.Straight to the point no frills storytelling recommended for the curious and for those who want a launching point into a hot subject of abusive relationships.".

	schema:headline " Thought Provoking and Superbly WellActed!";
	schema:reviewBody "This ought to silence the critics! She gave you aweinspiring performances in Chokher Bali Guru Raincoat Kandukondain Kandukondain Devdas Umrao Jaan Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam just to mention a few. But if you still had your doubts about Aishwarya Rai's versatility as an actress then go watch her bring down the house in the thought provoking weepfest known as Provoked. Add another feather to the woman's hat she truly is a powerhouse performer finally coming into her own. Please ignore all the naysayers who have been detracting about her accent in the film her character learnt English from a British woman how else do you expect her to speak? I mean come on people!In a nutshell most people who went to see this already knew the story Provoked is the journey of an emotionally psychologically and physically battered woman from the depths of despair to the glory and grace of emancipation. Rai plays Kiranjit Ahluwalia the virginal Punjabi mailorderbride brought to London to wed Deepak Ahluwaliaplayed intensely well by the uptopar Naveen Andrews. She is quick to discover that her fears have been confirmed when her initiation into abuse begins on her wedding night. We discover albeit in flashback that Kiranjit was skeptical about marrying this man she neither knew nor loved but was coerced by a band of family and friends to tie the knot which she reluctantly did. It isn't long until Deepak begins cheating on her insulting her beating her raping her and you just think of anything remotely and grotesquely inhumane and I'm sure Deepak Ahluwalia does it to his wife. Truly despicable!The film itself begins with that very headlining scene I'm sure everybody shuddered to even conceive of when they first heard about the Kiranjit saga. Asian wife sets husband ablaze while he sleeps. The camera quivers as it leads a pair of hands bearing a bucket and a lit candle in either hand walking towards an isolated room in a dimly lit house. We do not see anything of Kiranjit until she does the deed and Deepak begins to howl in horror running HelterSkelter eventually ending up on the front lawn where a neighbour runs out to his aid. This was the beginning of the end. Kiranjit in a state of shock then walks over to a neighbouring stoop in a daze sits there cuddling her two sons as she waits for the police to arrive. Provoked is very psychological when we first meet Kiranjit she is a woman of very little words so the audience has to do the extra work of reading meaning into her gestures expressions and angst. Her face implores the camera beckoning daring even for you put yourself in her shoes. Personally I started crying five minutes into Provoked and didn't stop until the very last words were spoken by Kiranjit at the end of the film. It is such a movie. Nobody should have to go through such hell.That said I know that the filmmaker's perspective is very controversial. The case itself was very controversial. There are several nuances in the film several things that are hinted at but not directly attacked or addressed. It definitely is pointing the finger but I'm not going to take sides. Which is why I've told many people who've asked me how the film was that it's not for everyone. I can see how Punjabi people would be offended by many elements in the film many aspects of it. I can see why a film like this wouldn't be 1 at the boxoffice. It's bawdy it's brilliant it's gritty it's raw it's realistic and most importantly it DOES NOT glamorize the story it is telling.A series of catastrophic eventsstemming from corrupt police officials lazy barristers evil motherinlaw and shady witnesses just to mention a few eventually land Kiranjit in jail and it is there in this new kind of hell that she truly is liberated. Rai plays Kiranjit to the pulp delicately enough as not to batter her. In the beginning she barely spoke a word of English so much so that in the flashback scenes whenever her husband spoke to her in English she would always revert to speaking Punjabi in response.

	onyx:emotionText "This ought to silence the critics! She gave you aweinspiring performances in Chokher Bali Guru Raincoat Kandukondain Kandukondain Devdas Umrao Jaan Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam just to mention a few. But if you still had your doubts about Aishwarya Rai's versatility as an actress then go watch her bring down the house in the thought provoking weepfest known as Provoked. Add another feather to the woman's hat she truly is a powerhouse performer finally coming into her own. Please ignore all the naysayers who have been detracting about her accent in the film her character learnt English from a British woman how else do you expect her to speak? I mean come on people!In a nutshell most people who went to see this already knew the story Provoked is the journey of an emotionally psychologically and physically battered woman from the depths of despair to the glory and grace of emancipation. Rai plays Kiranjit Ahluwalia the virginal Punjabi mailorderbride brought to London to wed Deepak Ahluwaliaplayed intensely well by the uptopar Naveen Andrews. She is quick to discover that her fears have been confirmed when her initiation into abuse begins on her wedding night. We discover albeit in flashback that Kiranjit was skeptical about marrying this man she neither knew nor loved but was coerced by a band of family and friends to tie the knot which she reluctantly did. It isn't long until Deepak begins cheating on her insulting her beating her raping her and you just think of anything remotely and grotesquely inhumane and I'm sure Deepak Ahluwalia does it to his wife. Truly despicable!The film itself begins with that very headlining scene I'm sure everybody shuddered to even conceive of when they first heard about the Kiranjit saga. Asian wife sets husband ablaze while he sleeps. The camera quivers as it leads a pair of hands bearing a bucket and a lit candle in either hand walking towards an isolated room in a dimly lit house. We do not see anything of Kiranjit until she does the deed and Deepak begins to howl in horror running HelterSkelter eventually ending up on the front lawn where a neighbour runs out to his aid. This was the beginning of the end. Kiranjit in a state of shock then walks over to a neighbouring stoop in a daze sits there cuddling her two sons as she waits for the police to arrive. Provoked is very psychological when we first meet Kiranjit she is a woman of very little words so the audience has to do the extra work of reading meaning into her gestures expressions and angst. Her face implores the camera beckoning daring even for you put yourself in her shoes. Personally I started crying five minutes into Provoked and didn't stop until the very last words were spoken by Kiranjit at the end of the film. It is such a movie. Nobody should have to go through such hell.That said I know that the filmmaker's perspective is very controversial. The case itself was very controversial. There are several nuances in the film several things that are hinted at but not directly attacked or addressed. It definitely is pointing the finger but I'm not going to take sides. Which is why I've told many people who've asked me how the film was that it's not for everyone. I can see how Punjabi people would be offended by many elements in the film many aspects of it. I can see why a film like this wouldn't be 1 at the boxoffice. It's bawdy it's brilliant it's gritty it's raw it's realistic and most importantly it DOES NOT glamorize the story it is telling.A series of catastrophic eventsstemming from corrupt police officials lazy barristers evil motherinlaw and shady witnesses just to mention a few eventually land Kiranjit in jail and it is there in this new kind of hell that she truly is liberated. Rai plays Kiranjit to the pulp delicately enough as not to batter her. In the beginning she barely spoke a word of English so much so that in the flashback scenes whenever her husband spoke to her in English she would always revert to speaking Punjabi in response. But in jail she meets Veronica ScottPlayed by the spectacular Miranda Richardson her cell mate who becomes one of the bestfriends and sort of a guardian angel who helps her find herself and achieve so much as an independent woman. Nandita Das plays Radha Dalal a fireball twentysomething leader of the Black sisters radicals hellbent springing Kiranjit from jail. Robbie Coltrane Harry Potter's Hagrid turns in a great performance as Kiranjit second barrister Lord Edward Foster. Steve Mcfadden Nicholas Irons and Raji James among others round out the stellar supporting cast. So many familiar faces!

The courts could never find a woman who had burnt her husband to death to be innocent. So on September 25th 1992  they reduced her sentence to manslaughter and accepted her 3 years 4 months that she'd spent in jail as the full term. I guess this summarizes my argument against this review. No Kiranjeet was not innocent. She lost her reason after 10 years of rape abuse physical and emotional  and snapped one night.As to whether her action was justified  will again quote from the movie For a woman who suffered violence and abuse of the highest order for 10 long years and feared not only for her own life but the life of her little children  I myself could not would not presume to know what reasonable would be for such a woman.The real issue here is that some men need to learn to treat women with honor. Though I will grant there were some real cheesy moments of womentowomen bonding in the prison  don't know how much of that is real.I am a punjabi male and found this movie perfectly fine  there is no negative bias against men  unless of course you're one of those men who think it's a good idea to iron your spouse just for the kicks.

It is the shock value that worked for many as they did not see it coming read Aishwarya minus the plastic glam. If I was Naveen Andrews I would have been kicking myself for doing this movie. He is way too talented and looked like doing a favour to the makers by accepting the role.The story had all the ingredients of becoming an earth shattering revolutionary drama. What instead it ended up being is neither a documentary nor a drama. It is true that the makers wanted to stick to the truth and do justice to the book I have not read it. While trying to achieve that they forgot what viewers were there for. There was no soul behind any scene. No character development. I could not connect to Kiranjit's pain. Art direction looked dated. Dialogues esp. in the courtroom and jail scenes sounded very amateurish.It had possibly the worst ending with the protagonist looking straight into the camera and delivering a preachy speech. That is the last thing the enterprise needed. Overall a below average product which leaves an awkward taste that one usually gets after biting into any half baked stale food.".

This story is about a woman who gets beat up by her husband and kills him for that. She goes into prison.This should be a true story but is not believable because of the worse acting and appearance of Aishwaria. Aish's acting is horrible! Besides that the language spoken is English. But I could not understand some people because they were talking not clearly. Like the boss of the police. When he talks even the subtitles don't understand what the guy is saying. And the dutch subtitles in Bollywood movies are very bad. I think they are translated by a computer or something.Every time when Aishwaria Rai is saying I'm sorry the subtitles say I'm sad. It does not make any sense. Even the English subtitles are not correct.Okay I cannot judge a movie by the subtitles because in most bollywood movie the subtitles don't work proper. The way the movie is made makes women who watch the movie wonder to kill her husbands when they hit them even once.Or when a husband shouts at his wife once he should hide all candles and matches otherwise he gets burnt. Like all women are victims. And so what if you kill your husband? Prison life is great! You meet a lot of female friends who will help you climb up your way to get free. Because when your husband hits you you must not run away no you must kill him! Come on! Who made up this crap? And why do independent women have short hair like men? The woman who wants to fight for Aish's rights has short hair. She is not female because she does a man's job? The should have given her role to Aishwaria and vice versa. But the other woman is not a celebrity and not pretty with short hair. That fact is in her way for fame. Yes she cannot act but Aishwaria cannot act either. She is only pretty like the horrible actress Priyanka Chopra.In Bollywood there is one major thing if you know the right people in your family then you will become famous in movies. It doesn't matter if you can act or not.".

In the movie Deepak is shown as a caring husband one moment and a violent abuser the next. No time or effort is spend in the movie to show the transformation from one to another. People don't act randomly that way. What was the root cause of change in Deepak? Generally when marriage break down to this extent it is usually due to both partners rarely due to just one person. Also do two wrongs make a right?? Why did she not leave her husband while all of the abuse was happening? Why not call cops after one incident while he as sleeping drunk or confess beating to the RNDr at the hospital? I mean shouldn't one attempt these before burning someone alive? Honestly I cannot condone burning someone alive no matter what given that it was premeditated and caustic soda was added to the mix to cook the meat. It is easy to sympathize with the character because she is played wonderfully by Ash but I would sympathize with her if she acts with the ultravulnerable innocent puppy look like she does in the movie even if she kills the pope. Also the Radha character was quite rude and annoying. All she did was shout out ridiculous and disgusting to Kiran's attorney and judge like that will help their cause. She probably saw her brotherinlaw in every abuser justified or not. And the jailhouse bonding were all over dramatic. Melodrama should have no place in movie dealing with a delicate topic like this one. Other than Ash this movie is not even worthy of one look...".

It's the highlight of the film as the stock footage suggests we are no longer watching a DC3 but rather a Kamikaze plane in a ball of fire rapidly dropping from the sky into a raging sea. The fact that they all manage to survive almost confirms the amazing optimism expressed by the girls manager back on shore where he tells a distressed relative on the phone No need to fear the worse all we know is the plane caught fire and we lost radio contact.OK I think its best come clean and reveal that the real horror of Spider Island is the appalling overdubbing of the voices. In fact after a while you start listening to the secondary sound effects to see if they are as equally bad. I particularly like a scene where someone is showering in a waterfall but the actual sound effect is that of someone gargling water. So the film does manage in this way to keep your interest.And in a strange way as the plot and women begin to be revealed you begin to wonder what will happen next only because you know it will not be logical and probably will involve women fighting. And the women are great a flash back to when buxom was in women could really catfight and they had no trouble in throwing themselves shamelessly at an ordinary man.So overall a few agreeable moments for the bad film buff. In particular I suggest you watch out early on for the logical jump when they find an extendedhandle hammer and the guy concludes Ahh an extendedhandle hammer they must be mining uranium. Now as well known in bad film land uranium is the universal cause of giant nasty animals so you are ready for big spiders to start appearing. Yet in this film uranium also seems to be an aphrodisiac making the extendedhandle hammer metaphor even more poignant.This movie was on the Treeline 50 scifi classics compilation  I suspect it is not readily available as a single release. The type of film you wouldn't seek to watch but if you are stuck on the lounge after a heavy pizza and it came on you probably would end up watching it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Silly stupid bad acting worse dubbing nonexistent plot...I liked this movie!Manly and ruggedly handsome Gary and his sweet and shrewd girlfriend Georgia are taking a team of dancing girls down to Singapore. Too bad their plane catches fire and slams into the ocean at full speed. Miraculously Gary Georgia and most of the dancers survive this horrific accident with not a broken limb or even a bruise in sight. They wash up on an uncharted desert isle and find a cabin containing a corpse hanging in a giant spider web. Momentarily upset they soon shrug it off and strip down to their underwear while a sultry sax plays. Gary wanders off into the stormy night after Georgia catches him playing tongue wars with one of the sluttier dancers. He never returns. Georgia and the other girls are now alone on the island...or are they? Some unknown menace strangles the slut and then disappears again leaving the rest of the girls to go skinny dipping and wrestle each other in their underwear. When a small boat arrives carrying the partners of the dead man in the web there's time for a wild dance party and lots of making out before sailing home. Unfortunately Gary has been waiting all this time having done nothing but hide inside of a tree for the entire middle of the movie and makes his appearance on this last night ready to wreak bloody carnage! Gary has been bitten by a mutant spider and is now one himself...sort of. Actually he looks kind of like Neanderthal Man with glue on vampire fangs but we're supposed to believe that he is now a spider monster! The horror elements of this film seemed almost an afterthought thrown in to attract a larger crowd. Really this is just an exploitation film featuring lots of curvy young women gadding about in their underthings dancing catfighting swimming bathing and seducing the young men who find them. It's a terrible movie but it's amusing nonetheless. If you like cheap exploitation and aren't picky about things like plot then you'll enjoy this one. It's a really poor man's Russ Meyer film...with spiders!".

	schema:headline " A very entertaining piece of junk";
	schema:reviewBody "This West German production is a bonafide trash classic. It's monumentally silly but hugely enjoyable. It concerns a troupe of female dancers and their manager whose plane crash lands in the ocean leaving them stranded on a desert island. This island is rich in uranium resulting in the mutation of a spider into a large alienlike creature whose bite turns an unfortunate victim into a werewolflike spidermonster.This is an early entry in the sexploitation genre seeing as a large part of its running time is made up of scantilyclad women dancing fighting arguing and running away. Obviously it's now pretty tame stuff but that doesn't stop it from being a lot of fun. The women have a host of crazy accents as a result of the dubbing in the movie. Perhaps something was lost in the translation? Maybe so. But an awful lot was gained by it in terms of general hilarity. The dialogue in this film is pure crapola gold. Like when shortly after arriving at the island the manager finds a hammer and says something to the effect of 'a hammerand with a long handlethat must mean miningmost probably for uranium!' Brilliant. It certainly removes the need for any further exposition. Another classic line occurs when the girls find one of their party dead and one of the women opines 'she must have been strangled by the spider'. Yeah that IS the first thing one would assume isn't it? A spider that can strangle you. As it turns out it is yet another quite brilliant guess by our heroes as the spider is indeed capable of strangulation seeing as it has little hands. And a funny evil face. I am quite badly arachnophobic but I was quite fond of this particular giant spider and was a little sad to see him killed early on in the film. Yes that's correct The Horrors of Spider Island only has one spider. And his screentime must be all of 30 seconds. In most 60's scifi horror schlock such a lack of screentime for the central monster would be a disaster as these films would be padded out with boring dialogue. Not in the case of this movie. It simply finds other ways to entertain via the hilarious spidermonster called Gary and the bitching women and the loveinterest geologists who turn up. The geologists are two guys who arrive and cause the dancers to immediately fall in love and fight over them for no discernible reason. Furthermore when one of the ladies asks one of these chaps to say something nice to her he replies with no irony 'well I'm really glad that your aeroplane crashed'. Ah romance. Anyway these two blockheads hold their own in the entertainment stakes for example at one point they argue and decide to have a fight but one of them insists that if they have to have a punchup it must be indoors! So they go inside and proceed to knock each other about in the process knocking over every prop in the room. So unnecessary so funny.This is definitely recommended. Trash enthusiasts will lap this one up. Where quite a few bad 60's scifi horrors disappoint and ultimately fall flat this one delivers the goods. You'd be clinically mad to take this seriously so instead sit back and enjoy a quite brilliant slice of rubbish.".

I guess the nice people of Singapore needed evidence of a morally bankrupt society before they went with their fundamental Islamic state.  Anyhow the girls are more seriously threatened by one of the guys who comes to rescue them.  There's a dead professor some uranium and this mutant spider that's about the size of the Taco Bell dog who tries to strangle people.  The only problem is there's more scenes of women wiggling than there is of the spider that's causing all the horror.It's obvious what the real purpose of the movie is when one of the dancers says Ohhh it's SOOOOO hot! and then begins to strip for the camera. Notice also that the dancers come in every flavor from tall to short meek to wild and from nonathletic to athletic all the better that every man find at least one of the ladies he likes.  Be sure to keep your eyes on the very athletic one she's a cross between Steffi Graff and Chyna from the WWF.This is a German movie  the dialog is dubbed and not well in some places. It is quite racy even for the early 1960s.  It's obvious that this bomb never was shown in America.Sterno says this movie is number one...I just can't show you the digit that says so.".

	schema:headline " Exploitation horror film needs more of both!";
	schema:reviewBody "European films often went through an editing process to try and make them more commercial for American audiences but this German effort obviously went through more than one metamorphosis to become the clunky film it is now. Story is about a plane load of female dancers headed by the talent agent Gary Webster Alex D'Arcy and his faithful assistant Georgia Helga Franck and while on their way to Singapore they crash into the ocean. Everyone except the pilots survive and after floating in a raft for a few days they find an island to paddle to where they find fresh water and an old shack.SPOILER ALERT Inside the shack the girls and Gary find a dead scientist in a giant web which scares everyone but they figure out that the island is being used to mine uranium. One night Gary heads out for a walk and is bitten by a humongous spider which promptly turns him into a half manhalf spider creature and now he prowls the area. 4 weeks later the troupe of girls are visited by Bobby Rainer Brandt and Joe Harald Maresch who are from the mining company and they tell them that they are going to be saved at last but while waiting for their ship to come Gary the spider monster starts attacking again.This was partially directed by Fritz Bottger aka Jaime Nolan but in interviews actor D'Arcy stated that he took over control of the film and directed all the sequences involving the giant spider and the monster. Originally this was just going to be an exploitive nudie with a bunch of women on an island getting naked but all the nude scenes were edited out and it was changed to a horror film. It's too bad that the nudity didn't make the final cut because this attempt at a horror film needed more than a big puppet spider that looks like it belongs in a sketch with The Count from Sesame Street. There were a few things that I noticed while watching this and right off the bat it's hard not to catch the dreadful excuse at dubbing with actors and actresses moving their mouths to nothing! The cinematography is a complete joke and most of the shots have that low budget grainy look to it and the plane crash itself is just stock footage from another source. Speaking of the plane crash how could they all survive something like that? And while floating in the raft the women continue to wear their high heels! Couldn't they puncture the raft with those inappropriate shoes? Once they land on the island the character Gary starts exuding his male dominance by ordering all the females to do everything he says such as Come girls water That's enough lets look around Come on girls. Gary and the rest of the men on the island take off their shirts and spend the duration of the scenes trying to suck their big guts in and on the first night in the shack one of the girls starts putting the moves on Gary and it takes Georgia to bust them up in which Gary exclaims Damned heat I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I had to laugh at the women who after landing on the island keep tripping and bumping into one another as they attempt to keep their high heels on and when they find some spare clothing in the shack they start to argue and Babs and Nelly get into a cat fight. Actress Barbara Valentin who plays the slutty Babs looks something like Jayne Mansfield and she would actually have a pretty good acting career and work several times with the great German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder. As far as being an exploitationhorror film this doesn't work on either level but it is a curio and those who are interested in early attempts at schlock might find this intriguing enough to warrant a viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's simply no other option than to rate this movie 1 out of 10 but for once in your life DON'T let the rating be an indicator for you to skip this adorably BAD movie! In whichever version available out there in crappy movieland Horrors of Spider Island is a tremendously fun and unforgettable viewing experience! Everything you could possibly seek for in a bad Euroexploitation effort features here from laughable special effects over disastrous acting performances onto goofs  continuity errors that couldn't be more obvious! Originally intended as a pure sex flick the script got altered and retitled so many times that the whole thing eventually turned out to be something that can't be categorized as simply one genre. It's sexploitation horror and mainly unintentional slapstick. We open at some sleazy guy's office as he's recruiting young beauties to take to Singapore for a dance vacationor something. The next scene a totally different plane than the one they left in crashes down in the South Pacific Ocean and  strangely enough  all the girls as well as their manager survive the accident whereas the plane's pilots  crew have mysteriously vanished. Eventually the whole clique strands on a tropical island where they instantly forget about the tragedy the just overcame them and begin to party and sunbath. Sadly for them the island is inhabited by one just one! uraniummutated spider. This lovely critter is as big as a dog and he hasn't got any real spiderlegs but cute claws that he uses in a very sophisticated way. During a nightly walk the spider bites the manager and the venom sort of turns him into a ludicrouslooking crossover between a werewolf and Spiderman. Instead of killing all nine girls immediately the monster just hangs around and the girls don't really search for the missing manager neither. Then suddenly a duo of adventurers arrives at the godforsaken island and the remaining 40 minutes just involve the girls arguing about who may have sex with them first. You'd almost forget that there's a monster wobbling around the island until he briefly shows up again for the totally scarefree climax. This is simple put one messed up and retarded little movie! Entire pieces of film just seem to be missing for no apparent reason and the sound  picture quality is downright pitiful. Most fun can be had with spotting little things that don't make the slightest bit of sense! Like the bitchy girl who parades on the beach with her new bikini even though there's nobody around to admire her beauty! Or the monster that's on the verge of grabbing a new victim by the throat but then suddenly decides not to carry on!! Whenever you're supposed to be frightened to death by the film's unbearable tension all you'll do is laugh and reach for more beers. Anyone who claims that Edward Wood's Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 from outer Space are the worst movies ever made certainly hasn't seen this landmark in bad cinema. Get your claws on it right now!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was reading through several people's comments and it became abundantly clear that because this movie was originally a porno they writ it off as a cheap film with no deeper meaning. Frankly people need to understand that a writer with a message will try to get it out no matter what venue comes their way. If we view this film as a social allegory the inconsistencies and quirks of the movie are suddenly cast in a new light.First we must look at the change in characters once they reach the island. The island represents a separation from society as in Lord of the Flies. The writer shows that civilization puts restraints on both males and females. The male characters when separated from society quickly give into their animalistic and violent tendencies. This is primarily represented by the transformation of the manager into a horrible abomination but can also be witnessed by the fact that the two research assistants begin to fight after only one night on the island. The shift in females however is decidedly different. The females instead of giving into their violent desires gave into their sexual appetite evidenced by well pretty much every scene in the movie. The writer has therefore shown us that the root desires of mankind are summed up as two parts sex and violence chilling commentary indeed.At the end of the film we see the manager sink into the mud as the dancers chase him into the mire. While this might seem silly and over the top it is far from it. The dancers started working together rather than embracing their desires this action was symbolized by the flares their light representing the light shed by wisdom. Thus if we view the spidermanmonster as the darker parts of the human psyche we can see that the light of knowledge pushes them off and takes away the threat they represent. The very end of the film is also potent with rich meaning. On the one hand it shows that while humanity had triumphed in this situation we're still sailing on a stormy sea. Now that these major aspects of symbolism have been discussed let us look at the so called 'inconsistencies'The goofs section listed the view of D'ary from a distance without his makeup on as a screwup but whoever said this is an idiot. Rather it was to show us that when viewing individual cases it might look like men are ravaging beasts however when we view the situation from the distance the image is quite the opposite. We see that rather than being a monster he was simply a man desperately chasing after innocence we see that when he finally reaches the innocence it is inevitable that the end result is it's destruction I highly suspect that the imagery of innocents falling from the cliffs in Catcher and the Rye were inspired directly from this movie.The beginning leg scene might be construed as simply a cheap excuse to show off girls legs but the truth is far deeper. It was showing us that legs are the vehicle we use to travel into the future and which are necessary to enter into as well as escape any situation that life takes us into. When the dancers first leave on the venture we see that they are in a typical transport plane however when they crash it is a kamikaze plane. The reason for this is simple when we leave on ventures they may seem innocent enough but can quickly lead to disaster if we don't watch our path. Indeed they can go so far as to even kill the part of us that makes us human in the movie the author shows this to be our human inhibitions. I hope you have all come to view this film in a new light and hold the appreciation for this movie that it truly deserves. Watching the movie I realized that many of the scenes directly inspired the famous blockbusters of our generation. Jurassic Park II from the scene where they're running through the brush Signs from the scene with the corn in the background Spiderman for the radioactive bite Alien for the latching on of the radioactive spider on his throat Frankenstein when they chase D'Avery with the torches Flight of the Phoenix for the plane crash Freedom Writers for the large female presence ET the Extraterrestial for obvious reasons and any movie involving the female double pimp slap the slapper whapper. I am recommending that they show it in my college film class and I hope all of you can do the same.".

The film forces us to watch several auditions for a dance troop in the beginning. While there are some semicomedic moments and a modicum of character development this is really just an excuse for several of the girls to partially disrobe. This occurs frequently and somewhat randomly throughout the film. Once the troop is formed they leave by plane with their manager Gary Alex Darcy. The plane crashes they all survive aboard a raft and float off to an island with uranium deposits and large nasty spiders who can turn people into werespiders. Then Gilligan and the Skipper come along.... I wish. Regardless of what language it was originally written in the script is utter garbage. Every scene is described by the dialog while you watch it and the language manages to be stiff overdramatic and overacted all at the same time. There are so many scenes with women moaning screaming and slinking about in bras or bikinis in this film that your neighbors might wonder what you are watching if you have the volume up too high and the shades drawn. The cinematography is not entirely awful  there are a few nicely shot landscape scenes  but there are still twice as many unnecessary and overlong pacing disasters. Although its hard to imagine this cast really performing the film strikes me as overdirected. Unless you enjoy selfflagellation I recommend staying away from this abomination.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was horrible all right but for the viewer! This is in a sense a nonmovie rather it is just a bunch of stuff that was filmed and then loosely tied together in order to give the semblance of plot.There are many problems with this film and it has definitely earned its spot on the IMDb bottom 100 list. Let's discuss the major crimes this film commitsSpoilers but hey if you're here it's probably because you like I watched this on MST3K so you already know what happens anyway...1. As most previous commentators have stated there is only one mutant spider on the island. Not much is given to explain its creation except there was some professor on the island who must have been fooling with radiation of genetics or something. Science in the 50's was like magic in movies there was no explanation for why it could mutate animals it just did.2. After the guy Gary is bitten by the creature he transforms into a spiderlike monster not really more like a guy with clawed hands and a messed up face but bear with me here. After he scares the girls on the island he mysteriously vanishes for most the movie! I'm serious the next 40 or so minutes is the girls doing things on the island while dressed erotically. And no not even that redeems the film.3. Two sailors show up on the island which immediately prompts squabbles among the women over who belongs to who. Very misogynist since everyone seems to like the guys who treats woman like objects. There are dances group bathing and other various hijinks all of which take place during the above mentioned 40 minutes of monsterless horror. Not for one moment during this time is there mention of the monster or even a feeling of fear among them. There is only pure unadulterated hedonistic feelings of joy save a good cat fight and fisticuffs between the two men.4. This is a personal problem with the movie but a major one for me nonetheless. When the monster finally reappears he looks exactly like he did when we last saw him. What the hell?! I figured with all the time he spent off camera he was probably mutating further. He was bitten by a mutant spider for God's sake! He should have grown a couple extra sets of arms or something! But no he just comes back on screen same stupid make up and kills two more people.5. After discovering their two dead companions the girls finally rally up the strength to hunt Gary down and destroy him. Maybe if they had done this to begin with the last two people wouldn't have been killed. But then I didn't like anyone in the movie anyway so good riddance. Anyway the chase Gary out to a field full of quicksand which wasn't even shown or even mentioned previously in the movie he sinks he drowns he dies. I really hate 'deus ex machina' endings. They rarely work especially in bad bmovies. But it hastened the end of this movie so whatever.So there you have it. The folks on the Satellite of Love made this watch much much easier. Mike and the bots help was down this crap but it still is tough to take.1 star for the movie which it's lucky to get that and 8 for the MST3K version. Not the best episode but still highly entertaining.".

Before long a radioactive spider bites their manager and turns him into a wild eyed furryfaced monster with three fangs and a passion for strangling. But remember there's no need to fear the worst.This was made in Germany as a skin flick. For its U.S. release it was reedited in an effort to appeal to both fans of nudie and horror movies. It appealed to neither. The biggest horror of this film is the MAD MENstyled sexism that our token male Gary exhibits toward the womenor as he calls them girls. Then there's the horrendous dubbing job right down to the halfassed background noises. In one scene as a dancer showers beneath a waterfall we hear what sounds like gargling. When the plane crashes it magically transforms from a DC3 into what looks like a Japanese Zero in a ball of kamikaze fire. Furthermore Gary calls his gun a revolver even though it has no chamber. In fact when Gary loads the gun he shoves in a magazine thereby proving it's not a revolver.Not that any of this matters. The socalled plot was merely an excuse to show pretty young women in various states of undress. In that regard I suppose the film succeeded. And the jazzy score greatly contributes to the burlesque mood the film sets from Scene One. Of course it was 1960 so the most cheesecake you'll see involves tightfitting bikinis. Still they do fit tightly!Now I'll have to rewatch the MST3K episode.".

However the plan crashes in the South Pacific killing the pilot and crew. Gary and the showgirls manage to make it to a small island in a rubber raft. There they find a deserted hut with the body of a man suspended in a giant spider web  he was apparently a scientist looking for uranium on the island. Soon after Gary goes out for a walk and is bitten by a spider around the size of a small dog. He kills it but its bite results in his turning into a monster. He begins to prey on the showgirls.First of all the synopsis on IMDb is inaccurate since there is only one spider and the one person bitten does not turn into a spider but a sort of weird werespider hybrid. However that hardly makes a difference because this is a terrible movie and maybe the most sexist film I have ever seen. It's really much more of a sexploitation film than a horror film the horror content is pretty light. The showgirls who end up on the island are portrayed as completely brainless and helpless without men around. When two men arrive in a rowboat with supplies for the dead scientist the women are only too happy to have sex with complete strangers because they are SO hungry for men.The film is also really shoddy technically. The special effects are laughable. The big but not giant spider that originally bites Gary looks like a cartoon menace and the werespider that Gary becomes looks a bit scary but sure doesn't look anything like a spider. In his excellent book on 50's and early 60's SF films Keep Watching the Skies Bill Warren reviews this under the title Horrors of Spider Island. He gives it a negative review but his review still didn't prepare me for how shockingly amateurish this film was. Proof that continental Europeans can make lowbudget films just as badly as the Americans!".

The following week I tracked it down to a small London cinema where they screened single films continuously several times a day without supporting features.  I hadn't intended seeing it more than once on this occasion but I can recall being so mesmerised that I watched the programme through three times.  Clearly I was out of step with the climate of critical opinion.  The reviewers had slated it and the audience around me was distinctly hostile.  There was a lot of fidgeting and derisory  shouts.  Quite a few walked out.  Behaviour was often bad in British cinemas in the 'fifties particularly if viewers got bored.  The manager called the police in during a screening I attended a few years later of The Trouble WIth Harry and I can even remember screaming at the usherettes to stop talking when I first saw A Face in the Crowd.  I had to wait many years before I heard good things being said about Gone to Earth.  It was in 1988 when someone introduced a  showing of it on British television most enthusiastically.  Whatever one thinks about the relative merits of Powell and Pressburger's films  I am clearly in a minority in thinking this their finest there is no doubt that they are now appreciated in a way they never were when they first appeared.  But if passion for what is still considered one of their minor works may seem rather over the top let me say but one thing  where else in the whole of cinema is there a more haunting and magical evocation of English landscape!  Christopher Challis a brilliant cinematographer is  the real star of the film.  Undoubtedly and this is perhaps at the core of its original problems style matters more than content.  The plot is little more than Victorian melodrama  lecherous squire deflowers simple country girl who has married local vicar  and the dialogue is curiously stilted.  However this hardly matters in a work cinematically choreographed with such brilliance.  The final foxhunting sequence where the film's many strands are brought together is visually and aurally one of the most spellbinding in all cinema.  The huntsman's cry of Gone to earth! at the very end has haunted me for well over half a lifetime.".

Based on the Mary Webb novel the movie was filmed in Shropshire  the book  as most of Webb's were was also set there. The windswept Stiperstones and The Devil's Chair are not make believe. They really do exist and you can easily visit these locations.I always wanted to visit Shropshire as a child I loved the Lone Pine stories by Malcolm Saville that were set there  I still do . They as Webb's stories all were set in real places. The little church  Godshill  in the film is still standing and you can still make out the shape of the baptism pool in the garden. It's a beautiful atmospheric place.I have now visited these locations several times. The long chimney you see standing in several sequences can still be found in the ruins of the old Snailbeach mines. It is so wonderful to stand in these places on these hills  the stiperstones the Long Mynd  and imagine 57 years ago when all the actors and crew stood in the very same place you can't explain how you feel but it's something very extraordinary.The film itself is a strangely evocative piece that features eerily scored music wild but effective performances. Cyril Cusack stands out in a restrained dignified part as the sad parson.It is his character that I felt so sorry for.Although poor Jennifer Jones  Hazel  is a tormented soul that you can't help but feel attracted to.A glorious piece of cinema of the past with wonderful locations. The plot may be all too familiar but the scenery the characters and yes Foxy all help pass the time in a blink of an eye.

I did not know at the time that it had been shot in Shropshire and was not aware that there was such a place as Shropshire. I was living at the time in the smoky outskirts of Manchester which had been despoiled by the worst excesses of the Industrial Revolution which coincidentally had first seen the light of day in Shropshire of all places. For some reason the Industry moved out of Shropshire leaving behind a few traces such as the mine shafts one of which figures so tragically in this film and others such as the first ever iron bridge which of course can be found at Ironbridge near where the film was made. Some years later I happened to go on an outing to Shropshire and was told by the people living near Church Stretton that the film had been made at Much Wenlock which was quite near there. I never got to go to Much Wenlock but I regularly visit there in spirit when I watch the film on my video. at this stage I must have seen it about 40 times  I watch old films whilst breakfasting at my home in Ireland to which I finally returned after 29 long years in Lancashire. I have read some of the other comments and I would agree that plot wise it is little more than a run of the mill Victorian bodice ripper. But I must heartily agree with one of the people who commented that this film evokes the quintessential essence of English landscape at its best. If it was a painting it would be by John Constable who captured the special something that Gone To Earth epitomises.".

	schema:headline " A Magnificent Classic of British Cinema Lost for 51 Years";
	schema:reviewBody "This amazing film was made in 1950 but was never released and has apparently never been shown in a commercial cinema. A mangled form of it minus 35 minutes reedited and with some extra linking scenes was released in 1952 as 'The Wild Heart'. This was because Jennifer Jones the star was the wife of the control freak David Selznick who could not bear the fact that this masterpiece had been made without his supervision and represented something authentic of which he himself was incapable. For the film which Powell and Pressburger really made it was necessary to wait until 2001 when it was released in a restored version with the most beautiful Technicolor cinematography on DVD as part of the Powell and Pressburger retrospective revival. Of this film for more than half a century therefore one could truly say it had 'gone to earth' as the huntsman's cry has it in the final devastating scene. The film is based on a novel by Mary Webb who died in 1927 aged only 46. Another novel of hers 'Precious Bane' has been filmed more than once and helped make the reputation of the British actress Janet McTeer. Jennifer Jones is totally stunning in this film as Hazel a semiwild halfGypsy girl with a pet fox named Foxy a pet raven rabbits and a small menagerie of other creatures. She lives with her Celtic harpplaying father in an isolated cottage. He is wonderfully played by Esmond Knight with true country humour. The wild gypsy girl who roams the hills was a motif well known to Mary Webb from Theodore WattsDunton's fictional Welsh gypsy characters Sinfi Lovell and Rhona Boswell who were based on real people. This film is shot on the Welsh borders as they were in 1949 and in Shropshire. The landscape is wild and wonderful magnificently filmed and the movie is like a paean to the wilds. The story is like a Thomas Hardy tale though less sophisticated and with more than a touch of Victorian melodrama. Cyril Cusack does a superbly restrained job of playing a quiet vicar who cannot express himself and is paralyzed by inactivity like the main character in John Cowper Powys's novel 'Wolf Solent'. He marries Hazel but 'respects' her too much to touch her and so does not consummate the marriage. That kind of thing often happened in those days. Along comes the monstrously egotistical and unrestrained squire played to full effect by David Farrar who becomes obsessed by Hazel with dire consequences all round. One of the finest performances is by Hugh Griffith as Farrar's valet. It was one of the greatest moments of that fine character actor's career. Jennifer Jones is entirely magical and captivating with her weird looks and her expression of always seeing the fairies. She does a superb job as does Edmond Knight of speaking a genuine rough country dialect. Since British viewers have to put up with Brooklyn and other mangled and horrible accents it seems only right that Americans should have to try to decipher Welsh Border dialect for once but of course they are too spoilt to try and this has been a cause of complaint. However the film has full authenticity and is a miraculous preservation in aspic of a lost world. The sets are very good indeed and all the locations are genuine. This is no fantasy it is real in what it portrays only the story is a bit over the top melodramatically. Otherwise this was then and now is now. This film can be watched repeatedly by those who want to comprehend a world that is gone forever like that of the film 'Owd Bob' see my review of it. It would not be fair to refrain from pointing out that Foxy the fox deserved an animal Oscar as he is in nearly every scene.".

He marries Hazel but 'respects' her too much to touch her and so does not consummate the marriage. That kind of thing often happened in those days. Along comes the monstrously egotistical and unrestrained squire played to full effect by David Farrar who becomes obsessed by Hazel with dire consequences all round. One of the finest performances is by Hugh Griffith as Farrar's valet. It was one of the greatest moments of that fine character actor's career. Jennifer Jones is entirely magical and captivating with her weird looks and her expression of always seeing the fairies. She does a superb job as does Edmond Knight of speaking a genuine rough country dialect. Since British viewers have to put up with Brooklyn and other mangled and horrible accents it seems only right that Americans should have to try to decipher Welsh Border dialect for once but of course they are too spoilt to try and this has been a cause of complaint. However the film has full authenticity and is a miraculous preservation in aspic of a lost world. The sets are very good indeed and all the locations are genuine. This is no fantasy it is real in what it portrays only the story is a bit over the top melodramatically. Otherwise this was then and now is now. This film can be watched repeatedly by those who want to comprehend a world that is gone forever like that of the film 'Owd Bob' see my review of it. It would not be fair to refrain from pointing out that Foxy the fox deserved an animal Oscar as he is in nearly every scene.";

	schema:headline " Wondrously atmospheric drama";
	schema:reviewBody "The films of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger are celebrated not necessarily for their story lines but for their exquisite attentionto detail. 'Gone to Earth 1950' was shot onlocation at Much Wenlock in Shropshire England with some interior filming at Shepparton Studios and you'll rarely find a more glorious example of a natural setting used to evoke atmosphere. Even from the opening sequence there's something magical about the English countryside  the wind seems to whisper with the music of a harp the trees shudder in the breeze as though awaking from a stupor the clouds stir overhead signalling discontent in the heavens. Christopher Challis' stunning Technicolor photography captures every natural detail and imbues it with a mystical charm that is stifling and almost oppressive. The Archers produced the film in association with Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick the latter of whom was so disappointed with the end result that he commissioned Rouben Mamoulian to extensively reshoot scenes for the film's North American release which was retitled 'The Wild Heart 1952.'Even though Powell and Pressburger effectively ignored Selznick's insistent recommendations for improvement the producer's influence is still readily seen. For one the film starred Jennifer Jones by then Selznick's wife who looks luminous while retaining that earthy homeliness of an English country girl. Her character Hazel Woodus in many ways recalls Pearl Chavez from 'Duel in the Sun 1946' Selznick's costly Western epic. Both women at first naive and uncorrupted must choose between marriage to a reliable if unexciting suitor Joseph Cotten in one film Cyril Cusack in this one and the embrace of an unpleasant morallybarren scumbag Gregory Peck or David Farrar. In Selznick's Western Pearl's halfInjun ethnicity is shamelessly exploited to offer her character some sort of uncontrollable base sexuality. In 'Gone to Earth' that Hazel's mother was a gypsy is utilised for similar purposes her physical attraction to the repulsive Jack Reddin apparently stemming from this shady halfheritage in direct opposition to the noble Christianity of her parson husband.Being mostly about atmosphere 'Gone to Earth' doesn't have the exquisitely wellrounded characters of 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp 1943' or 'I Know Where I'm Going! 1945.' Nevertheless the main cast is to be commended for their understated roles. Jennifer Jones' British accent wavers on occasion but her character is gorgeous and sympathetic one whose transgressions we're willing to forgive on account of her general innocence there's certainly a childlike naivet in her unashamed affinity with nature particularly her affection towards a pet fox. Less affable is David Farrar whose oppressive fox hunting squire is a perpetual affront to Hazel's virginity. His character at times reminded me of Vincent Price's role in 'Dragonwyck 1946' in which Gene Tierney's virtuousness is similarly destroyed by a uncouth and opportunistic nobleman. Cyril Cusack's clergyman however honourable embodies the adage that nice guys finish last. The film quietly rebukes Edward Marston's unwillingness to take charge of his marriage to Hazel and yet he overcomes his timidity only to lose everything he's ever cared about.".

Like Powell's earlier BLACK NARCISSUS this film works on a symbolic and psychological level but both story and dialogue have painful weaknesses made worse by censorship and the dreadful U.S.commercial cut. Avoid older versions of GONE TO EARTH they usually contain censorship cuts which change the rhythm of several scenes and mutilate the climax.

The colouring is sumptuous with many closeup head shots surrounded by the rich colours of sky and countryside.The story of a naive country girl courted by two suiters a country priest and a local squire is very reminiscent of postwar westerns and Powell shows the relationships between the three as a battle between the order and probity of the priest's lifestyle and beliefs and the squire's passion and unrestrained desires a Hardyesque reflection of British society in the 19th century a view found in the Archer's other films such as A Canterbuty Tale and I Know Where I'm Going. It is a look back to what might be considered a more genteel Englishness but does it with far more style than the contemporary Ealing Studio films.Beautiful to look at forwardlooking cinematography and some cracking music by Brian Easdale who had already worked on The Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes this is classic Powell and Pressburger.

It starts off with the feel of something whimsical but turns into something way darker with poor Hazel caught in a trap no matter which way she turns. The fox in the story is obviously a symbol for her own wild nature innocent and yet hunted and never knowing why. I would recommend this to anyone who writes feature scripts as a strong example of how to keep the audience sympathy juddering around seeing good in everyone and bad in everyone too. Only Hazel comes off as the character who is doing nothing more than follow her nature. A very deep script.".

	schema:headline " Period love triangle  with luscious Jennifer Jones caught in the middle.";
	schema:reviewBody "Jennifer Jones is great as a carefree mountain Gypsy girl ripe for matrimony with any man who can tear her away from her love of wild animals and especially her 'Foxy'. In its most basic form this film much reminds us of the priorDuel in the Sun in which Jennifer plays a half breed. In both cases she is a marginal member of conventional European society. Also in both films she has a choice between a conventional gentlemanly suitor and an impatient bully who nonetheless turns her on physically and pursues her relentlessly. In the present film the gentlemanly suitor is Pastor Edward MarstonCyril Cusack and the bully is squire Jack RiddinDavid Farrer. She is not overly enthusiastic about marrying either as her mother warned that for the woman marriage promises endless toll and suffering. Actually Jack should have been favored as her husband by the promise to her father that she would marry the first man to pass by their cottage. This was in fact Jack who came looking for her but didn't know exactly where she lived. She hid when he knocked on the door so he passed on. Later the pastor also smitten by her beauty and personality he experienced at a church social comes calling and after they get to know each other a bit proposes marriage he being judged the first to stop by their cottage even though Jack actually was first. But she had had some unpleasant experiences with Jack hence he was discounted. Soon she would come to regret this decision as Jack refused to give up the chase even after she was married. She came to seek his unrelenting passion over the unexciting Pastor Marston and stayed a while in Jack's mansion. The parson showed up at Jack's mansion and quarreled with the two. It was decided that she would go home with Marston. But now Marston's mother who had lived with him for many years voiced her determination to leave his house if Hazel were to stay. Also some churchmen came calling to advise Marston that he should give up Hazel as her affair with Jack was now commonly known. Marston replied that he was giving up the clergy. Jack would express his frustration in being rejected by organizing a fox and hound event in which he hoped that Hazel's Foxy would be caught. But Hazel ran out of the house looking for Foxy whom she found and carried toward safety. But she didn't quite make it. In her haste falling down a deep well or mine shift that should have been covered. Jack had unwittingly destroyed not only Hazel's Foxy but she herself. Edmond Knight was memorable as Hazel's father who made some money playing his harp and repairing such as well as making coffins and other wooden objects. Several times Jennifer sang a mellow song with or without his accompaniment.....The meaning of the title is that the fox or whatever prey has gone into its burrow where the hounds are too big to get in. It could also be applied to Hazel's unfortunate demise. We could perhaps project the theme to encompass all of the natural world as the victim of human overpopulation overexploitation of natural resources and moving into cities away from their traditional ties with the natural world which marginal peoples such as Gypsies still sometimes cared for.See it at YouTube".

It's this fantasy women used to have when they felt ashamed of their sexuality if I protest and he FORCES me I can't be to blame. Or alternatively they really do want to say no but don't have the power to. Either way I can't help but view this with modern eyes and I find it offensive.At the end of the film Hazel dies while being literally hunted with hounds by the squire she eventually rejected because it seems she is a loose woman and can't be allowed to live. Again this is just shocking.As for the actors Jennifer Jones is rather an odd actress with a dreadfully mangled accent. Especially at the beginning of the film her English country girl sounds like she's from the Deep South of America. She was David O. Selznick's discovery and his wife which is why she got the part but she was really the wrong choice for this role. David Farrar plays the rogue of the piece with a Nivenish villainous flair and Cyril Cusack is sweetly sad as the mild parson a noble creature who gets a raw deal throughout the film. The other actors aren't bad and the Technicolor scenery and the music is magnificent to PP's credit. I only wish they hadn't chosen this story.".

The Parson's love was sincere but lacked passion and the Squire's had plenty of passion but nothing else.

Stephen Hopkins plays every scene for as much tension as he can I defy you to watch the kitchen scene without cringing at every slomo and displays a De Palma like understanding of virtuoso camerawork.

Sure the characters aren't completely fleshed out but there is enough depth for you to feel for them.  The action is good and despite many contrary opinions I think the pacing is good too.One of the high points of this film was the sequence where the wife and daughter are in the house and the audience is left suspecting there may be a bomb plant.  The camera shots that frame the stove turning on the light bulb the phone jack etc.  were done very well and suspensefully though I suspect this well done sequence is what is making many people call this film slow.Finally the use of The Joshua Tree by U2 was a really nice touch.Overall this film is not outstanding but if you want a movie that is relatively light but has some comedy drama suspense and action all mixed in then check it out.".

Jones plays an Irish terrorist in this revenge movie wreaking his havoc in Boston. The film's best asset is the suspense it builds for the two hours and the fact it keeps you interested the entire way right from the opening scene.The negatives are too much profanity and a contrived story in spots particularly at the end when the fight between Bridges and Jones goes on forever as does the scene with Jones trying to save his wife.

I found Jeff Bridges desire to resume a normal life in Boston after his questionable IRAlike activities back home in Ireland appealing and his lovely fiancee played by Suzy Amis very likeable. Tommy Lee Jones has a great Irish accent and the lunatic he plays is great fun to watch. Lloyd Bridges as Jeff's uncle and Boston cop Forest Whittaker are equally appealing.

I should have been forewarned when I didn't recall ever having heard of it before. The opening segment in the prison where the inmates speak Gaelic  I believe and is subtitled allowed for a bit of confusion when Jones dispatches his cell mate and says something over his body. Even with repeated viewings none of us could make out what exactly he says or even if it's in English. Was the murder done for a reason besides needing a bomb bunker or was there a back story? Then to watch him assemble his bomb using all kinds of devices including machinethreaded pipes explosives and other unusual items hat would seem to be a bit difficult to accrue in a max security prison he blows a hole in the wall and apparently makes his way from that desolate area without any problems although they don't bother to show how. He next appears in Boston living in a decrepit rusty old boat on an abandoned pier which miraculously not only has electricity but also has cable TV  as the orchestra promo mentions that it's on AE not an over the air channel. He also has unlimited funds to obtain everything he needs from explosives to electronics to transportation to get around the Boston area. Bridges character as we soon find out is also a fugitive IRA guy wanted by Interpol yet he apparently had no problem getting past the Boston PD's background check to get hired under his phony identity. He also exhibits almost every Hollywood clich about the maverick cop riding a mc to a bomb scene while smoking a butt and wearing a Hawaiian shirt to let us know how cool he is. He also ignores basic safety procedures while disarming bombs even though he is supposedly the one who instructs everyone on EOD protocol. Jones also exhibits the troubling Hollywood syndrome of being able to single handedly surveill multiple people and locate their homes even their vacation homes and also gain employment with Boston PD as a janitor  once again bypassing the pesky background checks a large agency like BPD conducts even for civilians with not a care in the world. They also never bothered to explain how Jones was able to get Lloyd Bridges from the bar bathroom out the door and to the school yard  where he was able to secure him with an unbelievably complex device without a single person noticing. Then of course there is the TV screen continuously showing Bridges wife in closeup even though she is just one person in the Boston Pops. The story just kept getting more and more ludicrous and of course there had to be the obligatory Hollywood fight where the bad guy is almost indestructible no matter what he is hit with. If you come across this keep on going it was 2 hours that I'll never get back. I can only imagine that the Dude and the rest were in a slump and needed a quick payday without regards to the script. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for the Boston scenery.".

He also exhibits almost every Hollywood clich about the maverick cop riding a mc to a bomb scene while smoking a butt and wearing a Hawaiian shirt to let us know how cool he is. He also ignores basic safety procedures while disarming bombs even though he is supposedly the one who instructs everyone on EOD protocol. Jones also exhibits the troubling Hollywood syndrome of being able to single handedly surveill multiple people and locate their homes even their vacation homes and also gain employment with Boston PD as a janitor  once again bypassing the pesky background checks a large agency like BPD conducts even for civilians with not a care in the world. They also never bothered to explain how Jones was able to get Lloyd Bridges from the bar bathroom out the door and to the school yard  where he was able to secure him with an unbelievably complex device without a single person noticing. Then of course there is the TV screen continuously showing Bridges wife in closeup even though she is just one person in the Boston Pops. The story just kept getting more and more ludicrous and of course there had to be the obligatory Hollywood fight where the bad guy is almost indestructible no matter what he is hit with. If you come across this keep on going it was 2 hours that I'll never get back. I can only imagine that the Dude and the rest were in a slump and needed a quick payday without regards to the script. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for the Boston scenery.";

Turns out the two main bombsters were friends in Ireland growing up both wanted to 'keep the English out of Ireland' but Jones went too far and ended up with a life sentence in prison for killing a bunch of people. The movie starts with his escape by blowing out a hole in the prison wall believable? not very... then he ends up in Boston finds his old friendnemesis as a hero with a changed name. Revenge motivates Jones to kill by bombing everyone close to his old friend plus Bridges himself. He does kill several police plus the dad played by real dad Lloyd Bridges but Bridges manages to deactivate a few of them. The strangest his partner had earphones on with a small bomb tied to another in a speaker and if you cut one wire they would both go off so they cut them AT THE VERY SAME INSTANT which is highly unlikely given the speed of an electrical signal. The big showdown came in the abandoned ship the bad guy had holed up in an explosion gets him as the two good guys run on the dock and I wondered why they didn't dive into the water.

	schema:reviewBody "Jimmy Dove is a Boston bomb disposal expert who quits to train rookies instead.  However a series of bombs that seem familiar to him bring back old memories.  He suspects that exIRA bomber Ryan Gaerity is behind it as part of a revenge attack and must stop him before he can kill again.How many bomber out for revenge' movies do we need.  The reason Hollywood loves them is because we get an easy excuse for big explosions.  However Blown Away fails on so many levels.  First it tries to flesh out the characters but this doesn't work and only serves to slow things down. Secondly the action is silly and has no real suspense  it's entertaining enough if you just want to see things blow up but if you want thrills or tension as well then you're in the wrong place.  It's not all bad  but the whole film just feels like it's halfbaked liked someone was stuck with a bad idea but did the best they could with it.A personal bugbear of mine is this whole Hollywood obsession with the IRA  why do characters always have to be too crazy for the IRA' or have gone good form the IRA etc.  How on earth exIRA member Dove gets into the Boston police force is the first joke but also the fact that Gaerity is too crazy etc' is daft.  Do the IRA put people out for bombing innocent people  I think not..hence the word terrorist'.Jeff Bridges is OK but really just runs round with a furrowed brow all the time.  Jones is OTT it's like he realises that this is crap and wants people to see his tongue is in his cheek.  His Oirish accent is terrible and just made me laugh.  The worse is Lloyd Bridges  is he awake for most of this?  The two funniest bits with him in it is where he is attached to some absurd bomb thing but even funnier is him in an Irish pub drinking some black watery liquid that's supposed to be Guinness!  If I made the drink I would have sued!  Quality people like Amis and Whitaker are just plain wasted.OK  some of the action is good and it's not all terrible but it's not very good.  Whether it be the bad performances bad plotting or just sheer silliness of the whole thing it lacks tension and it's too lame to get involved in.".

	onyx:emotionText "Jimmy Dove is a Boston bomb disposal expert who quits to train rookies instead.  However a series of bombs that seem familiar to him bring back old memories.  He suspects that exIRA bomber Ryan Gaerity is behind it as part of a revenge attack and must stop him before he can kill again.How many bomber out for revenge' movies do we need.  The reason Hollywood loves them is because we get an easy excuse for big explosions.  However Blown Away fails on so many levels.  First it tries to flesh out the characters but this doesn't work and only serves to slow things down. Secondly the action is silly and has no real suspense  it's entertaining enough if you just want to see things blow up but if you want thrills or tension as well then you're in the wrong place.

The end result although not all together great.In the end makes for passable enough viewing.Bridges as the heroic Jimmy Dove steps effortlessly in to his charismatic lead roll. That said it doesn't exactly challenge him as an actor like it should. To be quite frank this is the sort of roll he can do in his sleep. A million miles from his more difficult stab at portraying an extra terrestrial in the 1984 scifiromance vehicle 'Starman'. As for Jones his personal performance as former IRA man Ryan Gaerity can be described as mediocre at best. He does show enthusiasm in his roll. But the result is a fair bit of mugging as he rant and raves at Bridges through out the movies running time of just under two hours. The less said about his woeful attempt at an oirish accent the better. Needless to say it rates as one of the worst ever. Only beaten by Robert Duvall's embarrassingly bad scottish accent in 'A Shot at Glory'. Thank god for Forest Whitaker as one of Jimmy Doves pupils. It's almost always good to see Whitaker in a film and his effortless cynism and charisma certainly livens up the enterprise.As for the film it self. It's a sadly predictable affair. With a script although not entirely bad is hardly inspiring. There's also the usual plot holes to be found in this kind of popcorn fodder. While the inclusion of Jeff Bridges old man Lloyd  in a small supporting roll seems gratuitous and not necessarily needed. That said director Hopkins makes the best of the material he has been given. His direction is slick enough and manages to keep the pace going. Where he shines most of all as a director is not in the amazing explosive sequences where the bombs finally detonate. But in the way he makes his camera go to the places we don't normally see. In this case the inner workings of the deadly bombs which is of course a master stroke of ingenuity. I can assume that this owes much and was inspired by the ground breaking work of the Cohen brothers. It was they after all who invented and used such imagery in many of their earlier work.All in all 'Blown Away' is not the best in a series of 'mad bomber' movies. That award probably goes to Jan De Bonts 'Speed' that was released the same year. Never the less it's still a passable enough way to pass the time. Even with it's faults. Just sit back and try and not to engage your brain and you might just enjoy it. But someone really should have shot Tommy Lee Jones for that laughable accent.

Soon it gets personal for Jimmy as he discovers that his old terrorist mate from Ireland Ryan is behind a series of bombings  he is out for revenge against Jimmy his family  friends as it was Jimmy who put Ryan behind bars in Ireland all those years ago...Directed by Stephen Hopkins this is actually the second Hopkins directed film I have seen in the past twenty four hours after also seeing The Reaping 2007 yesterday it wasn't planned  it was a coincidence  pretty lousy luck as The Reaping was average  this was plain crap. At two hours long Blown Away is very slow going  apart from the last fifteen or so minutes is really dull lifeless bland  dare I say it even boring. The melodramatics between Jimmy  his family are unintentionally funny the scene when his wife jumps in the jacuzzi to shout at Jimmy is pure comedy while the hero with a dark past role just doesn't suit Bridges his confrontations with Tommy Lee Jones are awful as it seems to be a contest between the both of them to discover who can do the worst Irish accent. The plot is extremely predictable routine  by the numbers as the clichd tough guy hero with a dark past has to save the day on his own playing by his own rules any number of better action films use this scenario  add that to a script that offers no surprises good guy wins in the end bad guy is stopped  feels like little or no effort has gone into it.For a big budget action thriller Blown Away is really short on action or thrills there's a decent explosion at the end a truck is blown up  there's a speeding jeep  that's it. For a two hour film not enough happens. Footage from Blown Away was edited into two low budget action films called Stealth Fighter 1999  Agent Red 2000. The Boston locations don't add anything to the film at all to be honest. Apparently the shockwave from the ship explosion at the end shattered 8000 windows in East Boston. If you really want to see an exciting action thriller about bombs then watch Speed 1994 again instead  see how a proper action film should be done.This has decent production values  is well made for what it is but it's still a rubbish film. The acting is poor from a good cast father  son Jeff  Lloyd Bridges appear here together.Blown Away is a poor action thriller with virtually no action  some poor performances from a decent cast this is just bad all round really  far too predictable.".

If you really want to see an exciting action thriller about bombs then watch Speed 1994 again instead  see how a proper action film should be done.This has decent production values  is well made for what it is but it's still a rubbish film. The acting is poor from a good cast father  son Jeff  Lloyd Bridges appear here together.Blown Away is a poor action thriller with virtually no action  some poor performances from a decent cast this is just bad all round really  far too predictable.";

Although some of the dialogue and characterizations not to mention the music inspire giggles there's a fair amount to be admired here. I was pleasantly surprised by how frank the film is in its portrayal of institutionalized racism and its effects on the rankandfile soldiers and the buracracy that controls their lives. Red Buttons and the woman who played his wife both won Oscars for their roles and deservedly so. They are not the main characters of the film but they embody the film's message and its spirit as well and are the most naturally written characters in the movie. Red Buttons's display of rage when his wife attempts to disguise her ethnicity is amazingly genuine and moving. Yes the women are portrayed in a derogatory fashion as a previous reviewer has observed. But this was 1957 after all and on top of that the film takes place in a military setting. Add to that the fact that Japan at that time was at least as bad as the West in its treatment of women and it's hardly a surprise that the gender dynamic is what it is. The most ironic thing I found was the fact that although Hollywood was comfortable casting Asian women in the film the one speaking role by a Japanese male character who has a subtly romantic role in relation to an American woman was given to Ricardo Monalban. It was okay to have miscegenation portrayed with some frankness as long as it involved Japanese women not Japanese men. Sad".

One should try to observe criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time. Clearly by the Sex in the City standards Charlie Chaplin was horribly boring. However when judged from the prospective of 1925 America he was fantastic. Likewise Sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixedrace love affair American manifest destiny arrogance and prejudice and the complexity of different cultures. It is a natural next step to such films as Gentleman's Agreement. Its purpose however was not just social commentary rather it is entertaining and enjoyable with innumerable lines that one just doesn't forget.However even when taken only as a love story it is terrific. Although some attack Brando's accent he is at his near best in nuance and characterization. Buttons and Umeki who both won Oscars and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film.Taka the real star does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for Brando while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty. Her speech when she first meets and speaks with Brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema. The dialog between Taka and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the film's end is equally good. Of course it doesn't have the mouthsucking spitswapping and worse that exemplifies love in today's movies but that makes it all the better. It portrays true love and passion and not just heat. If this movie doesn't touch you then you are just too young too cynical or dead.".

As this film so amply shows these relationships were not only frowned upon by both Americans and Japanese but they were expressly forbidden by the U.S. military. This is especially interesting to mean American living in Korea where such interracial relationships are common. There are many delightful visuals in this film. The beauty and grace of Japanese culture is well depicted even if it is somewhat stereotypical. You must remember that this was the 1950s and political correctness was not yet the norm. Also Marlon Brando and James Garner are always assets to any film. Ricardo Montalban posing as a Japanese man is completely laughable and adds to quirky value of this film.

	schema:reviewBody "That's pretty much what I thought of this film.  I half expected Brando to start yelling SUKIYAKI!!! at the top of his lungs as he walks down an alleyway in Japan.  I was amazed to learn that Brando was nominated for an Oscar for this film because for the life of me I can't see what a woman would see in his character especially a Japanese woman.  Yes I'm female. Brando kind of mumbles through the whole thing and his character doesn't have any kind of intelligence or kindness.I'm sure this movie was a big deal in 1957.  It actually does a reasonably good job of bringing up issues with interracial marriages which is still a hot topic in large portions of the world.  However a movie that I think addresses the topic in a more interesting and timeless fashion is The Bitter Tea of General Yen starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra.  General Yen impressed me a great deal whereas Sayonara did not.The happy surprise in this film was Red Buttons' performance.  My only previous exposure to Red Buttons was in things like Dean Martin roasts when I was a kid.  I didn't understand why he was famous.  Buttons earnedwon an Oscar for his sympathetic portrayal of a  openminded man who marries a Japanese woman and willingly learns Japanese culture because of his love. I'm not convinced the Brando character would ever do that.".

I was amazed to learn that Brando was nominated for an Oscar for this film because for the life of me I can't see what a woman would see in his character especially a Japanese woman.  Yes I'm female. Brando kind of mumbles through the whole thing and his character doesn't have any kind of intelligence or kindness.I'm sure this movie was a big deal in 1957.  It actually does a reasonably good job of bringing up issues with interracial marriages which is still a hot topic in large portions of the world.  However a movie that I think addresses the topic in a more interesting and timeless fashion is The Bitter Tea of General Yen starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra.  General Yen impressed me a great deal whereas Sayonara did not.The happy surprise in this film was Red Buttons' performance.  My only previous exposure to Red Buttons was in things like Dean Martin roasts when I was a kid.  I didn't understand why he was famous.  Buttons earnedwon an Oscar for his sympathetic portrayal of a  openminded man who marries a Japanese woman and willingly learns Japanese culture because of his love. I'm not convinced the Brando character would ever do that.";

	schema:reviewBody "Set historically during US engagement in the Korean War 195053 and postWWII occupation of Japan 194552 Sayonara adapted from James Michener's book relates the romantic relationships of two military men stationed in Korea Major Lloyd Ace Gruver Marlon Brando and squadron mechanic Airman Joe Kelly Red Buttons with two Japanese women respectively Hanaogi Miiko Taka star of the Matsubayashi theater review and Katsumisan Miyoshi Umeki. Ace a fighter pilot of F86 Saber jets has shot down several Russian made Chinese piloted MIG15s over Korean airspace. The film begins with Gruver taking leave in Kobe Kansai area as requested by a superior officer who has arranged a hopefully prenuptial meeting between Ace and his daughter.The meaningful brunt of the storyline is carried by the romance between Kelly and Katsumi and issues of interracial marriage miscegenation in the military. The term miscegenation gained common usage during slavery 1860s but early colonial states also forbid interracial marriages. These civil laws and military policies were repealed by Congress in 1967. There were estimates of 300000 interracial international marriages involving US military personnel in Europe and Asia between 1944 and 1952 giving rise to the often disparaging term war bride. Even before the Roman Empire romantic relationships between the military and local women had been and still remain among the more tenuous areas of military occupation.Some have been critical of Sayonara for insensitive stereotyping of Japanese culture customs and behavior but the film's most blatant stereotype is the good IL' boy portrayed by Brando. Objections have questioned the seemingly obsequious roles of Japanese women  and in particular Katsumi with her polite self effacing manner. But in Japan's maledominant society is Katsumi's manner less socially acceptable and more demure than Tampopo 1986 the liberated single working mother and restaurant owner?My mother enjoys cultural affinity with the picturesque scenes of Japan's Kansai area and the colorful performances by the Takarazuka Matsubayashi ensemble. The onlocation cinematography for Sayonara is outstanding together with the art and set direction the sound and supporting roles of Buttons and Umeki winning four Awards of ten Academy nominations. The film's core and it's frills are much better than some were willing to concede over concerns for cultural insensitivity  the direction screenplay production values and supporting cast with James Garner Patricia Owens and Ricardo Montalban are first rate.The Korean War  which began with North Korea unilaterally entering South Korea on 25 June 1950  will be remembered with controversy. It was the war where President Harry Truman fired commanding General Douglas MacArthur  a bona fide hero in the Pacific revered in the Philippines and respected in Japan. It was the war where we learned of Russian made MIG15 jets T34 tanks and AK47 assault rifles  and of the persistence and numerical superiority of Chinese troops. We learned the names of far away places like Seoul Pusan Inchon Panmunjon Pyongyang Yalu River and the 38th Parallel. We learned  with three million civilian and military casualties and after a negotiated peace and armistice in 195253  that nothing of substance changed. North and South Korea remained enemies for more than fifty years and we should have learned to respect opponents with great resolve.After the Korean War the United States failed to win another ground war in Viet Nam in the 1970s with another three million civilian and military casualties  against an enemy of even greater resolve. Possessing the most feared weaponry in world history and demonstrating unmatched ability to destroy all life via air warfare the US has failed to win two consecutive ground wars. The equation for winning a ground war is corollary to that of WINNING THE PEACE. In large part it requires gaining the hearts and minds of the people and the major weapon  the only acceptable weapon  is a strategic resourceful and patient diplomacy. It has to be better than sixty million civilian and military deaths in the twentieth century.".

Two American service men finds old world Japanese women more attractive than women from their own country. Major Gruver Marlon Brando stationed in Itami Japan is asked by his superior to convince his crew chief Airmen Joe Kelly Red Buttons to break off engagement with Katsumi Miyoshi Umeki  a Japanese girl. Interracial marriage was eschewed at the time and somewhat thought to be out of form for Americans to marry an Asian especially the Japanese who were their enemies in the recent war. Major Gruver tries to convince Joe that fine real American woman is what's really worth marrying until he is introduced to Hanaogi Miiko Taka by Joe and Katsumi.This movie was ground breaking in so many ways when it was released. Usage of James Michener's story who was known to write many international themed movies was a fresh move for Hollywood and it was one of the first movie not to stereotype Asians as Charlie Chan type characters. It was also one of the first movie to cast Japanese as Japanese in their roles not Americans with an Asian make up  well not completely as Ricardo Montalban's character shows and Hanaogi was supposed to be played by Audrey Hepburn until she declined the part . In any case the main characters were played by Brando and a new comer who was working as a travel agent in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles at the time Miiko Taka. She was one of the first Asian woman to portray Asians in their native role. Likes of her showed that Asians can portray themselves much better than an American actors posing as Asians. She also showed that Asian beauty can be on equal footings with their counterparts which began the paradigm shift to cast Asians in their native role in Hollywood movies.Marlon Brando may have been a rebel but had no nonsense attitude about things. He was sensible in many ways about life which was taken to be unconventional at the time but became more of a norm in society in subsequent years. Attitude of Major Gruver somewhat reflects his no nonsense ways he had with society and he was the perfect actor to play the part. Miiko Taka had an outstanding regal presence in this movie. She was no second fiddle to anybody and was perfect for her role as well.The movie has style and beauty all its own. Situations between the casts were very romantic. The movie showed that it's cool to date an Asian woman which today no one even thinks twice about. A great movie in its production and style and stands as a classic all on its own.".

Sayonara won 7 Oscars including Best Film Best Director Best Leading Actor Brando Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress. The Bridge on the River Kwai also won 7 Oscars including Best Film Best Director and Best Leading Actor Alec Guiness. But Bridge rates higher on this site and is generally considered a film classic.Sayonara was adapted from a James Michener novel. He had personal reasons for writing about JapaneseAmerican relations being married to a Japanese woman. The film was directed by Joshua Logan who at this point in his directing career was a proved commodity. His next film would be Michener's South Pacific. Brando's last film prior to Sayonara was Teahouse of the August Moon.It is easy to see that Hollywood was dealing with JapaneseAmerican relations in plenty of its films. And racism was a significant factor in the story.The main theme of Sayonara is racism. It considers both sides of the equationthe prejudice against Americans by some Japanese especially as personified by the character HanaOgi who hates Americans because they bombed her family and the prejudice of Americans toward the Japanese especially as portrayed by Brando as Major Gruver a career military pilot. Both characters undergo transformation in their viewpoints when exposed to members of the other race.The film eventually turns into a love story about two couples who wish to bridge the cultural gap. It is a tender sensitive story with important things to say.The cast is great. I won't single out anyone because they all are worthy of acclaim.This film deserves to be seen due to its courageous point of view and its place in film history as a milestone on the road to racial tolerance.Special note should be given to the sensitive way Japanese culture is depicted with patient portrayals of Kabuki and the meditation that is the Japanese tea ceremony.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having borrowed this movie from the local library a couple of weeks ago intending to originally see this on or a few days after Memorial Day I finally got to seeing Sayonara just this morning. In this one Marlon Brando plays Major Lloyd Ace Gruver a General's son who's been raised a certain way being transfered from Korea to Japan where his girlfriend Eileen Webster Patricia Owens conveniently happens to be. Before leaving he tries to persuade one of his men a Joe Kelly Red Buttons out of marrying Japanese woman Katsumi Miyoshi Umeki since that's a violation of military fraternization laws. With the romance of him and Eileen on the outs however Ace not only becomes the best man at Joe and Katsumi's wedding he falls for an Asian himself after he and Captain Mike Bailey James Garner go out on the town and watch headlining entertainer Hanaogi Miiko Taka on stage. Bailey himself is dating one of the dancers FumikoSan Reiko Kuba. Eileen herself seems to have a fancy for one of the Kabuki performers Nakamura Ricardo Montalban. I'll stop right there and say that this was a mostly compelling drama about the prejudices concerning AmericanAsian relations of romance that was very touching from beginning to end. Even seeing Hispanic Montalban playing an Oriental isn't too embarrassing though it's a good thing his part is short. And there's some nice touches of humor like that of Brando's head hitting the top of Button's and Umeki's inside doorway more than once. Red and Miyoshi themselves deserve their Oscars especially Red with his defiant and proud emotions throughout. Rookie Garner before being cast in his legendary role on TV's Marverick is fine in his scenes with Brando and Miiko Taka shows great restraint in her initial characterization as an antiAmerican. While I've read there were some changes from James Michener's novel I can't imagine director Josha Logan who had previously adopted another Michener work into the Broadway musical South Pacific and would eventually make that into a movie as well not staying true to the original source. He certainly provided some inspiration with the ending scenes that made the heartbreaking earlier tragedy in the film a somewhat necessary plot twist. Some of the production numbers may have made the movie a little longish but otherwise Sayonara was wonderful educational experience about the '50s mores that permeated America and Japan at the time.".

In this one Marlon Brando plays Major Lloyd Ace Gruver a General's son who's been raised a certain way being transfered from Korea to Japan where his girlfriend Eileen Webster Patricia Owens conveniently happens to be. Before leaving he tries to persuade one of his men a Joe Kelly Red Buttons out of marrying Japanese woman Katsumi Miyoshi Umeki since that's a violation of military fraternization laws.

	schema:headline " MARKETA LAZAROVA Frantisek Vlacil 1967 12";
	schema:reviewBody "UK DVD label Second Run  which specializes in rare Eastern European classics  have over the last couple of years released a handful of films I have long yearned to watch and which as a result of this viewing of MARKETA LAZAROVA I've just ordered online Aleksander Ford's KNIGHTS OF THE TEUTONIC ORDER 1960 a disc which despite its being trimmed by the BBFC and in an altered aspect ratio I couldn't sensibly forego Jerzy Kawalerowicz's MOTHER JOAN OF THE ANGELS 1961 their very first release which I purchased in London last year Jan Nemec's THE PARTY AND THE GUESTS 1966 and debuting in a few days' time Miklos Jancso's THE ROUNDUP 1965.Unlike these movies I wasn't consciously aware of MARKETA LAZAROVA when the infectious buzz about its impending release hit the Internet but as I later found out the film was actually mentioned ever so fleetingly in one of my father's old movie magazines. Again when the DVD was eventually released there was a negative vibe about the alleged visual deficiencies of Second Run's disc but in hindsight these were quite needlessly exaggerated. Ultimately an awesome  and as it turned out essential  movie experience such as this one deserves to be seen right away and to keep waiting for that perfectly pristine print to rear its unlikely head is utterly pointless. Alas the Czech New Wave is still a largely undiscovered segment of cinema history for me so I am not in a position to suitably assess whether MARKETA LAZAROVA is indeed the greatest Czech movie ever made as it had been judged in a 1998 poll among 100 native film critics. Suffice it to say that this ostensibly obscure film has by now figured in a number of published alltime best polls and consequently its status is deservedly wellestablished. Hopefully as it was in my case Second Run's DVD will serve as the introduction to many an adventurous film enthusiast in the future Since my overall experience of MARKETA LAZAROVA was such a positive one it seems only right to get my quibbles with the film out of the way first and there are basically two of them a muddled storyline which for most of the film's first half left me rather perplexed as to which of the two warring factions the characters whose exploits I was following on screen belonged and while things got clearer as time went by the individuals themselves with the obvious exception of the titular character did not exactly garner much sympathy. I suppose that for a movie with a running time of almost three hours these flaws would usually be significantly detrimental to one's enjoyment of the whole however the definite impression I was left with while watching was that despite the eponymous title the director's intent was not to narrate a conventional life history but actually to create a visual tapestry of the medieval era onto celluloid and in this regard to say that he succeeded would be the understatement of the year. In fact along with Andrei Tarkovsky's ANDREI RUBLEV shot in 1965 but actually unreleased until 1972 I'd venture to say that MARKETA LAZAROVA is the most convincingly realized cinematic portrait of those turbulent times distinguishing Frantisek Vlacil's vision as an overwhelmingly expansive and stunningly visual one.In this context it is quite appropriate that the titular character played by a future Presidential candidate the beautiful Magda Vasaryova is practically silent for most of the film she is first seen about to enter into a holy order but is eventually abducted raped and impregnated by the feral Mikolas who was actually raised by wolves whom she comes to love eventually. Another parallel and equally unlikely relationship we are witness to is the one which blossoms between the earthy Alexandria who is also involved in some brief but startling instances of fullfrontal nudity and her young aristocratic captive who happens to be a German Bishop it is worth noting here that Alexandria had already almost cost the life of her brother Adam when his own father had severed his arm in punishment for their incestuous coupling! Interestingly the film is divided into two parts  respectively entitled Straba and The Lamb Of God  and punctuated by frequent verbose half Dickensianhalf picaresque chapter headings not to mention the presence on the soundtrack of a bemused narrator who at one point even takes on the role of God while interacting with a monk!

	onyx:emotionText "UK DVD label Second Run  which specializes in rare Eastern European classics  have over the last couple of years released a handful of films I have long yearned to watch and which as a result of this viewing of MARKETA LAZAROVA I've just ordered online Aleksander Ford's KNIGHTS OF THE TEUTONIC ORDER 1960 a disc which despite its being trimmed by the BBFC and in an altered aspect ratio I couldn't sensibly forego Jerzy Kawalerowicz's MOTHER JOAN OF THE ANGELS 1961 their very first release which I purchased in London last year Jan Nemec's THE PARTY AND THE GUESTS 1966 and debuting in a few days' time Miklos Jancso's THE ROUNDUP 1965.Unlike these movies I wasn't consciously aware of MARKETA LAZAROVA when the infectious buzz about its impending release hit the Internet but as I later found out the film was actually mentioned ever so fleetingly in one of my father's old movie magazines. Again when the DVD was eventually released there was a negative vibe about the alleged visual deficiencies of Second Run's disc but in hindsight these were quite needlessly exaggerated. Ultimately an awesome  and as it turned out essential  movie experience such as this one deserves to be seen right away and to keep waiting for that perfectly pristine print to rear its unlikely head is utterly pointless. Alas the Czech New Wave is still a largely undiscovered segment of cinema history for me so I am not in a position to suitably assess whether MARKETA LAZAROVA is indeed the greatest Czech movie ever made as it had been judged in a 1998 poll among 100 native film critics. Suffice it to say that this ostensibly obscure film has by now figured in a number of published alltime best polls and consequently its status is deservedly wellestablished. Hopefully as it was in my case Second Run's DVD will serve as the introduction to many an adventurous film enthusiast in the future Since my overall experience of MARKETA LAZAROVA was such a positive one it seems only right to get my quibbles with the film out of the way first and there are basically two of them a muddled storyline which for most of the film's first half left me rather perplexed as to which of the two warring factions the characters whose exploits I was following on screen belonged and while things got clearer as time went by the individuals themselves with the obvious exception of the titular character did not exactly garner much sympathy. I suppose that for a movie with a running time of almost three hours these flaws would usually be significantly detrimental to one's enjoyment of the whole however the definite impression I was left with while watching was that despite the eponymous title the director's intent was not to narrate a conventional life history but actually to create a visual tapestry of the medieval era onto celluloid and in this regard to say that he succeeded would be the understatement of the year. In fact along with Andrei Tarkovsky's ANDREI RUBLEV shot in 1965 but actually unreleased until 1972 I'd venture to say that MARKETA LAZAROVA is the most convincingly realized cinematic portrait of those turbulent times distinguishing Frantisek Vlacil's vision as an overwhelmingly expansive and stunningly visual one.In this context it is quite appropriate that the titular character played by a future Presidential candidate the beautiful Magda Vasaryova is practically silent for most of the film she is first seen about to enter into a holy order but is eventually abducted raped and impregnated by the feral Mikolas who was actually raised by wolves whom she comes to love eventually. Another parallel and equally unlikely relationship we are witness to is the one which blossoms between the earthy Alexandria who is also involved in some brief but startling instances of fullfrontal nudity and her young aristocratic captive who happens to be a German Bishop it is worth noting here that Alexandria had already almost cost the life of her brother Adam when his own father had severed his arm in punishment for their incestuous coupling! Interestingly the film is divided into two parts  respectively entitled Straba and The Lamb Of God  and punctuated by frequent verbose half Dickensianhalf picaresque chapter headings not to mention the presence on the soundtrack of a bemused narrator who at one point even takes on the role of God while interacting with a monk!

	schema:reviewBody "I bought the Second Run DVD after reading about how this epic was considered the best Czech film ever.To be honest not many other contenders spring to mind. And who voted? As it was on special offer and I am a sucker indeed for that Russian style of gritty monochrome composition and beauty how could I resist?I'm on its second play and I'm no nearer following the story. There is undoubtedly one. Am I too overawed by imagery that I could only dream of? even if I were able to! Is it the savagery and feel of a certain reality?I don't know. I can sense however an art film made with passion and unbounded imagination. Of folklore both in a historical sense and a cultural one and of religious rebellion. Like Kurosawa at his best an immediacy and connection. Yet it is also dreamlike and distant with an air of mysticism that I found increasingly confusing. The length of film means that by halfway through I've no idea what is going on but am still enjoying what I see.Unfortunately I have docked a mark for the forced electronically induced echo on the dialogue that probably is supposed to denote that other worldly strangeness. It seems to seep in and hang about its constant use here cheapens the effect to being a bit of a pain. Whereas Kurosawa used that SFX so effectively on say Roshomon by using just once or twice.I could see elements of the Brazilian 'Black God White Devil' and like others have commented Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' and Tarkov's 'Andrei Rublev'. Maybe some of the black magic in Bergman's late medieval classics such as 'The Virgin Spring' and 'The Seventh Seal'. But more psychotic more manic and disturbing than all these put together. Like madness itself there is a real beauty deeply ingrained amongst the mayhem.My conclusion would have to be that if you get the chance go for it. Take it with a large pinch of salt and sprinkle sparingly. None of it is truly horrific or unpalatable to most adults and don't worry if you don't get it. Be slightly proud and immodest that you've found a tarnished gem that hardly anyone else will have seen or are ever likely to.".

As it was on special offer and I am a sucker indeed for that Russian style of gritty monochrome composition and beauty how could I resist?I'm on its second play and I'm no nearer following the story. There is undoubtedly one. Am I too overawed by imagery that I could only dream of? even if I were able to! Is it the savagery and feel of a certain reality?I don't know. I can sense however an art film made with passion and unbounded imagination. Of folklore both in a historical sense and a cultural one and of religious rebellion. Like Kurosawa at his best an immediacy and connection. Yet it is also dreamlike and distant with an air of mysticism that I found increasingly confusing. The length of film means that by halfway through I've no idea what is going on but am still enjoying what I see.Unfortunately I have docked a mark for the forced electronically induced echo on the dialogue that probably is supposed to denote that other worldly strangeness. It seems to seep in and hang about its constant use here cheapens the effect to being a bit of a pain. Whereas Kurosawa used that SFX so effectively on say Roshomon by using just once or twice.I could see elements of the Brazilian 'Black God White Devil' and like others have commented Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' and Tarkov's 'Andrei Rublev'. Maybe some of the black magic in Bergman's late medieval classics such as 'The Virgin Spring' and 'The Seventh Seal'. But more psychotic more manic and disturbing than all these put together. Like madness itself there is a real beauty deeply ingrained amongst the mayhem.My conclusion would have to be that if you get the chance go for it. Take it with a large pinch of salt and sprinkle sparingly. None of it is truly horrific or unpalatable to most adults and don't worry if you don't get it. Be slightly proud and immodest that you've found a tarnished gem that hardly anyone else will have seen or are ever likely to.";

There is a story here somewhere but unfortunately since so many of the characters look alike and the editing makes it impossible to tell whether you're seeing flashbacks or just moving to new scenes and the dialog offers no help in delineating the plot I could only tell that some medieval people were trying to kill each othersomething about a robbery but then the robber seems to have caught another robber robbing the same people and took him hostage other people got away and were taken hostage who I couldn't figure out someone's daughter is a nun maybe or a pagan witch or some convoluted excuse to show her nakedin other words the story is an absolute mess. Others have praised what they call a nonlinear plot. I don't mind a nonlinear plot at all but for this film the phrase is no better than an excuse for bad storytelling.".

Another Vlacil film just as unique in its own way that is not available is The White Dove. Marketa Lazarova is very realistic in detail as other reviewers have remarked but unlike some recent American and British films set in the Middle Ages it does not make a fetish of the dirt and squalor. The cruelty is also shown in the context of a harsh world where revenge and displays of power were necessary to maintain one's position. And it goes with the sardonic humor of the film. The only knight in shining armor for instance is an ineffectual status symbol. But the film also portrays a conflict in which both sides have their virtues the bonds of family affection and loyalty in the outlaw clan which come out in the father's final scene with his dying son and the king's effort to maintain some semblance of order that will allow ordinary people to live their lives. By contrast most American and British medieval epics are fantasies featuring a struggle between stereotyped good versus evil characters.".

It was not the rape scene itself that bothered me but the fact that the perpetrator was the lead male character whom we were evidently expected to feel some sympathy for as the film progressed. I also didn't like the fact that the titular female character seemed to promptly fall in love with her rapist for no apparent reason.It might be that if this element of the plot had been portrayed slightly differently then I wouldn't have had any problem with it but as it stands I found it extremely offputting. Personally I wouldn't even class this film as controversial it is just that I think that the aftermath of the rape and the subsequent relationship between the two central characters was depicted in a cackhanded manner. Although I usually want and expect creators to refrain from transferring present day social mores on to the past in this particular instance such theoretical considerations didn't obviate my adverse reaction to how the plot proceeded. As I have previously appreciated plenty of controversial content I didn't feel inclined to give this film the benefit of the doubt. It also is fairly obvious that the director has a penchant for gratuitous female nudity. I certainly wouldn't recommend this film to anybody who identified as a feminist. However there were aspects of this film that I did appreciate and I can fully understand why others would rate it very highly. Chief among these is the verisimilitude of the medieval setting. I enjoyed seeing all the dirt and the mud and all the buildings looked suitably dilapidated. The music helped to create an appropriate atmosphere and the cast and their clothing were similarly well chosen. I also liked the cinematography and the frequent use of unusual and interestingly varied camera angles.

What had been passed through the blood for centuries in the Teutonic woods as the only means of arranging the world in some order this instinctive violence was now felt to be abominable.In this sense the religious angst of the medieval man comes from trying to conciliate that ancestral world where carving a blood eagle on the back of a fallen chieftain pleased the gods with the new ideas of perceiving it where sins had to be atoned for.Here we get the tumultuous chronicle of this the writing of the middle part of history.We get baroque medieval art steeped in religious terror and ancestral guilt. Chances are there's a slew of medieval films out there but probably not one that is as pungent with a single exception. We encounter this cruel pitiless hell on earth where life is meaningless and crazed gods roaming it exact terrible ironic tolls on the human soul ten years later in Diabel by the hand of a certified madman this time.Spiritually I couldn't be farther apart from this godless vision of tortured human beings essentially Christian. But as an experience to dwell upon and inhabit the film offers no quarter. It's a better Valhalla Rising thirty years before.What new frameworks here though how best to experience the torture of the medieval man? The director finds the answer in the Czech New Wave.The intertitle that opens this delineates what follows as a saga an epic story of murder and intrigue. The masterstroke here lies in how this saga is told in fragmenting it from a linear notion where time is a succession which is the artifice of history and presenting us with those fragments as a vivid experience of a life bled for and anguished. Which is to say Marketa Lazarova is not the history of what transpired but the memory of it which is then arranged into a story.The camera then sees inside this story deeper than any bard did. And what it sees is that these passions and sufferings are not linear therefore building up to something or anticipated to come to an end that would justify the pain but an exponential cycle turning indifferently and without pattern. Yet here is where the film falters. Having broken this up the film shies away from the opportunity to look directly at what hides behind it if anything and insists we read this as a rhapsody where it's not impossible to consider the degenerate as cruel flawed heroes who defied the king's rule. Bombastic music swells up in crescendos now and then to remind us that all this is horrible but fundamentally tragic.This may be a quibble however. It's a harrowing experience watching these men small and insignificant at the face of violence struggle with a pain and madness immemorial that predates their existence. Omens of skaldic doom abound here black crows in the bony branches of trees. Whatever they signify or not whether the gods cackle at all this or are indifferently absent these sights curdle the blood.".

She would go on to an almost 25 year career in films before retiring in 1991. Famed director Frantisek Vlcil is at the peak of his directorial career with this film he adapted from the very popular novel by Vladislav Vancura. It took two years to film this in mostly winter scenes in the forests of southern Czechoslovakia. It is set in the 13th century and details the medieval era clash of two rival clans paganism and Christianity a doomed love affair between Mikolas and Marketa and the poor rural class living under the king. The runtime of the print I saw was 152 minutes. Good music and some great visuals but not that visually rewarding probably due to the quality of the print and far from the epic I thought it would be. Nice to see on the big screen but I would wait for a properly restored cleaned up DVD version. It lasted about an hour too long. This is not for everybody and I couldn't recommend it. I had every expectation of liking it but it grew boring. I would give it a 5.5 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this Czech film listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die it is one of only a few films that have got attention or reviews from critics so I just watched to make my own mind up about it. Basically set in the Middle Ages two brothers Mikols Frantisek Veleck and onearmed Adam Ivan Palch are robbers who steal from travellers for their tyrannical father Kozlk Josef Kemr. During one of their jobs they end up having to hold a young German hostage the hostage's father escapes and reports the news of her kidnapping and the robbery to the King. Kozlk is prepared for the wrath of the King he sends Mikols to pressure his neighbour Lazar Michal Kozuch to join him in war the persuasion fails and in vengeance Mikols abducts Lazar's virginal naive daughter Marketa Lazarov Magda Vsryov just as she was about to join a convent to become a nun. In the meantime the King dispatches an army and Lazar who is religious will be called upon to join hands against Kozlk. I will be honest and say that I did not understand absolutely everything going on but there is a plot about the shift from Paganism to Christianity. Also starring Zdenek Kryznek as Captain Beer and Pavla Polaskova as Alexandra with narration by Zdenek Stepnek. Even though I couldn't follow everything because I had to read subtitles this blackandwhite film set in medieval times had some good moments with themes of religion kidnapping by robbers and the hostage becoming the mistress of one of the kidnappers being interesting maybe if critics wrote a review I could make more of a determined judgement for me it was a reasonable historical drama. Worth watching!".

The films atmosphere  similar to another medieval film Andrei Rublev  really makes you feel like you have traveled to the middle ages. This is by no means a feel good movie and the loss for human compassion is pushed to the extreme. If you are looking for traditional linear storytelling you will be disappointed with this movie. Marketa Lazarov compromises everything for the atmosphere of the movie Visual Sound Story Characters and so on. This does not damage the film though Marketa Lazarov is a much better film because of it.

The scene is so well written and handled that parents could actually use it to break the ice in the discussion of sex with their children.  I did.  The girls then proceed to steal the boy's clothes and are chased on their bicycles by the four boys who are seen nude from the rear.

The script soars with female teenage humor friendship and prepuberty naivete  a sprightly soundtrack of 70s tunes takes older viewers down memory lane. But then just when the story about four best friends during summer vacation in a new housing development is clipping along at a compelling pace SLAM! The film jumps forward 20 years and the girls are grownups. And at these points the movie groans along like a garbage disposal with too many potato peels crammed in it.Remarkably the dismal acting of these veteran actresses isn't as bad as the lackluster script during these flashfronts. Were there separate writers for this film? I usually adore Rosie O'Donnell but casting her as the grown Roberta was a horrible choice. Demi Moore's character is now selfabsorbed and selfpitying and Melanie Griffin superfamous actress and Rita Wilson pregnant homemaker are insipid caricatures. None of these women are onequarter as interesting or delightful as they were when they were adolescents particularly Roberta RicciO'Donnell. The film's flipping back and forth between the decades becomes quickly annoying.Suggestion Rent the video and fastforward through the adult stuff. Fastforwarding the tape won't rob anyone of the film's message something like friendship is forever or don't go into cemeteries at night and it'll save you about 30 minutes of fidgeting waiting for the film to turn back to the four girls. At least they have fun. And the treehouse they save up to buy is every girl's idea of truly cool!".

The excellent soundtrack just adds to the uplifting feeling of this film. Watch as we follow Christina Richie and friends growing up through fun times Devon Sawa getting his clothes stolen and bad times Richie finding out how her mum died.

Best compared to Stand By Me and Man in the Moon this tender movie gently touches base with the delicate time period when young girls experience the confusions and emotions that are present in the process of puberty.The plots happens over the eventful summer of 1970. The film details the lives of four best friends Samantha Gaby Hoffmann Teeny Thora Birch Roberta Christina Ricci and Chrissy Ashleigh Aston Moore. During this summer the girls find it necessary to ware bras for the first time in their lives a factor in which they have varied feelings. This is also the summer where they discover their town's horrifying secret about a young boy who mysteriously died thirty years ago. Pursuing the girls are the neighbor boys named the Wormers.The film is told in the present through the girls who are now adults. The adult actresses including Rosie O'Donnell Rita Wilson Demi Moore and Melanie Griffith appear only as wraparound bookends to fill the audience's desire to see whom the girls turn out to be. However they are not examined in enough detail to fulfill these desires.Now and Then filmmakers describe the characters descriptively and vividly with believable character traits like curiosity and lively spirit. They are very well cast by some of Hollywood's biggest names who perform with a sweet gentle fitting attitude. The movie's actors are willing to give more than the script allows.The problem lies not within character however but in plot. The film seems unclear of what it is about whether it wants to detail the lives of four adolescent girls discovering the death of Dear Johnny childhood mischief the story is so easily distracted. The film persistently adds in unnecessary clichs and predictable character formality involving relationship conflicts and novice romances. Yet at the same time the plot is executed artistically with an enjoyable sense of style and an effective mood along with a soundtrack that is true to the 70's era.Now and Then is the kind of movie that relies entirely on subplots to propel its distracted story line along. I compare the film's structure to that of a deformed tree where there are plenty of narrative roots and the story branches off in many directions but it does not have a thick trunk for support.".

Reading through a lot of the comments I noticed that many compared this film to Rob Reiner's Stand By Me. I guess I would consider the two to be of the same genre coming of age but to me that's really the only thing the two have in common.Now and Then is a fun film. It's got quick and easy laughs that many not just teenage girls people will find humorous. I will say that Then is vastly more entertaining than Now the adult versions of the characters briefly open and close the story with forgettable filler in between. Then offers some slight depth of character for the four girls who embody stereotypes of adolescent girls the princess the tomboy the sheltered one the seemingly normal one. Now still embraces those stereotypes the princess has become an actress still obsessed with body image the normal one has become a writer who showcases her intellect by wearing black and smoking. There is no growth amongst the adults. Now is focused on Chrissy's pregnancy and reminiscing while Then seems to get distracted amongst its various subplots unraveling Crazy Pete watching parents fight bicker with boys watch movies build a tree house ride bikes without ever really coming to a true conclusion.For a movie hailed as a Stand By Me for girls the film is lacking in its overall sincerity. Whereas Reiner's film grapples and in some cases overcomes 'mature' themes like death acceptance and separation Glatter's film skates over the big issues. Stand By Me captures true childhood friendship friends help friends get leeches off their backs Now and Then is only truly poignant well now and then.I'd recommend Now and Then for a time when you are in the mood for something lighthearted and distracting. I'd second the opinion that it's great for a girl's sleepover or something. But if you are looking for something a little deeper and in my opinion more true to childhood friendship I'd tell you to skip this movie and go straight to Stand By Me. Note Stand By Me is rated R Now and Then PG13. Both films have great soundtracks.".

	schema:reviewBody "Enough reviewers here on IMDb have made a comparison of this film to Stand By Me that for me to mention it it would be redundant. Nevertheless the story did have a Stephen King vibe to it for a number of other reasons. It's a small town coming of age story told in flashback with the character of Samantha Demi Moore narrating her experiences in the past and present with her closest childhood friends. The King novel It admittedly a horror story possibly serves as a better comparison to Now and Then in as much as both have a cast of characters who have made a pact to reassemble as adults if any one of them needs help for a stressful situation. If that weren't enough the storm drain scene had me dreading some demonic clown villain reaching out and grabbing Samantha to pull her under until I realized that as the narrator she would have to have survived that awful experience in order to tell the tale. Though on the surface the picture is positioned as one for women and young girls I think there's some value in applying a more global perspective to the idea of nurturing friendship and loyalty throughout one's lifetime with those we grew up with. The four teen girls in the picture stuck together through thick and thin searching for the truth about their home town and it's past secrets in a way that helped them grow as individuals. Realizing that not everything can be perfect in one's life is an important lesson to learn and having a support system to help one grow through those rough patches is a valuable memory one can look back on as the years roll by.I liked the way the picture weaved the Crazy PeteDear Johnny subtext into the story and how it helped Samantha come to grips with the father that abandoned her family. That dynamic further reinforced an idea offered by the returning Vietnam vet Brendan Fraser who's best advice to the girls had particular resonance in hindsight  You can believe in yourself if you're lucky.".

	schema:reviewBody "I see a lot of people comparing this movie to Stand By Me but the problem with that is if you were old enough to see Stand By Me when it was first released then hate to break it to you but this movie is not targeted at your demographic. Just because something feels like a remake of a movie made a decade before does not mean that the new movie is in anyway terrible. Take Heathers and Mean Girls for example both good movies but in my opinion Mean Girls appealed to me more as it was aimed at my demographic. If you can't judge a movie on it's own merits than perhaps you need to chill a little.Anyway Now and Then is one of those movies that sticks with you for life. Recently I just converted a friend of mine in her mid twenties to loving this movie. I was dumbfounded that she had missed this right of passage that most young girls had when this movie was released. Every girl can relate to one of the four characters and it reminds you of a simpler time where all that mattered were boys having fun and navigating your way through growing up. I still remember taking Cosmo quizzes and thinking they had an insight into your soul preparing for your first kiss and investing in my first bra. I know there are a lot of parents who think this movie is overly sexualised but guess what when your kid is going through puberty nothing will turn them back into your precious little angel. Accept it and hope they have supportive friends who they can share their journey with.If you watch the movie with an open heart you will find a great cast that feels real in their characters a brilliant soundtrack that increases your nostalgia level and a deep and meaningful storyline. It deals with subject matter that many adolescent movies steer clear of just because you are young does not mean you haven't experienced hurt and pain like an adult. Adolescents needs to know that life is not always perfect and that there will be ups and downs but everyone is all in it together. I cannot strongly recommend this movie enough if you are willing to enjoy this movie for what it is a fantastic coming of age movie.".

So most of the movie has four 12yrold actresses playing the roles but the beginning and end are the mature actresses playing their older selves. One is a doctor another is a writer yet another is an actress while one stayed in town and is about to have a baby.The summer of 1970 has the girls playing in the cemetery at night and seeing a tombstone of a boy their age 12 buried in 1945. Part of their quest is to find out who this boy was and how he died. They have a number of experiences some with the local bullies four brothers. And some adventures are unpleasant involving friction in families. But somehow they survive and finally finding out about the dead boy had some life lessons.Overall a really good movie. Shot in and around Savannah Georgia.".

Part of their quest is to find out who this boy was and how he died. They have a number of experiences some with the local bullies four brothers. And some adventures are unpleasant involving friction in families. But somehow they survive and finally finding out about the dead boy had some life lessons.Overall a really good movie. Shot in and around Savannah Georgia.";

It's a ridiculous silly sex comedy with an abundance of gags about sex and cleavage like many 1960s comedies. In the 60s the restrictive Hays Code was lifted so films were able to make jokes like that and show a moderate amount of nudity. So when you look at it from that perspective of course Hollywood would go a little nuts making T  A jokes! Dirty Dingus Magee is the name of Frank Sinatra's character he's a womanizing thief who talks his way out of many sticky situations. The film starts as George Kennedy reunites with Frank he's not happy to see him and we soon find out why. Frankie talks and talks and before we know it he's robbed George of his nest egg and his favorite hat! The rest of the movie is a tugofwar between George and Frankie trying to rob fight arrest and get ahead of the other. It's set in the Wild West so there are cowboys Indians stagecoaches and babes in brothels galore! As silly as it isand it is really sillyI actually thought this movie was very funny. George and Frankie have great chemistry together and both their comedic timings are excellent. It's fast paced and doesn't milk the same joke over and over. Once a gag's been done Joseph Heller and Tom and Frank Waldman write a new one equally lighthearted and funny. If you've had a hard week rent Dirty Dingus Magee and take a load offjust hold on to your hat!".

	schema:headline " Two Dumb Outlaws";
	schema:reviewBody "Dirty Dingus Magee 1970  out of 4 Dimwitted outlaw Dingus Magee Frank Sinatra runs into old friend Hoke Birdsill George Kennedy and robs him of 400. Hoke goes into the next town looking for a sheriff but finds the town not to have one but the Mayor Anne Jackson who also happens to run the local whore house gives him the job so Hoke sets out to capture Magee but it turns out both are so stupid they keep up making new agreements to become rich.DIRTY DINGUS MAGEE was a commercial and critical flop when it was originally released and star Sinatra pretty much gave up the acting career until 1977 when he made a television movie and then tried one more theatrical comeback in 1980. This film has been beaten to death by many critics but I think they were a tad bit unfair. Yes the film isn't nearly as funny as it should have been and yes perhaps Sinatra could have been more interested in doing better movies at the times but looking back on this film it's a pretty innocent film that manages a few nice laughs and there's no question that there are some good supporting performances.Director Burt Kennedy directed countless Westerns in his career including some that mixed comedy in including SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF. This film manages to get a few nice laughs as both Sinatra and Kennedy's characters set up deals with each other but the two men are just so stupid that one has to cross the other but then isn't smart enough to get away. The majority of the comedy comes from small simple scenes where Sinatra gets in trouble and then has to knock out Kennedy or vice versa. There's a strong supporting group of players who also throw into the dumbness of the characters.As far as the performances go Sinatra really isn't too bad here but it's clear he really wasn't giving it his all. He had proved that he could be a great actor so it's easy to see why many critics felt he was sleepwalking in movies like this. Kennedy on the other hand is extremely good and manages to show off what a good comedic actor he was long before THE NAKED GUN series. The supporting cast contains good performances from Jack Elam who gets to play John Wesley Hardin and Lois Nettleton is great as a nymphomaniac who doesn't want to admit it. Jackson is also charming in her role as the Mayor and Michele Carey is good as the Indian woman who takes care of Dingus.DIRTY DINGUS MAGEE certainly isn't a masterpiece as there are a great number of flaws. The biggest flaw is that there's really not much of a story as the same type of situation just keeps happening over and over. There's also an extremely long shoot out at the end of the picture which just drags on and on. Still fans of this type of film will want to check it out as there are a few nice laughs and there's no doubt that the supporting actors are quite good.".

	onyx:emotionText "Dirty Dingus Magee 1970  out of 4 Dimwitted outlaw Dingus Magee Frank Sinatra runs into old friend Hoke Birdsill George Kennedy and robs him of 400. Hoke goes into the next town looking for a sheriff but finds the town not to have one but the Mayor Anne Jackson who also happens to run the local whore house gives him the job so Hoke sets out to capture Magee but it turns out both are so stupid they keep up making new agreements to become rich.DIRTY DINGUS MAGEE was a commercial and critical flop when it was originally released and star Sinatra pretty much gave up the acting career until 1977 when he made a television movie and then tried one more theatrical comeback in 1980. This film has been beaten to death by many critics but I think they were a tad bit unfair. Yes the film isn't nearly as funny as it should have been and yes perhaps Sinatra could have been more interested in doing better movies at the times but looking back on this film it's a pretty innocent film that manages a few nice laughs and there's no question that there are some good supporting performances.Director Burt Kennedy directed countless Westerns in his career including some that mixed comedy in including SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF. This film manages to get a few nice laughs as both Sinatra and Kennedy's characters set up deals with each other but the two men are just so stupid that one has to cross the other but then isn't smart enough to get away. The majority of the comedy comes from small simple scenes where Sinatra gets in trouble and then has to knock out Kennedy or vice versa. There's a strong supporting group of players who also throw into the dumbness of the characters.As far as the performances go Sinatra really isn't too bad here but it's clear he really wasn't giving it his all. He had proved that he could be a great actor so it's easy to see why many critics felt he was sleepwalking in movies like this. Kennedy on the other hand is extremely good and manages to show off what a good comedic actor he was long before THE NAKED GUN series. The supporting cast contains good performances from Jack Elam who gets to play John Wesley Hardin and Lois Nettleton is great as a nymphomaniac who doesn't want to admit it. Jackson is also charming in her role as the Mayor and Michele Carey is good as the Indian woman who takes care of Dingus.DIRTY DINGUS MAGEE certainly isn't a masterpiece as there are a great number of flaws.

A comment in another review on this site written by edshullivan in June of 2016 mentions that Frank Sinatra is too old for Michele Carey. I agree with that. Sinatra was 28 years older than Michele. However it was also mentioned that George Kennedy is far too old for Lois Nettleton. Actually George Kennedy was only two years older than Lois Nettleton. George was born in 1925 and Lois was born in 1927. Lois had one of the funniest parts in DDM as a nymphomaniac school teacher. She came on to every man she met!".

For most of the film he is wearing nothing more than a red single piece long john underwear and a really really I mean really bad teenager toupee that reminds me of Moe from the original Three Stooges. I guess the producers spent more on casting Sinatra in the lead role and ran out of money for a wardrobe designer?George Kennedy plays a hapless sap that keeps getting sucked in to Dirty Dingus Magee's schemes to make them both richer and richer. Of course there is a string of horny ladies from the local cathouse as well as the good looking actresses Lois Nettleton and Michele Carey who seem to be just dying to get into bed with these two over the hill actors Frank Sinatra and George Kennedy? Why are they so hot for lust with Dirty Dingus Magee and Hoke Birdsill? Well because that is probably the way Sinatra and Kennedy insisted the script be written to boost their aging egos. This is a lousy westerncomedy lacking any interest what so ever. Sinatra realized there was little interest in his screen appearances anymore from his hey days with earlier classic fine films like Pal Joey and Oceans 11 and so he only appeared in front of the camera four 4 more times spanning over the next 17 years.Sinatra was always a good looking lean suave and smooth singing crooner who had natural charisma. Unlike actors such as Sean Connery or even John Wayne who continued throughout their acting careers to hold their audiences attention and fascination Sinatra as Dirty Dingus Magee was a total bomb. I am glad I watched it because I felt it is like when you drive by a bad car accident you don't really want to see the carnage but human nature dictates you just have to take a look. And so I did with DDM I watched it and I can only rate it a 3 out of 10 for good picture quality and nothing else.".

Dirty Dingus Magee isn't as funny as the two Support Your Local spoofs that Kennedy helmed with James Garner. Part of the problem may be that Frank Sinatra doesn't make as amusing a protagonist as Garner. Furthermoreit isn't as funny as The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. Considering the remarkable writing talent involved in this snickering horse opera Dirty Dingus Magee should have emerged as far more than a fairtomiddling oater that generates its mirth from inconsistent helpings of satire double entendre and lowest common denominator slapstick that never really comes together with the cohesion of the Support westerns. Scenarists Tom Waldman of Inspector Clouseau Frank Waldman of The Return of the Pink Panther and Joseph Heller of Catch 22 make a formidable troika. They adapted David Markson's novel The Ballad of Dirty Dingus Magee and they had to change Markson's 19year old protagonist so that middleaged Frank Sinatra would be acceptable in the lead role. Unfortunately the humor here tends to more miss than hit and some of it may flies so quickly that it might be noticeable only during subsequent viewings. The best setpiece in this lighthearted sagebrusher takes place when Brigadier General George John Dehner of The LeftHanded Gun orders an emergency retreat drill at a bordello and his halfclad troopers scramble out windows galore to mount their horses. Some of the oneliners are memorable too. Cathouse madam Belle Nops Anne Jackson of The Tiger Makes Out remarks to one of her girls These army drills are hard on the girls. Belle's girl China Poppy Marya Thomas of Stay Away Joe replies Soldiers hard on too. Occasionally Kennedy replays one of his better Support Your Local Sheriff gags when our hero Dingus Magee struggles to open a strongbox festooned with chains. Magee wedges the box in the crotch of a tree ties a rope from it to his saddle pommel and then gallops away. Predictably instead of ripping the strongbox open Magee is jerked unceremoniously backwards off his horse. Occasionally Kennedy inserts quick antics like a cavalry trooper leaving a prostitute who hands him a rooster and tells him to take his cock with him. Incidentally the word dingus is Yiddish for penis.The shallow story concerns an insignificant outlaw with a 10 bounty on his head Dingus Magee Frank Sinatra of Sergeants 3 who is working at a stagecoach relay station when we first encounter him. A stagecoach stops to let the passengers stretch their legs and get a bite to eat. Magee recognizes his old friend Herkimer 'Hoke' Birdsill George Kennedy of Bandolero! but Hoke does his best to ignore him. Eventually Magee shows Hoke where he can urinate without attracting attention. When Hoke turns his back on Magee our antiheroic protagonist nudges him with a sixshooter and snatches his derby. All along Hoke has assured Magee that he has only seven dollars in his wallet. As it turns out Hoke has 400 stashed in his derby hat and Magee steals it. Later after the stagecoach pulls into the twobit town of Yerkey's Hole Hoke searches frantically for the sheriff and winds up discussing his predicament to Belle Nops the madam runs the bordello and serves a mayor. Belle appoints Hoke as sheriff and Dirty Dingus Magee depicts the back and forth shenanigans between Magee and Hoke as Hoke captures him and Magee escapes. Magee has a running romance with a young sexaddicted Indian maiden Anna Hot Water Michele Carey of El Dorado who utters everything in an infantile idiom. For example she refers to sex as bimbam. She addresses our hero as Dinggoose. When General George threatens to remove his troops because the local Native American population poses no threat to the settlers Belle and Hoke turn Dingus' escape from Hoke's jail into an Indian uprising.What possessed Frank Sinatra to this silly horse opera remains a mystery. He cavorts about in a toupee that makes him look like the largeeyed war orphan Dondi of the Gus Edson and Irwin Hasen comic strip that newspapers carried for thirty years. George Kennedy wears his attire so that he looks like Charlie Chaplin. A collection of seasoned western movie supporting actors including Jack Elam Don 'Red' Barry Henry Jones Paul Fix and Harry Carey Jr. show up for this halfbaked hilarity.

No wonder he only had one more starring role in his movie career. Dean Martin would have been a better actor to cast in this role. Dean featured the natural charm wit and humor that did not come as naturally to Sinatra. Look at Dean and George Kennedy in Something Big a western from 1971. Not a bad film. As for George Kennedy he doesn't do a bad job in this movie but this plot which is actually not so ludicrous is made ludicrous by the unfunny and constantly overly forced humor. I've only given two movies before this a 110 on IMDb and I've reviewed about 300 films so trust me and skip it even if you are a die hard Sinatra fan like I am.".

According to Hugh Fordin's book on Arthur Freed the next scheduled property was Good News but that got shelved for several years when Louis B. Mayer decided that a patriotic type theme was in order and after all MGM had bought the screen rights to the Gershwin musical Strike Up The Band. Freed agreed but in the Hollywood tradition only the title and the title song were retained for the screen.That was enough because the Mickey and Judy formula was by now established with Babes In Arms. Here the two are a pair of talented musical kids and Mickey is the drummer in his high school band. But he's got other things on his mind besides doing John Philip Sousa. Even Sousa did more than Sousa when he was leading a band. Mickey is filled with the new jive rhythms of the day and he'd like to use the other kids in the school orchestra to form a real band. He's got Garland in mind for the vocals and the object is to get an audition from Paul Whiteman.Whiteman in his day may have appropriated for himself the title of King Of Jazz but certainly no one did more to popularize the new American art form among white audiences. His orchestra was the training ground for many of later big band leaders. Leaders like Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey and Glenn Miller all who were sidemen with Whiteman and who kids like Mickey and Judy and the rest of the cast were listening to.If Strike Up The Band isn't exactly let's put on a show it still is let's put on a concert and Mickey and Judy do have some shtick to perform their Gay Nineties spoof is quite good. Also the fantasy sequence of the 'fruit orchestra' doing Our Love Affair is also nicely done it looks very much like Ray Harryhausen's claymation figures but he wasn't involved with Strike Up The Band.Strike Up The Band won one Academy Award for sound and was nominated for two others. Roger Edens and Arthur Freed wrote Our Love Affair which was nominated for Best Song but lost to When You Wish Upon A Star. And Edens and Georgie Stoll were nominated for Best Musical Scoring.Busby Berkeley directed the film and in the finale shows his fine hand for spectacle. Here's where the patriotism that Louis B. Mayer was seeking came out. Remember this was 1940 and a lot of people were very afraid the USA was going into another World War. The finale with the title song was the kind of rousing patriotic spectacle that Hollywood would be doing in every studio after December 7 1941.With Strike Up The Band Arthur Freed proved he was no flash in the pan as a producer. After 70 years the film holds up well and the talents of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland reign eternal.".

Visually Garland and Rooney make a cute couple a match clearly made in malt shop heaven. And even though I was disappointed I can understand Garland's enduring appeal. She's definitely an incandescent presence and one that doesn't come from just acting the part. On the other hand Rooney is energetic and I can see him organizing a high school band. However that energy too often becomes manicfor example check out his conducting the orchestra at movie's end for sheer pointless delirium. Too often his in yourface high spirits comes across as more obnoxious than entertaining.I guess my biggest disappointment is with the musical numbers. Berkeley's dancing phalanxes are eyecatching as usual but there's not a single catchy tune to hang your hat on. The numbers are simply not up to Garland's level of showstopping talent whatever the reason. Then there's the overlong melodrama skit that unfortunately saps momentum by coming in the middle. On the other hand the musical fruit sketch sounds silly but is really charming and well done. Also professional musician Paul Whiteman turns out to be a pretty darn good actor. And for those interested in what those times were like it's a chance to see what teens circa1940 thought was cool. Having your own dance band was clearly near the top. At the same time the message seems to be that dance bands deserve respect while playing in one is indeed a legitimate goal in life. Looks like controversies over music didn't start with rockandroll.".

On the other hand the musical fruit sketch sounds silly but is really charming and well done. Also professional musician Paul Whiteman turns out to be a pretty darn good actor. And for those interested in what those times were like it's a chance to see what teens circa1940 thought was cool. Having your own dance band was clearly near the top. At the same time the message seems to be that dance bands deserve respect while playing in one is indeed a legitimate goal in life. Looks like controversies over music didn't start with rockandroll.";

	schema:reviewBody "Warning! The corn grows high and the sap flows freely! Overall this is my least favorite of the 4 BW musical comedies from '39 '43 starring Mickey and Judy. Most of these including this one were actually musical extensions of the Andy Hardy series format. Hence extensive portions deal with the teenagers usually led by Mickey with Judy's support having to beg permission from authority figures including their parents to put on a musical or dramatic show and the practical problems of securing financing and an adequate place to put on the show.In this one Mickey as the bored drummer for the High School band leads a crusade to form a schoolsponsored dance band providing an opportunity for the other bored band members to play current pop music and hopefully making some money for the school and themselves. Judy backed by the rest of the glee club will do most of the singing. The principal gives his hesitant OK. Thus we have Busby Berkeley's spectacularly staged  manic La Conga Latinthemed dance production. There would be the roughly equivalent manic production Hoe Down at this spot in the subsequent Babes on Broadway Meanwhile Mickey talks to his 'pal' Judy about the problem of his mother expecting him to become a doctor like his dad while he thinks he's cut out to be a musician. Later we go through the same thing directly with his mother in quite a sappy scene. She's initially upset but eventually reluctantly agrees that he can try out his ambition. Later when the Paul Whiteman band miraculously shows up in town for Barbara's birthday Mickey is given an opportunity to turn professional when one of Whiteman's sidemen decides to form a new band. Initially ecstatic Mickey's mother reminds him that he is the leader of the HS dance band and their ambition to win Whiteman's content on his radio show. She suggests that his leadership role in the local community is presently more important than starting a career elsewhere. Reluctantly he agrees. Also meanwhile Judy is dissatisfied with her status as Mickey's 'pal'. She wants to be his acknowledged girlfriend expressed in song in Nobody. Unfortunately a very aggressive siren rich girlJune Preisser as Barbara Morganhas moved into town and immediately starts working on MickeyWhy? He wasn't handsome a star athlete nor wealthy. Of course Judy is jealous and Mickey very conflicted but Judy decides an uneasy cooperation with Barbara is the best policy for the present. As things turn out Barbara's father is the savior of the band's ambition to perform on the Whiteman show. At the last minute one band memberWillie needs a quick expensive operation draining the money raised for the trip to the showin a sappy scene.. Barbara's influential father is impressed and he arranges for a quick train trip for the band. Before this episode her father arranged for Whiteman's band to play at Barbara's birthday party giving Whiteman a chance to hear the dance band who play Drummer Boy with Whiteman's instruments Mickey being the manic drummer of course.The biggest problem with the film is the long mostly boring New Rochelle archaic drama in the middle. This includes all the stereotypical elements of bygone stage and silent film drama a villain trying to take advantage of a destitute young womanJudy a saviorMickey who marries her then eventually becomes a drunkard and wiles away all their money the girl being tied to a train track for refusing to give into the villain the savior tied to a logcutting machine about to be cut in half and a guardian angel in the form of their deceased son coming to untie Mickey so he can save Judy. The purpose of putting on this show was to raise money for their trip to Whiteman.After a sappy speech by Mickey the big somewhat flagwaving finale mostly consists of reprisals of the major songs with the Gershwincomposed title song the first and last featured. The most popular original song in the film Our Love Affair is redone with 4 large harps near the relevant MickeyJudy couple. The first time this was played Mickey wasn't thinking of Judy in a romantic context. This earlier rendition also included an animated nuts and fruit orchestra a rather novel gimmick for its day.This was the second and last time in this film series that dimpled babyfaced June Preisser played the obnoxious superrich siren competitor with Judy for Mickey's attention. Besides her looks and personality she was known for her gymnastic dancing and contortion skill which she very briefly gives samples of in this film. As in Babes in Arms she is directly or indirectly responsible for providing the money for the 'gang's' show biz ambitions. This time she participates in several productions including the finale without the bitter competition with Judy for the lead female show role as in Babes in Arms. Her film career ended in the late '40s when she was no longer wanted to play sexy high school girls.Ann Shoemaker switched from playing Judy's mother in Babes in Arms to being Mickey's mother in this film.Be sure to see the hilarious musical cartoon Romeo in Rhythm accompanying the current DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Right after the credits end the camera moves across an obvious teenaged band where the boys are obviously bored playing the official theme of the Air Force. All of a sudden the drummer adds a bit of boogie woogie into his one track beat and the teacher reminds him that they are not playing My Heart Belongs to Daddy. The drummer boy is of course Mickey Rooney who even today is still drummin' out small appearances in movies. When all of a sudden Judy Garland appears they start talking about putting together their own dance band with Judy as the vocalist and Mick as the conductor. Everything seems to be falling into place for them. It's a piece of cake. In fact that cake with a bunch of fruit ends up an orchestra of its own playing Our Love Affair in one of the most imaginative sequences on film. Its up there with Gene Kelly and Jerry the Mouse dancing in Anchors Aweigh as what made MGM musicals so imaginative.But things don't go smoothly of course. They need 200 to get to Chicago to audition for Paul Whiteman but miraculously Whiteman shows up in town to play at flirtatious June Preisser's birthday party. Mickey Judy and the gang take over. After earlier dancing to the La Conga where some of the high school dance band members appear to be a bit older they now perform Drummer Boy and knock Whiteman's socks off. Whiteman wants them on his show regardless for a contest of all the high school bands but when their pal Larry Nunn all of a sudden needs an operation for a broken arm there goes to 200. Ann Shoemaker steps in for Mickey's Andy Hardy ma Fay Holden as the wise mother who guides Mickey's conscience she's more like a female Judge Hardy and the diminutive Francis Pierlot is the kindly principal.This has nothing to do with the 1930 Broadway musical other than the title song. It's 1940's jitterbug all the way and Mickey and Judy give it their all. It's easy to see why they were the hottest team on the MGM lot and the most popular teens in America. Mickey can grate on occasion with energy but when he's serious he's at his best. In fact those sequences are often more touching than the comic sequences are amusing. As for Judy she gets another plain jane song I Ain't Got Nobody which is one of the most obscure list songs in history even dropping the names of Judy's bosses MGM within the list. Those bosses must have been blind to really see how lovely she was funny considering that half the movie Judy is trying to wake Mickey up to see her for who she is over the rather obnoxious Preisser. The recent TV movie about Judy Garland had director Busby Berkley demanding to see Judy's eyes and she really shows them here.Most famous of course is the duet of Our Love Affair but the overthetop finale even outdoes the one of Babes in Arms. Like many Broadway musicals it even features reprises of most of the movies' songs. Even more outrageous is the cheezy melodramatic spoof Nell of New Rochelle that the teens put together seemingly in hours. Strike Up the Band! is worth repeat viewings even if it isn't something one thinks how teenagers really were back in 1940.".

	schema:headline " Wonderful Judy Garland";
	schema:reviewBody "Judy Garland is absolutely lovely and amazing in this film as she is in most of her other films from the late 1930s all through the 1940s. Judy is beautiful has a heavenly singing voice and also knows how to be quirky funny andor passionate in her speaking parts too. Judy's songs  drummer boy and our love affair are wonderful in this film. And the scene with Judy singing it was just our lovely love affair at the house certainly was lovely. Same with Judy's cute little quirky reaction to Mickey missing her opening her heart to Mickey and saying you remind me of the song Oh what a pal was Mary. And Judy doing La conga is great and she helped open the doors for the Latin style music that was to come during the 1940s with musicians such as Xavier Couget who was in numerous films with the wonderful Esther Williams. Micky Rooney and the others such as June Priesser are great in this film too although Mickey gets a little too hammy in a couple of scenes like in Babes in arms when he gets so hyper excited when the studio director offered him 100. But that was all part of Mickey's comedy style. I liked June when she does her tumbling act to Ta ra ra boom der lay during the play sequence Nell of New Rochelle. Some people had written in reviews how they were able to possibly fit in the time for an entire play production and we never saw any scenes where they were rehearsing and they all had so much else going on in the film. These were all questions that were pointless to ask such as in Footlight parade why didn't we see any rehearsing for the swimming routine By a waterfall like actual swimming rehearsing? I say first of all that the films only show us so many minutes of every day of the film characters and we just need to use our imaginations for how the rest of the minutes get filled in. Secondly this film and Footlight parade were both Busby Berkely films where one of his specialties is taking the audience to a magical escapist fantasy land where we aren't supposed to question everyday logic. You can also ask why we never saw Judy rehearsing La Conga? My opinion is don't ask. Just enjoy the wonder. And it is wonderful. Judy's song I've got nobody and nobody got me tugs at the heartstrings sort of like I'm just an inbetween in Love finds Andy Hardy and But not for me in Girl crazy. You feel for her hurt feelings and know how she just doesn't deserve it and the sympathy is only intensified by knowing about the real hurt Judy Garland had in her life. She dealt with a lot of unfair pain and gave nothing back but love and wonderful music and films. I never have had such strong sympathy for anyone else before. I still wonder how the filmmakers conducted the special effects during the fruitchestra or the fruit paying orchestra. I noticed during the fair when Mickey misplaced his wallet and the way the tough seedy carny and his clown assistant grabbed him and threw him into the way of the balls flying just for innocently misplacing your wallet? I guess that carny had a pretty seedy background where he just didn't trust anybody and he was certain Mickey was pulling a fast one. All in all this film was very enjoyable and the wonderful Judy made it even better.".

She dealt with a lot of unfair pain and gave nothing back but love and wonderful music and films. I never have had such strong sympathy for anyone else before. I still wonder how the filmmakers conducted the special effects during the fruitchestra or the fruit paying orchestra. I noticed during the fair when Mickey misplaced his wallet and the way the tough seedy carny and his clown assistant grabbed him and threw him into the way of the balls flying just for innocently misplacing your wallet? I guess that carny had a pretty seedy background where he just didn't trust anybody and he was certain Mickey was pulling a fast one. All in all this film was very enjoyable and the wonderful Judy made it even better.";

If you love Hollywood musicals from the 1940 era this one is an absolute must have as well as a must see. Paul Whiteman is here with a nice contribution as he donates money to the youngsters to help them to put the band together. That was a nice touch and meant a lot to me.

But it is clear that Mary wants more she wishes she and Jimmey were boyfriend and girlfriend.

They are a big hit at their first dance but Jimmy has a bigger goal. Famous bandleader Paul Whiteman playing himself and his Orchestra are holding a contest to find the best high school dance band in the USA and Jimmy thinks his band can win. But they need to earn 200 to get a bus to take them to Chicago for the live radio broadcast where audience members will call in and vote. Sounds a lot like American Idol doesn't it? As in all these movies from this era family values are prominent and there is a lesson to be learned. Here Jimmy must come to grips with balancing his ambition with his promises to his friends and fellow band members when he is offered an immediate job as a drummer with a new band.Good movie and being a Busby Berkely movie several very elaborate song and dance production numbers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a huge lifelong fan of Judy Garland with a voice that you can listen to for hours and tire of and who likes her paired with Mickey Rooney a multitalented performer with a tendency to overdo it 'Strike Up the Band' was definitely something that couldn't be missed.To me 'Strike Up the Band' is the second best of their four backyard musicals. Their best being 'Girl Crazy' the best paced of the four and with the best songs and choreography even if the story is not as good as the rest of the film. Faring weakest is 'Babes on Broadway' 'Babes in Arms' was a slightly better film regardless of its bowdlerisation of the source material that film gets a lot right still but is too sentimental contrived and corny in places with some out of place patriotism and a sourtasteinthemouth finale. All four are worth watching though and all four are well above average films.'Strike Up the Band' is not perfect either its Achilles heel being the far too corny melodramatic and ponderous middle third a shame because the film is actually very well paced for most of it and then drags badly in the nonmusical moments of the middle third. The dialogue warms the heart and moves sometimes but the silly corniness of some of it is cringeworthy.Lastly while the cast are mostly splendid there is one exception and that is the terribly annoying June Preisser just as much as in 'Babes in Arms' enviously athletic dancing is not enough for an obnoxious character played far too broadly to unbearable degrees.However even when not in Technicolor 'Strike Up the Band' still looks lovely in crisp black and white and with elegant production design. As said on the musical front production values songs vocal performance arrangements choreography and dancing 'Strike Up the Band' fares significantly better. The songs are great not as great as the scores for 'Girl Crazy' and 'Babes in Arms' but almost. The three best songs being the plaintive Our Love Affair the exuberant Drummer Boy and the barnstorming Do the La Conga.Busby Berkeley's direction and how he stages the songs are not quite as imaginative witty or dazzling as some of his other films but it doesn't come over heavyhandedly and it has charm tenderness and energy particularly in the aforementioned three songs. Unlike 'Babes on Broadway' sentimentality is avoided thankfully and is replaced by a lot of entertainment and heartwarming. The story is unexceptional but is full of energy fun heart and charm palling only in the nonmusical moments of the middle third.Rooney and Garland make 'Strike Up the Band' especially worth seeing they are both on top form and their chemistry irresistible. From personal opinion of the four RooneyGarland backyard musicals despite 'Babes in Arms' being the one to get the Oscar nomination this contains Rooney's best performance of the four his role really plays to his strengths and even stretches him in showing more talents that one never knew he had i.e. didn't know he could play the drum so well. Garland is as ever radiant and deeply touching Our Love Affair being one of the most poignant renditions of any song in a film she starred in very near the top too and the list is long. Paul Whiteman not the King of Jazz for nothing contributes hugely to the film's appeal too.Overall a thoroughly enjoyable film a must for Garland fans and a must for anybody wanting to see what the fuss is about with her and Rooney together. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a high energy film about music talent success family imagination fun and teenagers growing up in a typical Midwestern town of the time. The year is 1940 and the world is on the brink of war. The recovery from the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl in America was in its infancy. The movie studios of Hollywood were in their heyday. MGM was leading in the battle to produce the best musicals and it had some hot talent in two young stars. Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland were 20 and 18yearold actors who had proved their talent. Rooney had been in movies since early childhood and had made a successful transition into older boy roles. He had made Boys Town The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and was a huge success in the Andy Hardy series. Garland's rising star was even more recent. She had some songs in a couple of small musicals and sang two numbers in the 1938 Andy Hardy film Love Finds Andy Hardy. Then she made the classic fantasy adventure musical The Wizard of Oz. To round out 1939 the two were paired as the leads of a comedy musical and they scored a smashing success in Babes in Arms. So MGM had all the proof it needed for future boxoffice success with this dynamic duo. Strike Up the Band had even more going for it than its two stars. Busby Berkeley had directed Babes in Arms and got the nod again. But in this film he inserted some of the extravaganza of music and dance that were his fort. And Arthur Freed brought his considerable resources in music story and sets as producer. The talent in Strike Up the Band isn't only in the music  the performances and numbers headed by Rooney and Garland or in Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. Rooney and company do a splendid job with a Gay Nineties spoof ala Vaudeville that had me laughing out loud a number of times. And a fantasy dream sequence with pieces of fruit as men playing instruments for a dream number show some creative talent in the Freed unit and MGM studio. It's the only example of clayanimation I can think of in early movies. Some 50 years later Will Vinton and others would make claymation much more popular in film and on TV. The chorus lines great choreography costumes and dance and show numbers staged by Berkeley round out this talent spectacular. Allinall this is an excellent film that showcases some of the rising stars of the time. It has a bigname band great imagination and wonderful musical numbers. And it's topped off with clever scenes lots of laughs and tons of energy. As for Rooney's high energy that some may find over the top at times  it was as much a part of the story and movie as all the other pieces that put together add up to a very good comedy musical. It's first rate entertainment. Oh yes  there are a few tender serious moments and those fit very nicely.".

She had some songs in a couple of small musicals and sang two numbers in the 1938 Andy Hardy film Love Finds Andy Hardy. Then she made the classic fantasy adventure musical The Wizard of Oz. To round out 1939 the two were paired as the leads of a comedy musical and they scored a smashing success in Babes in Arms. So MGM had all the proof it needed for future boxoffice success with this dynamic duo. Strike Up the Band had even more going for it than its two stars. Busby Berkeley had directed Babes in Arms and got the nod again. But in this film he inserted some of the extravaganza of music and dance that were his fort. And Arthur Freed brought his considerable resources in music story and sets as producer. The talent in Strike Up the Band isn't only in the music  the performances and numbers headed by Rooney and Garland or in Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. Rooney and company do a splendid job with a Gay Nineties spoof ala Vaudeville that had me laughing out loud a number of times. And a fantasy dream sequence with pieces of fruit as men playing instruments for a dream number show some creative talent in the Freed unit and MGM studio. It's the only example of clayanimation I can think of in early movies. Some 50 years later Will Vinton and others would make claymation much more popular in film and on TV. The chorus lines great choreography costumes and dance and show numbers staged by Berkeley round out this talent spectacular. Allinall this is an excellent film that showcases some of the rising stars of the time. It has a bigname band great imagination and wonderful musical numbers. And it's topped off with clever scenes lots of laughs and tons of energy. As for Rooney's high energy that some may find over the top at times  it was as much a part of the story and movie as all the other pieces that put together add up to a very good comedy musical. It's first rate entertainment. Oh yes  there are a few tender serious moments and those fit very nicely.";

I do love the great Technicolor musical film extravaganzas but this was not to be had here.Mickey and Judy were childhood entertainers. They are leads in this film. Everyone else looks like they have been thrown under the bus in today's parlance. They are so much wallpaper. Mickey and Judy were not the handsomest prettiest or cutest but somehow they made it to the top. They could sing and dance but so could a lot of people. I keep harping on the casting couch. Just consider it.I like the villain vaudeville section but I think that the latter part of the conga extravaganza is way too long. The long and drawn out dance group scene is tiring to look at. Of course the parts where Mickey and Judy double dance together are quite excellent. Busby Berkeley did something right here.I think that the fruit and nut orchestra has stolen the picture. They are so cute. The black tuxedos that they wear are just adorable. Some of the orchestra members are walnuts are they playing pieces of chocolate and white layer cake shaped like grand pianos? Hmmmm it dazzles the senses.Look for Joe Yule Sr. selling tickets at the fair. A quick eye will catch him. He was the real life father of Mickey Rooney.Finally don't say that the U.S. thought a world war would happen soon. It already was happening. Herr Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. The U.S. joined the war. It happened after this film was released. It WAS the Great Depression but the U.S. economy was growing due to manufacture and sales of war materiels to the European war effort in the later 1930s. World War Two ended the Great Depression.Mickey Rooney would join that war and his later career would suffer because of his absence.Films like this one soon would be helping a warweary America find some kind of happiness in a growing dark and dreary time period. 1941 was war time for the U.S. not ending until 1945.You know that song and dance films are my utmost favorite but I despise black and white  ugh!!

The film won an Academy Award for its Sound Recording and its Original Song Our Love Affair by George Stoll and Roger Edens was Oscar nominated as was their Score. George Pal uncredited animated a fruit orchestra sequence for the song. John Monks Jr. and Fred Finklehoffe wrote the screenplay the George and Ira Gershwin title song is used in the musical finale.James 'Jimmy' Connors Rooney is a high school drummer that's bored with playing the same old songs like the national anthem so he organizes late night jazz jam sessions with his friends. His girlfriend Mary Holden Garland is a talented singer that's frustrated because Jimmy treats her like a pal instead of a gal. Jimmy's widow mother Ann Shoemaker has always wanted him to go to college to become a doctor like his father but his real passion is his music. Encouraged by Mary he decides to ask their school principal Mr. Judd Francis Pierlot if he can organize a dance band. Because Mr. Judd had been thinking of disbanding the school's orchestra because of mounting debts he agrees and enthusiastically proclaims that he'll buy the first ticket e.g. to the dance. The school function is a big success and soon Jimmy has an even bigger idea to enter conductor Paul Whiteman's radio contest for high school bands which is offering a top prize of 500 to the winner. Unfortunately romantic entanglements distract Jimmy from this goal.June Preisser plays Barbara Frances Morgan a worldly new rich girl at school who decides that Jimmy is just the boy for her. He seems helplessly unable to resist her charms and temporarily lets down his Mary his best friend Philip Turner William Tracy and the other band members. Larry Nunn plays 13 year old Willie Brewster who has a crush on Mary and tries to comfort her in Jimmy's absence. Margaret Early plays Phil's girlfriend Annie. But Jimmy gets it together and with Mary's and Phil's help he and his Riverwood High School pals produce and act in a musical play for the local Elks Club raising 150 towards the 200 they need to get to Chicago for Whiteman's contest. Barbara then steals Jimmy away from the cast party with his friends by telling him that she can convince her father to hire their band for her eighteenth birthday party. However when Mr. Morgan George Lessey says that he'd already made other arrangements Jimmy is upset until he learns that Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra has been hired and he and his friends are all invited.At Barbara's party Jimmy and his band can't resist taking the stage and playing a number of their own during the hired band's break they impress the bandleader so much that Whiteman offers Jimmy a job in New York. But Jimmy's mother who'd earlier released her son from her dream of him becoming a doctor when she'd realized his sincere passion for his music reminds him that disappointing his friends was no way to start his new career. So Jimmy tells Whiteman his decision but then secures the remaining 50 as a loan using his drum set for collateral.However Willie who'd hurt his arm during the Elks Club show and neglected to take care of it is now in need of a doctor the situation is so serious that the doctor Howard Hickman states that unless the boy sees a specialist in Chicago right away his life is in danger. Jimmy doesn't hesitate to give the band's 200 in order to charter a plane for Willie's transportation. When Mr. Morgan reads about it he asks Jimmy to meet him for breakfast he's made arrangements for a Chicago bound train to transport Jimmy and his band to Chicago to participate in Whiteman's contest which utilizes a local audience as well as American Idollike telephone voting to select its winner. After the obvious outcome the titled finale is performed.".

	schema:reviewBody "SON OF THE RED CORSAIR the English language title of this film was made in 1958 but not shown in the US until 1963 so this film predates Lex Barker's ascension into German stardom via the Dr. Mabuse films and eventually the series of westerns based on Karl May novels. During the 5861 period he made a number of costume historical dramas in Italy most of which are worth watching if you can find them. This exciting entry casts Barker as a Spanish count who is the son of the Red Corsair a legendary pirate. He is simultaneously avenging his father's death looking for his longlost sister romancing a lovely Marquise and fighting off various enemies. You name it this film has itswordfights romance mystery music and dance comedy sequences etc. It all works well and moves quicklyand the film packs a lot into 80 minutes. Barker is tough yet charming elegant yet earthy. And he manages to keep a straight face while wearing various powdered wigs andor ponytails! The dubbing is acceptable by the standards of the day. Director Primo Zeglio directed many costume historical dramas in the 50s and early 60sincluding Morgan the Pirate with Steve Reeves and Seven Seas to Calais with Rod Taylor as Sir Francis Drake a film often shown on TCM in the USA. In the mid60s he directed four westerns two under psuedonyms including the excellent Cursed Valley with Ty Hardin. He also directed the cult favorite scifi Perry Rhodan epic MISSION STARDUST starring Lang Jeffries which if you think about it is just another kind of costume historical drama in a different timesetting!. Unfortunately the SWV video of SON OF THE RED CORSAIR the film reviewed here is a panandscan black and white TV print of a film shot and released in color and widescreen. The film will surely be an awesome experience on DVD someday... Until then even this bw version is entertaining enough to be worth your finding a copy if you are a Barker fan or a fan of Italian swashbucklers of the era. They don't make them like this anymore and there will never be another Lex Barker.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first have to say that i'm not a professional critic. It is very hard for me to find the right words to describe any form of art.43 is my age and maybe i have seen many movies in my life. The movies i saw the day before 'R' were 'The good the bad the weird' and 'I saw the devil'. The first was very good fun and the latter from the same director gave me a feeling of I don't want to witness this. I'm getting to old for this kind of excitement.So with that feeling in mind I red the summary of 'R'. I had also seen 'un prophete' great movie btw. Comparisons here. Masterpiece there. etc etc. I had to see it.The feeling of not want to witness this stayed until the opening scenes with the shady music and Rune going up the stairs. And stayed with me until the end. After seeing this movie a week ago I still want to cry. I now realise that the director bathed me 99 minutes in powerlessness. This movie literally gave me besides a sadness that stretches and stretches a genuine fear for the prison system in my own socially secured country.Musically this is a movie that won't disappear in the shadows of more stylistic films like 'The deer hunter' 'Once upon a time in the west' and more recently 'There will be blood'. All with their masterpiece defining music scores. In the prison the camera captures the non existing distance of stares of guards inmates grandmothers Rashid and Rune. And what this did to me emotionally was something i never experienced so profound before. A movie that makes your heart cry is one thing but to go beyond that and mix the acting with this kind of realism is very special.The last fifteen minutes with Rashid played with my sympathy for the main character and was a big switch but made also clear that the story doesn't stop. And with that last zoom out the fridge door closes again. Can you compare Radiohead with The Beatles. 'R' is in my opinion emotionally in a league of it's own. But keep in mind my age. Maybe i'm just approaching a midlife crisis where crying gets easier and tears just trouble my judgement.".

In fact it was the first movie where during the Q and A with the director nobody left the space. The reason i don't want to compare both movies is also that because i saw them on the same day. After this stunning violent rollercoaster watching the long une prophete is not easy and won't be honoust towards une prophete.. But nevertheless this film took me fully with amateurs and old inmates in roles it is breathtaking raw dark and intense. Nothing is too much nothing is too long nothing is to thin its a fantastic movie who deserves a big audience. For those who are interested in the rates i gave to Une Prophete it's an 8 but i still want to see both movies again but not on the same day anymore. What a ride it was and thank you for producing this masterpiece which is in my all time top 10 whatever other people think of it".

This Danish entry is codirected by Tobias Lindholm and Michael Noer. The strength of the film lies in the ensemble playing the directors got from the strong cast they amassed. It is not a film for those weak at heart prison life being what it is it shows in vivid detail what goes on behind bars when criminals must survive one way or another.Johan Philip Asbaek who plays Rune makes a great impression in the way he approaches the role. Dulfil AlJabouri is seen as Rashid the only friend Rune finds in that milieu. The supporting cast is excellent mainly Omar Shargawi and Roland Moller.

	schema:headline " A Danish version of Un Prophete that isn't as good.";
	schema:reviewBody "aw this film at it's press screening this morning at Edinburgh International Film Festival. I'd heard it was meant to be the next 'Un Prophete'. Certainly if you haven't seen 'Un Prophete' you may well think this film is brilliant. Those that have seen 'Un Prophete' however may go away a little bit disappointed. There is just too much that is the same in both films. Both the films explore the tough inner workings of a prison from the point of view of a new comer. We are not told why this main character is in prison only that he maybe stabbed somebody. He seems to be a good guy who is trapped working for a gang in prison. He's made to do tasks he doesn't want to do so he isn't treated like dirt or killed. there is also another gang in the prison made up of Albanians etcetc.etc.It's the same old prison story that's getting told over and over. It is however a solid story so it's what they do with it that matters.They succeed in creating a likable main character that we sympathise with and support. They show how gritty and corrupt a Danish prison is. They do the whole thing with sexy camera angle's and expert editing.I was enjoying the movie until I began to feel it wasn't going anywhere then near the end we switch character perspective and follow a different character for the last fifteen minutes. For me the story ends with our main character I'm not interested in seeing his friend story for another 15minutes that just didn't work for me. I saw others shifting uncomfortably in the audience as well. When the second end does come though it does hit with impact. I found myself wanting to look away as it was fairly intense.The film is on some levels very good the soundtrack is perfect well there's no songs just an intense score. The acting is amazing the set is great editing brilliant script pretty flawless. It's the story that just didn't grab me like it should've. There was nothing I hadn't seen before. It was a classic prison movie done better than most but not as good as 'Un Prophete' and 'Shawshank'. I was blown away by some shots in the film which were just incredible.'Un Prophete' for me is the best prison movie it has everything it is long but justifiably. R is shorter at 90 minutes but it was the end that spoiled it for me. If R had come out before 'Un Prophete' I'd probably like it better but R doesn't explore much that 'Un Prophete' doesn't. I just wasn't interested in the last 1520minutes. It's a shame a lot of work has obviously gone into the film. It is still worth seeing. However I'd recommend most people just stick with 'Un Prophete'.www.duncansreviews.wordpress.com www.duncancowles.com".

	onyx:emotionText "aw this film at it's press screening this morning at Edinburgh International Film Festival. I'd heard it was meant to be the next 'Un Prophete'. Certainly if you haven't seen 'Un Prophete' you may well think this film is brilliant. Those that have seen 'Un Prophete' however may go away a little bit disappointed. There is just too much that is the same in both films. Both the films explore the tough inner workings of a prison from the point of view of a new comer. We are not told why this main character is in prison only that he maybe stabbed somebody. He seems to be a good guy who is trapped working for a gang in prison. He's made to do tasks he doesn't want to do so he isn't treated like dirt or killed. there is also another gang in the prison made up of Albanians etcetc.etc.It's the same old prison story that's getting told over and over. It is however a solid story so it's what they do with it that matters.They succeed in creating a likable main character that we sympathise with and support. They show how gritty and corrupt a Danish prison is. They do the whole thing with sexy camera angle's and expert editing.I was enjoying the movie until I began to feel it wasn't going anywhere then near the end we switch character perspective and follow a different character for the last fifteen minutes. For me the story ends with our main character I'm not interested in seeing his friend story for another 15minutes that just didn't work for me. I saw others shifting uncomfortably in the audience as well. When the second end does come though it does hit with impact. I found myself wanting to look away as it was fairly intense.The film is on some levels very good the soundtrack is perfect well there's no songs just an intense score. The acting is amazing the set is great editing brilliant script pretty flawless. It's the story that just didn't grab me like it should've. There was nothing I hadn't seen before. It was a classic prison movie done better than most but not as good as 'Un Prophete' and 'Shawshank'. I was blown away by some shots in the film which were just incredible.'Un Prophete' for me is the best prison movie it has everything it is long but justifiably.

However although the actingactors were first rate and the photography good if sombre as it should have been the story was trite. I haven't see Le Prophete to which it is compared but I have seen Shawshank. I cannot understand the comparison with Shawshank a much better movie not really on the same subject except superficially. It was gritty nasty illustrating well how low people can sink. So? As a movie supposedly about life in prison it was disjointed bitty disconnected. The general story line was clear drug dealing in prison but the relationships the deals and the dealing were poorly dealt with. As was said in the previous reviews the last 20mins was hard to take being so far from the rest of the movie.For a production team with such a good filmography this is out of line.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the great things about movies is that every once in awhile the unexpected happens something comes along that you know immediately is just a bit different and special somehow.  Usually it's the film itself but on occasion and this is one of them a character will emerge who is not just a character in a movie but IS the movie.  Here it's the title character of Crocodile Dundee' directed by Peter Faiman and starring Paul Hogan as the inimitable Mick Dundee a rather unique individual hailing from the small hamlet of Walkabout Creek Australia.  Mick hit the big screen in 1986 and from the first moment he appeared right up through the end of the second sequel it's been a G'day' for audiences around the world.In Australia on assignment for her New York newspaper journalist Sue Charlton Linda Kozlowski runs across a story she just has to pursue.  It's about a legendary local' from one of the small towns on the cusp of the bush a crocodile hunter who the story goes had his leg bitten off by a croc then managed to survive by crawling alone for days on end across the outback.  So it's off to the town of Walkabout Creek in search of this largerthanlife character who it turns out is quite a character' to say the least.  He is in fact one of a kind.  After a memorable meeting in the town's only pub one of about four buildings in the whole place Michael J. Mick' Dundee agrees to take her on a tour retracing his steps and reconstructing the famous event where it actually took place.  He promises a hard journey through some rugged terrain no place in fact for a Sheila' but like any good reporter she's ready for anything or so she thinks.  And it's the beginning of an adventure she as well as the audience will never forget.Hogan concocted the story and created the character then wrote the screenplay along with John Cornell and Ken Shadie after which he turned it over to director Faiman who did a worthy if not exceptional job of translating Hogan's vision to the screen.  Faiman however is destined to be the forgotten man with regards to this project inasmuch as he was not only necessarily overshadowed by writerstar Hogan but he presented the film in a fairly straightforward manner without anything particularly noteworthy that he' did that would put his signature' on it.  Add to that the fact that this was the first of only two films Faiman ever directed his second was the lackluster Dutch' in 1991 simply not enough to reference him nothing added to his resume afterwards to make you take notice and say Oh yes he directed Dundee' too.'  Still filmmaking is inherently a collaborative medium and as they say a film does not direct' itself so credit must be given where it is due and considering how good this film is and how well it did at the box office it points up that whatever Faiman did he did right.  And he deserves to be acknowledged for it.It's no secret of course what really makes this film work.  Aside from the engaging story with it's romantic notions of adventure from beginning to end it has the four Big Cs' going for it  Character Charisma Chemistry and Charm.  Let's face it Paul Hogan is The Man' as Mick Dundee he's the guy other guys admire and want to be whether or not they'll admit to it and he has the kind of natural good looks charisma and charm that is irresistible to the ladies whether or not they'll admit to it.  And the chemistry between Hogan and Kozlowski is irrefutable it's the kind that makes you want to put another shrimp on the barbie.  Besides all of which there is an innate honesty about Hogan's Mick that shines through like a 1st order Fresnel light in a London fog.  He's laidback and grounded with a refreshingly logical outlook on life this guy's never going to need a pill for hypertension and what adds even more to his appeal is that there's a touch of larceny in his makeup hiding just beneath that twinkle in his eye and his obvious integrity.  You also know instinctively that this is the guy you want in your corner when the chips are down.  All of this and more is what Paul Hogan captures in his performance this is the Mick Crocodile' Dundee he brings to the screen.In her motion picture debut the lovely Linda Kozlowski brings some sizzle to the screen and proves to be the perfect counterpoint to costar Hogan. Something of an Ibsenesque' role model she demonstrates that a woman can be strong and ultra feminine capable yet vulnerable and all at the same time.  It makes her portrayal of Sue Charlton convincing well rounded and real much more than just a cardboard cutout kind of a character that could have been used as nothing more than a vehicle to move the story along. Instead though this is without question Mick Dundee's story she makes it her story too and it gives the film an added perspective and considerably more depth than what is usually found in light comedy which is essentially what this film is.  And there's a look in her eye and something in the way she smiles at Mick that has an absolute ring of truth to it.  You could say in fact that Hogan and Kozlowski are the Bogie and Bacall of the outback.Another invaluable asset to the film is the performance of the likable John Meillon as Mick's friend Walter Reilly.  The part is a true character actor's character and Meillon does it beautifully.  The supporting cast includes Mark Blum Richard Michael Lombard Sam Steve Rackman Donk and Reginald VelJohnson Gus.  A memorable film filled with unforgettable characters Crocodile Dundee' will take you to the top o'the world... down under.'  1010.".

In terms of plot its simpler than simple  American reporter Linda Kozlowski is sent to Australia to investigate the legendary 'Crocodile' Dundee Hogan and ends up bringing the charming rogue back to the Big Apple.  It's a winner in every sense from Hogan's wonderfully laidback performance to his own screenplay featuring an array of classic quips and moments.

	schema:reviewBody "What a wonderful adventure romance! This is a film that neither my husband my teenage son or myself can resist watching time after time whenever it happens to be on TV.The movie tells the tale of Mick Dundee a charismatic adventurer from Walkabout Creek in the Australian outback who ends up as a 'croc out of water' as some reviewers have cleverly phrased it in New York City. Naturally there's a 'sheila' with him a love interest in the form of beautiful blonde American journalist Sue Charlton. The sparks fly between them the chemistry cooks and so on.This movie of course is made solely by the legendary character of Mick Dundee played to charming perfection by Paul Hogan both in his native bush and also Big City settings. You'll be in stitches you'll cheer for him you'll be amazed at his adaptation of his unique Down Under bush survival skills to the streets of the Big Apple. The knife incident...what can I say? He displays an endearing innocence of the seedier aspects of Big City life notably its drugs and prostitutes. But it's not only Mick's humour and charisma this adventurer is a guy with integrity that would put most everyone rural or urban Australian or American to shame. The greatest supporting role here must surely go to Mick's bush buddy Wally who's basically 'all talk and no action' yet one of the most likable ever film characters.The ending? I won't give it away but it's a dilly a dandy and a doozy. Just one of the many reasons I can watch this great movie again and again. The first Crocodile Dundee sequel is equally entertaining and though the second Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles doesn't quite measure up I can never resist watching Mick in action.".

	schema:headline " The First Great Australian Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "The Australian film industry first began to come to international notice in the seventies and early eighties with films like Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock and Gallipoli Fred Schepisi's The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith and Bruce Beresford's Breaker Morant. Most of these were films with a serious theme and often a historical setting. Crocodile Dundee was different. Not only did it have a contemporary setting it was also perhaps the first great Australian comedy certainly the first Australian comedy to achieve international success.The protagonists are Mick Dundee a bushman from northern Australia and Sue Charleton an attractive young female journalist from New York. Sue is on assignment in Australia and hears stories about a legendary crocodile hunter from the small outback village of Walkabout Creek. The name may be homage to Nicolas Roeg's film Walkabout one of the earliest manifestations of the Australian New Wave. One of the stars of that film David Gumpilil has a part in Crocodile Dundee. Sue meets Mick to interview him and travels with him into the bush to see the scene of his famed encounter with a crocodile that nearly cost him his leg. She then arranges for him to travel back to New York with her the first time he has been outside Australia or visited a city.The film is essentially a romantic comedy. Romantic comedies generally deal with a couple in love and the way in which they overcome obstacles to their love. A common type of obstacle is a discrepancy in their social backgrounds and this is the type we have here. Sue and Mick seem to be polar opposites. She is a typical product of the American East Coast elite urban wealthy professional politically committed to liberal causes. He is from a workingclass background rural apolitical with no fixed employment. As another reviewer has pointed out he is as much a fish out of water in the city as she is in the outback. To make things worse he is considerably older than her and she already has a boyfriend her editor Richard. There is however a saying that polar opposites attract and this is as true of characters in romantic comedies as it is of magnets. The marvellous ending on the crowded subway station is one of the most memorable finales to any romantic comedy rivalling that of The Graduate. Some romantic comedies concentrate on romance at the expense of comedy but Crocodile Dundee is not one of them. The film is brilliantly funny especially in the second half when the action moves to New York. The main source of the humour is Paul Hogan's title character. Mick is a rough diamond but decent kindly and goodhearted. Most of the laughs arise from his innocent misunderstanding of the seedier aspects of life in the big city there are jokes at the expense of prostitutes criminals like the muggers who flee when they see Mick has a bigger knife than they have That's not a knife. THAT'S a knife! transvestites one of whom Mick mistakenly tries to chat up drug takers Mick thinks cocaine is a cure for blocked sinuses and psychiatrists Haven't you got any mates to talk to? This last sentiment touched a chord in Britain ever suspicious of the American obsession with psychoanalysis. Mick may be apolitical but he is also politically incorrect much of the humour is aimed at the culture of political correctness just starting to burgeon in the mideighties. There are jokes about race and gender and Dundee is not only a drinker but also a heavy smoker. And this during a decade when smoking was almost banished from the screen.Some of the humour is perhaps a bit exaggerated it is for example difficult to believe that Mick does not recognise the prostitutes for what they are as he is no sexual innocent but a redblooded ladies' man with an eye for the Sheilas but this is deliberate exaggeration for satirical effect. The film both satirises and celebrates Australia's selfimage as a land of selfreliant pioneers from the outback most modern Australians in fact live in the suburbs of a few large cities by contrasting idealised rural Australian values with the supposed vices of urban America.Despite the great success of this film the sequel was less successful and Paul Hogan and his lovely costar Linda Kozlowski who later became his wife did not perhaps go on to the glittering careers that some had predicted for them. Nevertheless Mick Dundee will live on as one of the great comic characters of all time and the film itself as one of the best comedies of the eighties and possibly the best Australian comedy ever. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Crocodile Dundee  45 starsA Film Review by John UlmerCrocodile Dundee is one of those Fish Out of the Water tales the innocent outsider thrown into the frustrations of modern life. Or is it the Croc out of the Water? Whatever it is it's one of the best of its genre.Crocodile Dundee is about a newspaper journalist Linda Kozlowski who travels out to the Outback where she meets with Mick Dundee better known as Crocodile Dundee. After wandering around in the Outback for a few days with Mick writing her little story about surviving in the Outback she decides that it would be interesting for her or her newspaper? to bring Mick back to New York City where she lives. Mick reluctantly agrees and travels to New York City clad in his crocskin vest and Australian hat. Now Mick will have to adjust to modern life if he wishes to survive in New York.Crocodile Dundee is in a way very typical of its kind. For example Mick walks off the plane to NYC and steps onto an escalator dressed in his Australian attire. Now no matter how innocent and inexperienced a guy is you can't tell me he's not going to realize he looks a bit odd in his clothes. The first thing I'd do is try to change to fit in better. But you see this is half the fun of this films and all Fish Out of the Water films for that matter. If the main character did adapt straight away to his new surroundings not only would it make for an awfully boring tale but it would not be a proper Fish Out of the Water film.Not only is Paul Hogan completely convincing in his role as Mick Dundee he is utterly likable from the start. He's a nice innocent Outback man who learns what the fast life is like yet sticks to his old ways. As we can see from the lesssuccessful sequels Mick never really adapts to his surroundings. He learns how to survive but he never buys fancy clothes or such he sticks with his crocvest and hat. While Crocodile Dundee isn't exactly a great comedy it's one of those that can be remembered for being very funny and it is easy to watch. It has a certain charm to it like many of those eighties' comedies. It makes it hard to hate them. Just yesterday I wrote a review for Opportunity Knocks with Dana Carvey. That movie wasn't great but it's hard to dislike it. While Crocodile Dundee is about ten times greater than Opportunity Knocks it still isn't an excellent comedy. But because of its likable charm and great sense of humor it's definitely one to see and watch many many times.There have been a lot of these kinds of films Blast From the Past Bubble Boy to name a few recent of the genre. But Crocodile Dundee ranks as one of the best of its kind.45 stars John Ulmer".

The film does come dangerously close to falling into a sugary romcom mire but with a strong performance from Linda Kozlowski as Sue and Hogan introducing an icon to 80s cinema Crocodile Dundee safely hits the target that it was surely aiming for. Besides the love story here is very easy to get on side with.Two sequels would follow the first one was a retread reversal and just about passable the second one after a gap of 13 years was bad and evidence that the joke had long since passed.

This won Golden globe awards for both Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski. it was also awarded a Golden Screen Award. On top of that was nominated for an 'Oscar'. It did also win for best music scoring Peter Best. Peter Best don't tell me this was the Beatle's first drummer? That Best??? I saw this when I was 18 and I remember being amazed at the complexity and yet simplistic view played out by Paul's character. Wow! I thought this was really like a Raiders of the Lost Ark  in a different way. Similar in newness a great story event. Something that made you think and feel just a little more than others stories. When films were just getting exciting. To me this was shot intensely well with talented direction and careful attention to the details especially the character development. It was new and very exciting to see and feel what all was brought to the screen in Dolby sound. I realize that some people won't follow what I am saying completely but as I have learned over the years not all cinema is equal. I especially love it when He said Jesus Christ and all of them apostles were fishermen if him and me were working here together we'd be mates.This has the ability I believe to touch the heart in an awesome underdog kind of way. My heart was in my throat at the subway scene and I was rooting for Dundee! I recommend this to buy and watch again when you feel like seeing it and noticing how you can get something different out of it each time you see this. Smart original comedy with the beautiful 'Outback as scenery and even a great chick flick on a dinner and movie date night. ".

Thatcher was in 10 Downing Street Reagan in The White House 'Dallas' and 'Miami Vice' were the biggest programmes on television and the film everyone was talking about was Paul Faiman's 'Crocodile Dundee'. At my local Odeon the queue stretched right round the block. Nothing like it had been seen since 'Grease'  1978 . Its starwritercreator was Paul Hogan who came to the attention of British television viewers when his Australian sketch show was bought by the fledgling Channel 4 network. On top of that his Fosters lager adverts proved popular particularly the one where he attends a ballet and does a doubletake when a Nureyevlike dancer twirls onto the stage Strewth! Bloke's got no strides on!.As was the case with 'Monty Python  The Holy Grail' backing for 'Dundee' came from various sources but the investments paid off. It was the second biggest moneymaker in the U.S. that year  the first being the awful 'Top Gun'  beating out 'Platoon' 'Star Trek 4 The Voyage Home' and 'Aliens'.So what was it all about? Divorced journalist Sue Charlton  Linda Koslowski  travels to Australia to meet the survivor of a crocodile attack. In the outback she finds eccentric crocodile poacher Michael J. Crocodile Dundee  Hogan . After spending some time with him and being impressed by his personality she takes him back to New York. The first forty minutes are good fun but when it moves to the Big Apple the film really gets into its comedic stride as Mick struggles to come to terms with American culture. He washes his socks in the hotel bath chats to a stranger in the street as though he is an old friend and when a mugger tries to rob him at knife point whips out his blade and grins That's a knife! causing the terrified man to flee.Suddenly a new folk hero was born. America had 'Superman' Britain had 'James Bond' and Australia now had 'Crocodile Dundee'. Hogan was ruggedly goodlooking and quickwitted. Audiences the world over were charmed by his laidback manner. Unfortunately they never accepted the actor in any other role.He attributed the picture's success to the love story at its heart. I think Linda Koslowski has not had enough credit for her contribution to the film not only is she sexy but intelligent and funny  and looks great in a thong! . The romance spilt over into real life for the stars.One person who could not have been pleased with the film's success was Barry Humphries whose 1971 comedy 'The Adventures Of Barry McKenzie'  starring Barry Crocker  also concerned an Australian man let loose in a foreign country. The films are very different. 'Dundee' is heart warming and its characters warm and likable 'McKenzie' on the other hand is raucous  lots of vomiting and urinating  and rude. I like both films for different reasons.Oscar nominated for Best Screenplay Hogan attended the 1987 ceremony in his 'Dundee' clothes. Two years later a sequel came out  'Crocodile Dundee 2'. It did not do the big business of the first  I thought personally it was superior  but proved popular all the same. Alas Hogan waited until 2001 to make a third picture  'Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles'. Audiences yawned.Twentyfive years later the original film stands the test of time as a delightful crowdpleasing comedy.".

'Crocodile' Dundee resident of Walkabout Creek in Australia's Northern Territory a man who lives off the land prefers isolation and solitude to crowds and has never been to a city in his life. Linda Kozlowski plays Sue Charlton a reporter from New Yoik writing a story about his exploits. When she decides to pay him a visit in The Outback she discovers a man so different to any other person she has met before she can't help but be captivated. She manages to persuade him to return with her to New Yoik whereupon the classic 'fish out of water' comedy shenanigans ensues before eventually their love wins over out all. It's trite true enough but Hogan is so damn likable in the lead role nothing else really matters. In truth this is a film where nothing really happens the focus instead being on the lead man and his interaction with all that is around him be it the familiar when on his home ground or the utterly alien when in NYC. Kozlowski is a great sidekick too and their genuine chemistry illuminates the screen a chemistry so potent that they ended up marrying in real life. Comedies are not normally my thing but this is so unrelentingly charming and crucially actually funny that it's hard not to find it endearing. The score must have a special mention too a haunting didgeridoo drone that really raises the hairs on the back of the neck. Warm witty and a genuine classic this is way better than its reputation may have you believe.".

Quite probably this is a result of political advertisements that convince that intelligence is somehow a reason for mistrust. It is not new I know but the widespread acceptance of it is true. The dumber the better. Before that we have movies with less severity where the hero was just plain naive. He would be an intelligent honest even brave man but out of his element. There would be some jokes about this but his good nature would see him through. These films go all way back. This one came along after a drought of a few years it seems so seemed new. Our guy is established as a rough and tumble fellow. He might be engaged in illegal work or perhaps he is chasing off poachers. The choice is ours but we know that he was adopted by the blacks and has some of their magic. He comes to the big city. The movie revolves around him winning the hearts of the New Yorkers and getting the girl. The fold here is mildly interesting the girl is a reporter writing a story about him and she basically falls in love with the story. But watching this now makes me embarrassed for a whole decade. This was actually nominated for an Oscar. The public liked it and screenwriters in the Academy thought the screen writing was so good it deserved recognition.It has two appealing set pieces. One sold the movie in the trailers. It is the deal where he is accosted by some street thugs who pull a knife. He pulls a bigger one and they run away. The other clever writing is the zinger at the end where New York working men relay messages of love across a crowded subway station. On her affirmation he literally walks on top of them to get to her while the crowd representing us as audience cheers. Four seconds of embrace with rising music and the end. But in between is some tired repellent stuff even the joke about confusion over plumbing appliances. I think the girl here was writeractor Hogan's real girlfriend. There is no other way such an unappealing actress would have been selected. She is ghastly.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

The film does come dangerously close to falling into a sugary romcom mire but with a strong performance from Linda Kozlowski as Sue and Hogan introducing an icon to 80s cinema Crocodile Dundee safely hits the target that it was surely aiming for. Besides the love story here is very easy to get on side with.The film quite naturally divides into two parts. The first in Australia has a surprising depth to it and a real feel for the placethe Outbackand its people and of course you get to know the characters. The second part of the film is set in New York and provides the bulk of the humour but still remains character focused and never descends into pointless gagmaking. It manages to be hilariously funny one moment and sweetly touching the next. Put simply the film is a delight and a joy to watch and can be seen many times without tiring of it.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

This leads her to the outback of Australia where she not only meets him facetoface but also has the opportunity to get several photos of where the event occurred. It's at this time that she gets the idea of having him come to New York City to finish the story from another angle. What she doesn't count on is just how much he is out of his element in the big city and the adventures he soon gets himself into. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it I will just say that this was a delightful comedy which kept my attention from the beginning to the very end. I especially liked the interaction between the two main characters who clearly enjoyed working together. In any case I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it for those who are looking for a movie of this type. I have rated it according.".

I however enjoyed it for the same reasons as the rest of America. It portrays a simple guy with a healthy attitude towards life in general. His romantic interest is a likeable woman who despite her family's wealth and her obvious good taste in clothes is also downtoearth and sincere. I think another reason people liked it was because Dundee's character isn't some oversized steroid filled fake that carries an uzi and blows away anything he doesn't like. He has no bad attitude he just takes what life gives him and makes the best of it. A lesson that we should all take to heart but a lesson that the movie manages to get across without being the least bit preachy.

	schema:headline " Mick Dundee or the downtoearth guy from Down Under ..";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm always all right when I'm with you Dundee. God that sounds corny after a pause Why do you make me feel like Jane in a Tarzan comic? This is Sue Charlton Linda Kozlowski relieved when Mick Dundee Paul Hogan got rid of three thugs after showing them what a real knife is. The line stops being corny when she admits it and unveils a subtle intelligence within the story as if by comparing the hero to a movie icon it makes him ordinary within the film while indirectly establishing his extraordinary status as a movie character. I read that Crocodile Dundee was a surprise hit at the time of its release being the second highestgrossing film of 1986 after Top Gun. Actually I'm more surprised that critics were surprised because Crocodile Dundee is precisely the kind of creations that made the 80's such a great decade on the field of fun sheer escapism and movie heroes. And Dundee is as cool brave macho and badass as Indiana Jones Conan or Rambo but for a change he doesn't kill people and he's far more sympathetic and likable than any of them. I say 'likable' because there must be a reason why a film with no stars and made by an unknown director would meet such a big success. Apart from word of mouth I can't figure.Although the word is hackneyed the crocodile hunter is as iconic as Indiana Jones himself immediately recognizable from his black hat with gator teeth his vest his brown leather jacket his Aussie accent and a hidden scratch in his leg he cutely calls a 'love bite'. The 'love bite' has been exaggerated into a bittenoff leg on its way to New York but it decided Sue Charlton to go to Australia and interview the mysterious legend a legend even more embellished by Mick's friend Walter. In a pub Dundee makes a spectacular entrance and reveals beneath his toughness a very downtoearth personality and an irresistible sense of humor. Creating an unforgettable character is not an easy task yet Crocodile Dundee does and that's a credit to Paul Hogan's fine performance rightfully earning him the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Comedy.Linda Kozlowski was also nominated as she plays her part perfectly. She's the audience that is invited to discover Mick's world with the nosiness and curiosity we expect from a female journalist that's Dundee talking. And the exchanges between Mick and Sue reveal a subtler writing than in any other comedy or romance when she mentions that the Aborigines own the land you could tell it's an overly reverent statement but Mick corrects her immediately arguing over who owns them is like two fleas arguing over who owns the dog they live on. no room from predictable lines Mick's age? The last time he asked when he was born the Aborigine who raised him said in summertime. When Walter informs them he'll be back in Wednesday Mick nods but after a pause has to ask what today is. As Walter comments Doesn't know. Doesn't care.And during the twonight trip Sue the 'sheila' discovers this world where the notion of time and property cease to exist. Whatever 'sheila' means woman or foreigner she's clearly an outsider and the script tactfully avoids the clich of the feminist urban female Kowzlowki plays her character very naturally she doesn't get offended by Dundee's macho comments she knows where her place is and she doesn't even save Mick or flirt with danger to prove something. This is crucial because it also helps to create a natural bonding process with a realism that is almost equal to Meryl Streep and Robert Redford in Out of Africa. And the film uses humor as the perfect language to highlight the growing complicity. For example he cooks her some snakes and disgusting animals she tries to eat them while he casually opens a cornedbeef can. Humor is not just granted because it's a comedy it's a real side of Mick's personality and his most endearing charm. And it is pivotal for the plot because it leads to what everybody expects the invitation. This is when Crocodile Dundee works like the missing link between Harrison Ford in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Eddie Murphy in Coming to America a film it probably inspired. Dundee is still exotic enough to feel like a fish out the water when he's coming to America and provide a funny view of New York City from a foreigner's perspective pinnacling with the famous 'knife' scene. It probably deals with more formulaic situations than the first act. We're not that thrilled by Linda's pompous fianc who naturally is totally different from Mick but it's Mick Dundee we follow with an interested eye evolving in an urban jungle full of prostitutes junkies and transvestites. The film doesn't sugarcoat the reality hence the unforgettable shot on Sue's swimsuit but it's faithful to Dundee's adventurous and friendly nature. I doubt he would have enjoyed staying in the hotel and watch I Love Lucy. The formula of the second act is redeemed by the way it's handled until the unforgettable climactic scene. But what the film succeeds is to create a defining character of the 80's a sympathetic macho icon who for once doesn't kill and doesn't take himself seriously and a great script rightfully Oscarnominated. I know I mentioned the script several times but that's because many directors would take the premise for granted and forget about the writing. The French tried to make their version through the infamous Little Indian Big City and although a commercial success the film was a disaster. The story was going from archetypal situations to convenient resolutions with no heart no wit no characterization no charm whatsoever.One must endure this horrific film to realize why Crocodile Dundee is so great believe me mate!".

Despite enjoying his work photography especially of the female form and drumming Crane wanted to be a movie star. So it was with some reluctance that he accepted the title starring role in a new television sitcom called Hogan's Heroes 1965 a WWII POW comedy. To his surprise the show became a hit and catapulted him to television stardom. The fame resulting from the show led to excesses and a meeting with home video salesman and technician John Carpenter with who he would form a friendship based on their mutual interests namely excessive sex for Crane purely heterosexual sex and capturing nude females on celluloid. His fame allowed Crane to have as much sex as he wanted which was incongruent to his somewhat wholesome television friendly image and the way he portrayed himself to almost everyone except Carpenter and his...";

	schema:reviewBody "I believe that this was the most severely underrated film of 2002 and it was also my personal favorite for a great year in film. Now I sincerely doubt that many moviegoers would consider this one of the year's best or even a great film so this comes with a tentative recommendation. I wouldn't recommend this movie to just anybody but I feel that fans of the prior work of Scorsese and Schrader will consider this a worthwhile endeavor. With this work Schrader continues his legacy of disturbed distorted doomed men whose selfishness and shallow nature ultimately lead them to great suffering as they destroy those who come close to them. Greg Kinnear's Bob Crane joins the likes of DeNiro's Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull Gene Hackman's Harry Caul in The Conversation and Nick Nolte's Wade Whitehouse in another Schrader masterpiece Affliction. These are sad empty men for whom we can only halfsympathize we feel for them because we suffer but we condemn them because they force themselves and others to suffer.The film follows the sexual exploits of Greg Kinnear as Bob Crane the reallife star of Hogan's Heroes who during and after the show became a fullblown sex addict ruining two marriages and possibly sabotaging his career in the process. Willem Dafoe is John Carpenter no I know what you're thinking and he's not Crane's partner in crime who lacks Crane's charisma with women but is fed some scraps by Crane in return for his extensive knowledge of and access to video equipment. Crane's fetish is using the home video cameras to record his sexual trysts which he reviews over and over again looking for something that we can't see and that he probably can't see either.Kinnear and Dafoe's performances alone are worth the price of admission. This is the best boldest and most nuanced work that Kinnear has ever done. His performance is all subtlety and detail he introduces Crane as a regular aw shucks family man but as the movie progresses we gradually see the facade fall as his quiet desperation and insatiable sexual appetite begin to consume him. Not content to go over the top and yell at the top of his lungs to be effective Kinnear instead puts on a fake smile and charms with a velvety voice while openly degrading and hitting on women. The effect is one of the most genuinely creepy performances ever committed to film. Dafoe is the perfect companion to Kinnear's subtle predator Carpenter is a pathetic loser easily angered and easily hurt. He gets angry yells and does all of the things that you've seen Dafoe do in his other portrayals of guys you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley or a lighted one for that matter. It's effective elsewhere and it's effective here. Together these men form a pair so utterly joyless and shallow that just seeing them onscreen together made my stomach churn. Their dialogue is only incidental usually reminiscing on previous sexual escapades or planning new ones but it's the little tics gestures Kinnear's untouchable confidence foiled by Dafoe's insecurity Kinnear's hidden hunger foiled by Dafoe's overt desperation that give these scenes their resounding power.Not to shortchange Schrader's direction though which as usual is right on target for the material. He begins in a brightly colored idealized suburban landscape filled with all of the usual imagery you'd expect in this sort of lighthearted period and location. Then slowly he slides into darker territory carrying us into the decadent seventies breaking shots into shorter lengths shaking the camera depicting with his cinematography and editing the fall of his protagonist. Admittedly the techniques Schrader employs here to depict Crane's breakdown have been used many times before but I still found them extremely effective here.For the last thirty minutes of the film I felt genuinely ill not because I thought the projector was out of focus as many have complained but because Schrader and Kinnear were taking me to a dark place and immersing me in it. As I said before this type of film is not for everybody but for those interested in the dark side of man this film is not to be missed. I think that at the very least the merit of these depressing morality tales is that they provide an exact blueprint of the way not to live our lives. I suppose that showing Crane checking himself into therapy and dealing with his problems and utimately healing himself would be valuable as well but it wouldn't make for a good film or a true one. Some people argue against the very existence of this type of movie. My response to them is that in real life for every strongwilled person who solves their problems and triumphs over adversity there is another loser who ultimately fails to deal with life and implodes upon their own insecurity and weakness. Until this changes someone needs to continue making these films.".

In Auto Focus' the family manpornographer turns out to be none other than the wellknown actor Bob Crane the star of TV's Hogan's Heroes' who was found murdered in a Scottsdale Arizona hotel room in 1978 under mysterious and sensational circumstances that included the uncovering of tapes Crane had made of his own sexual experiences.  The general public was shocked to discover that a man they had invited into their living rooms every week for six years had been living such an unsavory parallel existence  though those who knew him well were apparently far less shocked by the revelation.  Drawing on Robert Graysmith's book The Murder of Bob Crane' for its inspiration and viewpoint the film written by Michael Gerbosi and directed by Paul Schrader chronicles the rise and fall of this handsome actor from his days as a successful LA disc jockey and his meteoric rise to fame as star of a hit comedy series to his growing obsession with promiscuity and pornography which led to the disintegration of both his personal and professional life  and ultimately to his death most likely at the hands of his buddyinsleaze videographer John Carpenter though he was never convicted of the murder.  Auto Focus' certainly does not shy away from revealing many of the salacious details of this truelife story.  Schrader deals headon with the disturbing nature of a mind so all consumed with the subject of sex that all other aspects of life become obliterated and distorted.  What's fascinating about Crane  at least in the way he is depicted in this film  is that he seems to have had some sort of selfdestructive death wish for not only does he risk his career by sleeping with countless women but he insists on leaving behind the evidence by videotaping many of his encounters and then flaunting his accomplishments' to others in the Hollywood community.  In a way such a cavalier attitude only underlines the sickness at the core of Crane's soul  which in a perverse paradoxical way actually makes Crane a more sympathetic figure than he otherwise might be.   An enormous amount of credit for this also goes to Greg Kinnear who does a superb job of not only replicating Crane's style of acting but of showing us the tortured man Crane became in his later years.  He was truly a man driven to madness by the demons within him and we can all identify in some sense with that condition our demons may not be sexual in nature but they probably eat away at us just as ravenously as they did Crane.  Kinnear gets outstanding support from Willem Dafoe as Carpenter the Svengalilike figure who lures Crane into his world of photographed sex and Ron Leibman as Crane's wellmeaning caring agent who can do little but stand by helplessly as his client throws his career and his life away to feed this devouring passion.The filmmakers have done an amazing job capturing the sights and sounds of the era in which the film is set.  Especially impressive are the scenes recreating Hogan's Heroes' with Kurt Fuller in particular a standout as Werner Klemperer Colonel Klink.  It's also fascinating to see the evolution of videotape technology as portrayed in the film.  How many of us knew that such equipment existed for home consumption as early as the mid60's?  There's a real sadness to the final stretches of the film made all the more poignant by having the dirgelike musical score run uninterrupted under the action.  The effect is that we really get a sense of the total desolation of Crane's life at that point  as he has lost his family his career and his selfrespect to the master he chose early on to serve.   The loss of his life seems almost de rigueur given all that has gone before.  Auto Focus' is not always an easy film to watch but for its unflinching look at an oftenunappetizing subject it deserves to be seen.".

Greg Kinnear does a credible job of portraying the television star. However the part about Crane's murder is only dealt with in the final minutes of the film! That was very disappointing and I was hoping to find out something or at least be given more information. They just kind tacked this on the end of the film.Most of the film was about Crane's and Carpenter's escapades with women.....lots of women beautiful and bigchested women which you see in abundance in this film. Dafoe is the sleazy friend who introduces Crane to the beginning of the VCR age. That led to a whole bunch of sexonfilm and really whetted Crane's big sexual appetite. Anyway for people who watched Hogan's Heroes and there were plenty this is a bio of him and perhaps for those who know nothing about his death who killed him.".

When towards the end he visits his agent and is all messed up and starts saying sex is normal. I'm normal  Kinnear reaches a pinnacle in his young film acting career. I have always felt that actors ascend to the next level of craft and stardom when they breakthrough with a biographical role see  Denzel Washington in Malcom X Ben Kingsley in Ghandi Robert Downey Jr in Chaplin Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. And now Greg Kinnear has made that leap with Auto Focus a wellcrafted and seductive film by Paul Schrader Hollywood's last bastion of nonsugar coated filmmakers. Basically the story of Hollywood's most intriguing unsolved murder Auto Focus also pulls back the curtain on good guy Bob Crane's lecherous and painfully discombobulated private and secret life. What is also amazing about this film is how is records the birth of video and the VCR. Bob Crane turns out to be one of the pioneer users of this technology. When we see or hear video video cameras or VCRs we probably automatically think of home movies recording episodes of Star Trek or the Star Wars prequels' lack of cinematic quality. When Bob Crane heard about video cameras and VCRs he automatically thought of sex. Though the film makes no mention of it it is quite prophetic in showing us how the technology of video created hardcore pornography and turned it into a billion dollar industry. If you think about it nothing has profited more from video than porno and nothing ever relied so dearly on video like porno. Bob Crane instinctively felt this though he never was a pornographer so to speak he knew that sex and video can go hand in hand. Unfortunately this was also his downfall. Like most Paul Schrader writ or directed films by the end you get that queasy feeling the feeling you get at the end of Goodfellas the feeling of sadness that this great ride is over and the feeling of emptiness and loss that all that greatness came crashing down. Bob Crane's descent into moral madness can be sickening especially when juxtaposed with Hogan's Heroes. I almost felt the desire to shower to cleanse myself after viewing this film. I love movies that produce reactions from me movies that linger for days. This is one of them.".

It's more like a drug movie only here the drug being the opposite sex and almost a singularly male egotrip instead of common narcotics. But it's also a very fine character study where the idea of character is taken into consideration of how much one can seem a certain way but then be stuck in with flaws and insecurities and ultimately temptation. The last of which is what Schrader puts into focus early on but then after a while when temptation is gone the film becomes a direct plunge into complete debauchery. And appropriately like with all addicts for a while nothing seems wrong at all about all of this.Greg Kinnear is definitely in one of his best parts here as he plays someone who is an actor who keeps his actorlike charms off the set as well. In Hollywood away from the confines of Connecticut his Bob Crane lands the lead on Hogan's heroes but can't resist the first temptations of the nightlife. This comes in an introductory way and then throughout as a tagalongcounterpart with John Carpenter not the director played with the best match by Willem Dafoe of being a creep and alluring at times who shows him the ropes and hooks him up with video equipment. But as Crane goes deeper into his sexual drives divorces marries again and divorces again his acting career and his livelihood seem to slip away. The themes of being perversely the 'AllAmerican Male' are accentuated by Kinnear's Crane in voiceover as he talks about the unbridled joys of sex and in an interview with a Christian publication he says 'I don't...make waves'. By the last third of his story however into the rot of the 70s he's lost touch with the reality of his pleasures or rather necessities.Auto Focus isn't at times an easy movie to sit through it's even cringeworthy in a couple of scenes notably for me was when he guest stars on a celebrity cooking show only to keep on his sexuallydriven side with audience members. Then there are other scenes i.e. 'you have fingers up youknowwhere' and the genital enhancement where male masculinity is questioned and in very peculiar ways between Crane and Carpenter Crane is homophobic but then what exactly is Carpenter's function? More than anything less than being a friend he becomes a kind of unintentional pusher where the draw of going out on the town becomes a crux for both of the men. What's just as fascinating then is how Schrader aligns this with his style the first half is mostly very slick and professionallooking almost like an HBO biopic or something. But then as the characters lose a grip on everything except themselves there's a handheld distorted view to everything. There's lots of nudity and onscreen sex some blurred out likely by MPAA request yet Schrader gets something more shocking in the mind at least as Carpenter almost becomes the antagonist in a way as the story winds down the last phone call marks this most.Auto Focus has the ideal of the usual biographical drama of a somebody in Hollywood who soon loses himself to becoming a nobody but there's plenty under the surface that makes it more intriguing. Crane's two sides to his persona the celebrity one and the personal 'lifestyle' one become one and the same after a while Kinnear being able to make such a nearirredeemable person somewhat sympathetic or at the least very watchable.

	schema:headline " Complex film about a shallow man spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Bob Crane is always going on about what a likable guy he is. Well he may be polite and he may have a bland charm but can a man who cheats on two wives and ruins two marriages really be classed as likable? And Bob Crane also goes on about how normal he is. Well yes sex is normal and knocking about is hardly immoral but this is a married man with children who is sleeping around. And not only that but he's a man who doesn't seem to see anything wrong with it. Apparently everyone else has the problem. But he's also a man who tapes his sex sessions and who watches them with his best buddy. Likable and normal he most certainly isn't.What comes through strongest in Auto Focus is the strange homoerotic relationship between Bob Crane Greg Kinnear and John Carpenter Willem Dafoe. It's kind of a perverse love story. In the first scene they have together John almost serenades Bob. It's love at first sight. Then pretty soon afterwards they're scoring chicks together and filming their exploits.In fact the two characters kind of complete one another. At the beginning Bob is curious but kind of naive  he has 'photography' magazines and is almost embarrassed when he goes to his first strip joint  while John is horny and selfassured but being a mere mortal can hardly be guaranteed to score every time. So when the bumbling Bob and the confident John hook up they make a pretty good partnership.And at the beginning things go well. With Bob's celebrity and John's electronic gizmos they're bagging chicks and having fun. And at the start things are relatively tame  after years of dull marital sex Bob is excited merely at the prospect of doing it with the lights on. But as things progress the relationship between the two men gets more and more perverse. The first hint that this is more than mere macho tagteam screwing is the way they talk as they watch their tapes. John says to Bob Where have you been all my life? While Bob says to John It's either him or me in reference to one of John's other customers a customer that Bob doesn't like. This isn't a mere friendship.Then there's the way that Bob gets outraged when he sees via tape that during an orgy John has had his hand on his arse. When you're filming sex tapes with your best buddy and watching them together it seems rather churlish to complain about getting your bum groped.But although they have a bit of a lover's tiff over this they soon hook back up. And then in an extraordinary scene they watch another one of their tapes. At the time Bob is saying how much he misses his wife and child. But immediately afterwards he and his best buddy begin masturbating as they watch one of their recordings. And then as they're abusing themselves they begin to debate who the woman is and where it was filmed. To them this is completely normal. It's ordinary. No wonder neither is capable of a healthy relationship  they've chosen the surface photography and sex tapes over anything with real meaning.But that's one of the conundrums that Auto Focus presents. Where you're famous and when women are lining up to have sex with you fame is the best lubricant how can you be expected to exercise selfcontrol? Surely that's every man's dream. Well it probably is the dream of most men and it can hardly be a surprise that Crane cheated on his wives but what makes him so extraordinary is how completely lacking he is in selfawareness. He talks to priests Christian magazines and his agent seemingly sincere in the lies he spews I'm a one woman man. Bob Crane is a good guy. I'm normal.. He really does think that his wives are being unreasonable in expecting him to be faithful. He really does think that keeping an album of the women he's slept with and showing it to other people is okay. He really does think that there's nothing strange in watching sex tapes with his best buddy. His life is evidence of what happens when a shallow man with little intelligence is given fame.But although the character is shallow Greg Kinnear's performance is complex. He really doesn't a put a foot wrong. He's got the easy charm and wideeyed confusion down pat. He plays Bob as a man who is always sincere who is always polite and charming but who is constantly hurting those around him. And his performance is also incredibly seedy. I particularly like the way that he leers at his son's girlfriend. The man has no selfcontrol no idea of social mores. And there's a great piece of acting when he gets a barman to put Hogan's Heroes on so that he can pick up a couple of women. He feigns surprise so well when one of the women asks him whether he's the man off the show that I wouldn't be surprised if Crane fooled himself into thinking that he didn't in any way manipulate these women when he was picking them up.I also like scene when he receives a call from Disney. They want him for a film a film called Superdad. The way that he juggles sleaze and respectability is impeccable  right before the call he talks to John about making a sex movie and then he shows John his penis. Yep that's Superdad.But ultimately it's quite a sad film. Crane's death being beaten while asleep is both brutal and pathetic. Yes Crane wasn't a good man nor was he a normal one but he wasn't a bad man either. He certainly wasn't vindictive. He was just a sad seedy little man who died a sad seedy little death.".

His agent sees him as a combination of Jack Lemmon and Jack Benny a potential star of fluffy sex comedies with a benign sort of sex appeal and a knack for snappy oneliners All of that was a vast overestimation of Crane's talents.Crane reveled in the fame that Hogan brought him but he seems never to have taken a long view of his career. When the show ended he was left rudderless and idle having slowly cut the ties that bound him to ordinary life  his work a stable home life and his religious faith.While he coasted Crane took advantage of the easy cynical charm he conveyed on screen to lure women. By the dozen. I think he probably enjoyed being the least likely man in Hollywood to skulk strip clubs looking for prey and to devote thousands of yards of videotape to his exploits with them. But his naivete is telling Crane allows himself to be led into a netherworld by John Carpenter Willem Dafoe who teaches him that putting sex on film is more fun than having it.

	schema:reviewBody "Bob Crane was a well known TV face whose lopsided grin and cheekychappie personality took him to fame and modest fortune with the 196571 TV series Hogan's Heroes a family safe ripoff the film Stalag 17 but like many that have passed before him his human weaknesses  in his case towards free love porn and sleaze  provided his ultimate downfall.This is 1000 word review that could go exclusively many ways The most obvious would be simply to review the film as an entertainment piece which while fair and valid wouldn't tell the whole story. The second would be as an exploration of the moral questions raised taking on the very nature of addiction and obsession. A third would be to review the nature of show biz itself and how  like Crane  you can easily go from flavour of the month to being last year's model.In many ways the above debates are more interesting than the film itself which while being both credible and interesting never bursts in to full flame. Indeed it spends long periods not really going anywhere or doing anything other than following Crane and his selfstyled best friend John Carpenter not the famous director!  played by the oddball part specialist William Dafoe  from one sexual encounter to the next.The filming of these sexual encounters while true and unquestioned adds nothing to my understanding of Crane himself. The act would have happened filmed or unfilmed. Indeed I never did learn whether he had any REAL interest in photography  which he claims in the film proper  beyond using it as a device for gaining extra sex gratification. Equally how expensive is the early video equipment and his allembracing sex hobby? Are these the only reason he is broke after six years playing the lead in a hit TV show? Some of this partytoparty time would have been better spent explaining the early life of Crane allowing us to understand where he comes from better. Is he a classic case of someone who married too young and ended up spliced to his mother? And like real mother's they are always finding embarrassing items hidden around the house!However even this argument becomes devalued when you consider his second marriage  to a contrasting blonde libertarian sex pot  also ended in acrimony and divorce!Given that this is a film of best guesses mine would be that Crane never really had a proper teenage life he came from a strict Catholic household and wanted to live his out decades after the fact. This film wants to portray him as someone who was lead astray by others simply because that is easier to explain than someone who changes course dramatically of their own freewill.Crane was approaching middle age when he first met the technowizard and fellow sexual traveller John Carpenter his sexuality and taste simply couldn't have been influenced by any outside parties so late in life. Outsiders could only have been facilitators to living it out. Nevertheless his wider actions show a curious lack of maturity who else would skip off work on a primetime TV show in order to play drums behind some cheap stripper? Director Paul Schrader of Taxi Driver fame has obviously being watching a lot of TV movies recently and scratching his balding pate over how to cover familiar material family man presented with temptation rise and fall wages of sin etc. without clich. Not to mention filming what is unfilmable The inside of another man's head!He has come up with only partial answers and a few professional fudges Starting with a very standard approach complete with horrible cold fact giving voiceover about Hogan's Heroes before slowly sliding in to the modern creeping handheld camera with filters approach and technique.Something that works quite well with some productions presumably because we are used to documentary and news being presented in this manner. Maybe we subconsciously mistake poor production quality with reality? Here it adds little. Greg Kinear does an excellent job portraying not only Crane the ham actor but also Crane the daydream believer and sex junkie. While going a little glassyeyed and unfocused is in the scope of most actors Kinear never goes overthetop while slowly losing the plot. He also remains strangely sympathetic while exploiting his own fame and position for sexual purposes A male perspective but all I have. The film starts with Crane  the LA DJ  spouting the happygolucky banalities that radio professionals go in for before being further introduced as a bouncy success story who is going places in radioland. However he want to act and employs a touch wood agent to find him the right part. The upshot is an unlikely comedy about an unlikely German concentration camp.He is a non smoking non drinking church going Christian who rushes straight home  post radio show  to his long time straightlaced wife and pictureperfect children. In other words a great place to start a sexual and moral slide from!Crane like many empty men that stumble in to things that make their heart go boombangabang for the first time hasn't the wit and wherewith all to see the limits and short comings of their new found hobby. He didn't realize that not everybody took his easygoing view of casual sex and by not being selective he alienated people.No one should die because they enjoy casual consenting sex or cheat on their wives but Crane died never having learnt there was and is a life beyond cheap thrills and that your casual actions can hurt the ones you love the most. A simple message but Auto Focus takes 105 minutes to get it across.".

Director Paul Schrader of Taxi Driver fame has obviously being watching a lot of TV movies recently and scratching his balding pate over how to cover familiar material family man presented with temptation rise and fall wages of sin etc. without clich. Not to mention filming what is unfilmable The inside of another man's head!He has come up with only partial answers and a few professional fudges Starting with a very standard approach complete with horrible cold fact giving voiceover about Hogan's Heroes before slowly sliding in to the modern creeping handheld camera with filters approach and technique.Something that works quite well with some productions presumably because we are used to documentary and news being presented in this manner. Maybe we subconsciously mistake poor production quality with reality? Here it adds little. Greg Kinear does an excellent job portraying not only Crane the ham actor but also Crane the daydream believer and sex junkie. While going a little glassyeyed and unfocused is in the scope of most actors Kinear never goes overthetop while slowly losing the plot. He also remains strangely sympathetic while exploiting his own fame and position for sexual purposes A male perspective but all I have. The film starts with Crane  the LA DJ  spouting the happygolucky banalities that radio professionals go in for before being further introduced as a bouncy success story who is going places in radioland. However he want to act and employs a touch wood agent to find him the right part. The upshot is an unlikely comedy about an unlikely German concentration camp.He is a non smoking non drinking church going Christian who rushes straight home  post radio show  to his long time straightlaced wife and pictureperfect children. In other words a great place to start a sexual and moral slide from!Crane like many empty men that stumble in to things that make their heart go boombangabang for the first time hasn't the wit and wherewith all to see the limits and short comings of their new found hobby. He didn't realize that not everybody took his easygoing view of casual sex and by not being selective he alienated people.No one should die because they enjoy casual consenting sex or cheat on their wives but Crane died never having learnt there was and is a life beyond cheap thrills and that your casual actions can hurt the ones you love the most. A simple message but Auto Focus takes 105 minutes to get it across.";

The trunk of this tree is the war picture in particular the character of American soldiers and  even more pointed  situations that place them in context with those of other nations. This trunk includes such stalwarts as the Americans in Great Escape' and Kwai' where they were notably more independent and plucky than others. Antiauthoritarian interested in girls.' More universally moral but reluctantly so.Wherever there is a strain of films defining archetypes there is a countering strain to subvert or exploit the archetype. So we had TeeVee shows like You'll never Get Rich' 55 where Sgt Bilko took all the positives and made fun of them. Hogan's Heros' was an extension more abstract and internationally conscious.But there was a subversion of THAT the revelation that Crane was inordinately openly promiscuous even by Hollywood standards. That was news because we already had moved the fold.' By that I mean that the point before was in defining what Americans were by straight depiction. With these TeeVee shows enormously popular there was a shift the American was defined as this sophisticated being that was sufficiently selfaware and confident that they could make fun of the old' selves. In other words the definition moved to the actor who embodied a charm and clean humor. Crane and others had dual jobs they were as much personalities as characters and those personalities helped us in making up who we were.The subversion therefore was this character full of charm looking us straight in the eye and telling us that opportunistic sex was not only good but a key component of American charm. All of a sudden the backlog of film double entendres  all those Cary Grantlike seductions  made this make sense. This stuff is what contributed to the crisis of the late sixties the invention of a medialed counterculture of folding and the sexdrugs part of the trinity.All well and fine. Schrader knows the Crane story is not a simple thread of boy gets success and the excess destroys him.' Those stories are tired  and in this case just wasn't true anyway. Schrader turns this into an examination of examining a film about filming a peek at peeking. The devil in this somewhat fictitious version of the story is not someone with sex or drugs but with video technology. The enticement here is not the sex  Crane was already well into that in the radio days  but the act of filming. The act of charming people into being filmed and sitting around a TeeVee transfixed in masturbation.Schrader is always best with these types of complexities. A film about film in film corrupting everything ON the film and making its point by that same selfcorrupting mechanism. It is where the name comes from. Long time collaborator DaFoe understands this. The obvious strategy was that the Crane character be completely unaware of any of these mechanics a real gamble. So far a work of genius. But then he gets behind the camera. His actual execution is so concerned with making things work' he loses sight of what he is about. What we end up is mechanically competent but lifeless the genius is bleached away.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll admit I only knew a few vague details about Bob Crane before watching Paul Schrader's Auto Focus. But whether you know about him or not this is a great movie about a man seduced by fame and overcome by his weaknesses and addictions who finally spirals downward into a living hell. The transition from a happily married man on his way up to stardom to a desperate man with his life in ruins is almost seamless. Even the camera work changes at first it runs completely smoothly but by the end it seems to just drift drunkenly to targets out of frame and focus. Bob Crane is portrayed as a real nice guy. Doesn't drink doesn't smoke. His only major flaw and it is major is that he is a sex addict. One out of three's not bad as he so innocently puts it. It all isn't really about sex though. Watch it and you'll see very little sex actually takes place on screen. It is all mostly about the lifestyle which is a key importance in any film about addiction whether the addiction is alcohol cocaine or in this case sex. Bob Crane and his buddy John Carpenter regularly go cruising for women to have sex with and as Crane's celebrity decreases so does the quality and quantity of women. This leaves him more and more desperate. He becomes obsessed with editing his sex videos and starts to lose his grip with reality. He appears on a cooking show and makes obscene comments to a woman in the audience. He doesn't really care because he knows they'll just edit it all out. This is without a doubt Greg Kinnear's best performance to date and Willem Dafoe gives his creepiest performance...well of that particular year. Auto Focus is more than just your typical Hollywood scandal film it rises to degrees so much higher and darker than that. This is a film that sticks with you and really makes you think. My rating 1010".

Williem Dafoe stars as John Carpenter a salacious character who provides the Hollywood jet setters with cutting edge technology such as home video devices and hifi car stereo systems.  The film directed by Paul Schrader focuses on Crane's successes and failures  both with his career and his wives as well as his abnormal sexual addiction we witness Crane's transformation and self destruction once he gets involved with Carpenter.  Essentially Auto Focus shows how a good man can be lured into degeneracy because of his insecurities.We first see Bob as a nice likable' family man working in radio  a nondrinker.     A codependent relationship quickly develops between Crane and Carpenter after they first meet on the set of Hogan's Heroes. Carpenter is a smooth talking snake who entices Crane with his techno expertise all the while he preying on Crane's popularity and likeability'  using Bob in order to seduce women while the video is rolling.

Although Crane is in the height of his popularity he relishes in moonlighting at the clubs playing his drums  encouraged by Carpenter.  Carpenter affectionately calls Crane Big Daddy' and makes reference to their relationship as Batman  Robin Lone Ranger  Tonto'.  These two men become inseparable and it is somewhat disturbing of how needy and influential they are on each other.This film clearly shows Crane's downward spiral into Carpenter's hell. Paul Schrader also directed other infamous films that involve complex male sexuality situations' such as Taxi Driver and American Gigolo.  Schrader provides us with some brilliant subliminal techniques in his transformation of Crane by the combination of motifs and colors.  For example in the beginning of the film before Crane meets Carpenter we see many scenes that contain the Madonna with Child both at the Crane's church and inside their home.  The colors in these scenes are bright and vibrant  primarily whites aquas and greens.  This motif changes once the men meet from spiritual and clean to evil and ominous Carpenter is always dressed in red or black or both  signifying he is a dangerous villain devil of sorts.  The bright happy colors have been replaced by dark scenes and reds such as the strip clubs  the lights candles curtains and carpet.  Even Carpenter's home has red carpet and lights his car a shiny red javelin has two chrome exhaust pipes sticking out the back representing horns!By the end of the movie Crane has transformed from a likeable nice guy to a creepy washed up alcoholic without morals family or friends.

	schema:headline " Portrait of a sleazebag";
	schema:reviewBody "SpoilersAuto Focus' is Paul Schrader's version of the rise and fall of Bob Crane the star of the WW II prisoner of war comedy Hogan's Heroes.'  Hogan' ran successfully from 1964 to 1971 with endless reruns since and as it ran and went into reruns Crane slid progressively downhill in the relentless pursuit of a sex addiction that wrecked his career and prematurely ended his life. Greg Kinnear gamely attacks the lead role in Paul Schrader's Hollywood biopic of this horrendously unfortunate man.Crane as we see him here is constantly urged on by his sidekick John Carpenter a role performed with his usual satanic relish by Willem Dafoe. Unfortunately Dafoe looks a little old to be playing a sex maniac.Carpenter is a pioneering agent for video equipment who's fired when color video arrives and his boss discovers he's color blind.  From then on the rather humiliating role of Dafoe's character becomes nothing but to set up orgies in which he and Crane star  and to shoot pornographic videos of the proceedings to be viewed later.It's something new to see Kinnear playing such a distasteful role if all too familiar to see Dafoe in one.  The relationship is a mutually exploitive marriage of addict and enabler.  Crane's fame and his charm considerable in Kinnear's performance make it all possible allowing him to smooth the path to his own downfall.  As represented by Mr. Schrader and his writers Robert Graysmith and Michael Gerbosi Crane has little behind his ingratiating manner but a mindless lust for sex.  His selfdoubt consists of nothing more than an occasional fear of being caught.Bob is a Catholic and a family man but he easily slides into the relentless and daily pursuit of his slimy hobby first playing drums in strip bars while still working in Hogan's Heroes' and partying with the staff afterward later engaging in the endless orgies on tour which Dafoe's character arranges.  Crane's sex obsession spills over into Polaroids and videos of every orgy and to watching them and masturbating with his sidekick while trying to recall the scene.  Was that Cleveland?'  No it was Scottsdale.'  Such dialogue might have been funny but it's only pathetic here.Crane's first marriage ends  and we see this grimly depicted. The second marriage with the female lead on Hogan' takes longer to selfdestruct because this time the wife begins knowing about all the girls and claiming to accept them. Eventually as depicted here she becomes disaffected and alcoholic.Never has Paul Schrader been in a more relentless mood. The only queasy element of interest in this slow descent is the growing irony of Crane's persistent charm.  I'm normal' he repeatedly says whenever it's pointed out also repeatedly how creepy he's become.  It's obvious Schrader doesn't overstress this but neither does he develop it in any depth that Dafoe's character is sexually attracted to Crane and emotionally dependent on him and that this is one sick devouring relationship.Word gets around about Bob's grungy lifestyle and his reputation sinks to zero in Hollywood.  He and his agent agree he has to start over so he tells Carpenter their relationship has to end along with the dinner theater tours that have facilitated the orgies.Carpenter responds by bashing Bob's head in.  In real life he was acquitted of murder charges but the movie doesn't buy that.  This finale happens in Scottsdale Arizona.  End of story.  It's curiously like the death of Joe Orton and makes the two men's relationship seem emotionally if not physically homosexual.Mostly Kinnear's able performance  which might well have been troubling and moving in a subtler more rounded movie  consists of showing Crane pretending to be cheerful and amiable when we know his life is going down the tubes.  Kinnear's Crane tirelessly puts on the standard good guy celebrity front.  He's the kind of star who never refuses an autograph never loses his chipper urge to charm.  It's only in the last quarter of the movie that Kinnear is called upon to show Crane's physical and mental decline visibly happening on screen.  During this period Carpenter Dafoe becomes increasingly frantic knowing he's about to be deprived of his reason for being.  Instead of a subtle and haunting alteration of relationship like that of James Fox and Dick Bogarde in Losey and Pinter's The Servant' the dialogue in Auto Focus' just repeats the same formulas.Schrader doesn't trust Kinnear or Dafoe to convey the progression through acting.  Instead he makes the movie become crudely expressionistic switching to jerky handheld cameras and changing the movie's whole style in a grotesquely intrusive way.  Angelo Badalamenti's music which had seemed merely odd and out of sync at times now becomes heavyhandedly ominous. Badalamenti's compositions seem campy and stylized when they accompany David Lynch's bizarre sequences but here they're just gratingly portentous.

	onyx:emotionText "SpoilersAuto Focus' is Paul Schrader's version of the rise and fall of Bob Crane the star of the WW II prisoner of war comedy Hogan's Heroes.'  Hogan' ran successfully from 1964 to 1971 with endless reruns since and as it ran and went into reruns Crane slid progressively downhill in the relentless pursuit of a sex addiction that wrecked his career and prematurely ended his life. Greg Kinnear gamely attacks the lead role in Paul Schrader's Hollywood biopic of this horrendously unfortunate man.Crane as we see him here is constantly urged on by his sidekick John Carpenter a role performed with his usual satanic relish by Willem Dafoe. Unfortunately Dafoe looks a little old to be playing a sex maniac.Carpenter is a pioneering agent for video equipment who's fired when color video arrives and his boss discovers he's color blind.  From then on the rather humiliating role of Dafoe's character becomes nothing but to set up orgies in which he and Crane star  and to shoot pornographic videos of the proceedings to be viewed later.It's something new to see Kinnear playing such a distasteful role if all too familiar to see Dafoe in one.  The relationship is a mutually exploitive marriage of addict and enabler.  Crane's fame and his charm considerable in Kinnear's performance make it all possible allowing him to smooth the path to his own downfall.  As represented by Mr. Schrader and his writers Robert Graysmith and Michael Gerbosi Crane has little behind his ingratiating manner but a mindless lust for sex.  His selfdoubt consists of nothing more than an occasional fear of being caught.Bob is a Catholic and a family man but he easily slides into the relentless and daily pursuit of his slimy hobby first playing drums in strip bars while still working in Hogan's Heroes' and partying with the staff afterward later engaging in the endless orgies on tour which Dafoe's character arranges.  Crane's sex obsession spills over into Polaroids and videos of every orgy and to watching them and masturbating with his sidekick while trying to recall the scene.  Was that Cleveland?'  No it was Scottsdale.'  Such dialogue might have been funny but it's only pathetic here.Crane's first marriage ends  and we see this grimly depicted. The second marriage with the female lead on Hogan' takes longer to selfdestruct because this time the wife begins knowing about all the girls and claiming to accept them. Eventually as depicted here she becomes disaffected and alcoholic.Never has Paul Schrader been in a more relentless mood. The only queasy element of interest in this slow descent is the growing irony of Crane's persistent charm.  I'm normal' he repeatedly says whenever it's pointed out also repeatedly how creepy he's become.  It's obvious Schrader doesn't overstress this but neither does he develop it in any depth that Dafoe's character is sexually attracted to Crane and emotionally dependent on him and that this is one sick devouring relationship.Word gets around about Bob's grungy lifestyle and his reputation sinks to zero in Hollywood.  He and his agent agree he has to start over so he tells Carpenter their relationship has to end along with the dinner theater tours that have facilitated the orgies.Carpenter responds by bashing Bob's head in.  In real life he was acquitted of murder charges but the movie doesn't buy that.  This finale happens in Scottsdale Arizona.  End of story.  It's curiously like the death of Joe Orton and makes the two men's relationship seem emotionally if not physically homosexual.Mostly Kinnear's able performance  which might well have been troubling and moving in a subtler more rounded movie  consists of showing Crane pretending to be cheerful and amiable when we know his life is going down the tubes.  Kinnear's Crane tirelessly puts on the standard good guy celebrity front.  He's the kind of star who never refuses an autograph never loses his chipper urge to charm.  It's only in the last quarter of the movie that Kinnear is called upon to show Crane's physical and mental decline visibly happening on screen.  During this period Carpenter Dafoe becomes increasingly frantic knowing he's about to be deprived of his reason for being.  Instead of a subtle and haunting alteration of relationship like that of James Fox and Dick Bogarde in Losey and Pinter's The Servant' the dialogue in Auto Focus' just repeats the same formulas.Schrader doesn't trust Kinnear or Dafoe to convey the progression through acting.  Instead he makes the movie become crudely expressionistic switching to jerky handheld cameras and changing the movie's whole style in a grotesquely intrusive way.  Angelo Badalamenti's music which had seemed merely odd and out of sync at times now becomes heavyhandedly ominous. Badalamenti's compositions seem campy and stylized when they accompany David Lynch's bizarre sequences but here they're just gratingly portentous.  We realize this grim morality play has nowhere to go.  Bob was doomed from the start.Early on when Bob has just begun playing drums in strip bars he schedules a meeting with his priest in a coffee shop and tells the good father what he's been doing.  Would you be more comfortable talking about this in the confessional?' the priest asks.  No' Bob answers.  Presumably Schrader would like to take us to the confessional but he can't.

It starts high it ends low we know that already.  And let's face it we are interested in the film because we are morbidly fascinated with the low part.  So the filmmaker's task is not to deliver the usual story arch but instead to both show the character's descent AND to give us new insight into the character causing us to feel for him and understand his story in a way we did not know before seeing the film.  Otherwise it is a documentary or a Biography on the History Channel. On this our group agreed we left the theater feeling like little more than passive observers into Bob Crane's life.  Instead of character development we are treated to a series of vignettes and asked to connect the dots ourselves.  As a result we never cared that much for him he was shallow smarmy and we were not given enough of the people in his life to care for them so we were never torn apart when he began his descent into hell.  The filmmaker's alternate approach is to force us the audience to become voyeurs too.  Our group sat through the movie both repulsed and attracted to what we saw but with no emotional insight gained we were no better for the experience. Ask yourself this if the film had been about the life and death of sex addict John Doe would it have worked?  No  it would have been booed off the screen.  Lacking any real depth the film requires the audience's obsession with celebrity in order for it to succeed.  Movies about descent can be fascinating just look at Lost Weekend or Double Indemnity for two classics that come to mind. But Autofocus ain't in that league.

	schema:reviewBody "British author and writer Philip Ridley has done very little in the field of cinema but what there is is more than interesting and great especially in the case of this debut of his Reflecting Skin 1990. The film stars Jeremy Cooper as a some 10 year old boy named Seth Dove who lives in the rural areas of America in the 1950's when the WWII is still very freshly in minds. Seth has friends whom he plays with like boys normally do but it seems like they are always very cold and wicked towards each other and that something isn't quite right. Seth's father and mother are also more than ominous and weird. Soon Seth's older brother arrives in home from WWII in which he served during the bombing of Japan. Brother Cameron is played by Viggo Mortensen and first he and Seth seem to be very close with each other but not for long. Also a weird lady lives near Seth's house and the lady  despite being very attractive  is also very bizarre and threatening and almost like a vampire in a fairy tales which Seth's father happens to read all the time. There's no need to tell more about the plot you've got it by this point that this film isn't going to be any optimistic and positive pack of 90 minutes entertainment. This is nearly as disturbing as possible and has characters and settings which would make and hopefully have made or will make David Lynch give a huge hug to Philip.Reflecting Skin is the kind of film a director manages to do perhaps just once during his career. It tries to reach the top which is so high it is almost impossible to succeed or at least succeed more than once in subsequent films. Reflecting Skin  I have really come to this conclusion  really succeeds and how fantastically it does! I knew this film will be a tough and challenging one but it was more when I finally FINALLY managed to find it and watch it. The film has absolutely zero likable characters or characters who can be described as good or good willing. They are all bad others more and others less. Others may have had an opportunity not to become that way due to their young age while others are so corrupted and rotten they should have been 'saved' when they were still vulnerable kids themselves. This film shows the kind of things about childhood and growing up many parents wouldn't probably even dare to thing about but still I think this should be seen by every parent who is going to have or already has had a child who is waiting to be raised as a decent and undisturbed human being. But what about Seth since he is also very mean and selfish at many points? I think it is among the points and things which make this film so powerful and merciless because there's absolutely no hope for the characters of the film they're gonedestroyed for ever and others just can't take it and go completely insane and self destuctive. But there's hope for us the viewers who accept the film's challenging subjects and things from our everyday life. This film teaches shows enlightens and horrifies us as powerfully as it makes us wonder the visual beauty and settings of the film.The visual eye of Ridley's is great and wonderful and Reflecting Skin proved it for the first time in big screen. The collaboration of Ridley and cinematographer Dick Pope The Way of the Gun is among the greatest I've seen for long time. The fields and rural settings are so gorgeous and the colors in which they bathe really fill this film with cinematic magic which is also present in Ridley's The Passion of Darkly Noon 1995 which was photographed by John de Borman. Darkly Noon fails a little as it hasn't got characters as deep as they should but visually Reflecting Skin and Darkly Noon are equally brilliant and stunning. Due to the much stronger and disturbing emotional content and elements of Reflecting Skin the visual beauty naturally gives a huge contrast to the experience and also a goal which should be reached by the film's characters unless it wasn't already too late for them.Music is very important element in Cinema and Reflecting Skin shines on that level too. Nick Bict composed both Darkly Noon and Reflecting Skin but the soundtrack in the latter really stayed into my mind after the first viewing. It is very close to Clint Mansell's unique power in Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream's 2000 soundtrack. Aronofsky's film would not be as powerful without Mansell's heart stopping and breaking music and that is also the case with Reflecting Skin. The final image and last 2 minutes of Reflecting Skin would be extremely intense without the music but now they are perfectly harrowing and powerful thanks to the talent and gift of Nick Bict.These ultra powerful and harrowing films usually have at least one element in common the final scene sequence or image which usually takes the viewer as far as possible and truly tests the tolerance without never being gratuitous or exploitative. Reflecting Skin's ending is heart breakingly harrowing mostly because of the fact that Seth has never given clues of something like this during the film and thus it comes pretty unexpectedly but still very understandably as it all tightens the film's message and theme for the last time. The ending is very powerful and so is the artist behind this film.Ridley has also written the screenplay for Peter Medak's The Krays on same year 1990 but that film has different themes and is not as important and personal as Reflecting Skin but still The Krays is recommended for those interested in Ridley. It is very sad and weird that Ridley hasn't done anything in the field of cinema for many years as far as I know Darkly Noon is so far the last film he has done because it would be so great if there was some future projects and cinema plans for the director. I really hope Ridley would continue making films one day because world needs his kind of film makers.I can't say anything which would give Reflecting Skin less than 1010 because it lacks all the things  mostly little too shallow characters  which make The Krays and Darkly Noon a little less effective and striking works. Reflecting Skin is a true masterpiece but only for those who can accept and stand extremely depressing and harrowing images situations human destinies and over all atmosphere and most importantly honest and uncompromising cinema.".

	onyx:emotionText "British author and writer Philip Ridley has done very little in the field of cinema but what there is is more than interesting and great especially in the case of this debut of his Reflecting Skin 1990. The film stars Jeremy Cooper as a some 10 year old boy named Seth Dove who lives in the rural areas of America in the 1950's when the WWII is still very freshly in minds. Seth has friends whom he plays with like boys normally do but it seems like they are always very cold and wicked towards each other and that something isn't quite right. Seth's father and mother are also more than ominous and weird. Soon Seth's older brother arrives in home from WWII in which he served during the bombing of Japan. Brother Cameron is played by Viggo Mortensen and first he and Seth seem to be very close with each other but not for long.

	schema:reviewBody "As a psychologist who has worked with child abuse victims and their families for over 30 years and as a survivor of horrific child abuse myself I would say that The Reflecting Skin is the most psychologically accurate depiction of child abuse that I've ever seen. And certainly the most uncompromising in terms of not romanticizing the victim. In The Reflecting SkinSPOILER ALERTthe central victim is an 8yearold farm boy who is traumatized at one time or another by nearly everyone in his life. His mother Ruth rejects him and punishes him with water poisoning. His father Luke commits suicide in front of him. A depressed young widow Dolphin Blue terrorizes him with details of her husband's suicide and remnants of his corpse she has saved in a cigar box. Even his beloved older brother Cameron who himself is a victim of both his mother's incestuous advances and the US military's atomic testing program in the Pacific is sometimes physically and emotionally abusive towards himat one point showing him the photo of a Hiroshima baby with reflecting skin from which the film takes its names. But unlike the usual tearjerker Hollywood movie about child abuse Seth is no more an innocent angel than is his brother or his father or his friends who get murdered. At the point we meet Seth running through a Van Goghcolored field with a huge toad in his hands he is already turning into the next generation of abuserhappily blowing up that toad with air the same way his mother blows him up with water. And he manages to retaliate against one of the adult abusers in his environment Dolphin Blue in the process. But he doesn't mean to kill her. Yet that is where his silence about the gang of serial killers he sees roaming the country roads in a black Caddy finally leads. That is the realization that finally shatters him. But what alternative to silence does he have? The best chance he has of stopping the killers is when Sheriff Ticker tries to force him into spilling his secrets. Yet the sheriff is so verbally abusive to Setheven to the point of threatening to split Seth's head open to get the truth out of himthat Seth freezes and says nothing. Like most abused kids Seth believes that he's entirely on his own. And to judge from all the negative reviews of this film he has reason to feel that no one will understand him and know how to help him. Because of all the abuse he's already internalized at the point the film begins he is no more lovable as a victim than the mummified fetus he tries to make his friend.".

It's worth it. It would spoil the film to give away too much. And director Philip Ridley interweaves everything together masterfully. I mean MASTERFULLY. When you watch it you'll know what I mean.Young Seth lives in rural America at the end of WWII. Kids are getting killed in the town. Seth and his friends are convinced his creepy neighbor lady who always wears sunglasses and is pale and British is the culprit and that she's a vampire. Seth's brother played by a young Viggo Mortenson comes home from the war and promptly falls in love with the neighbor lady. Of course this horrifies Seth. And stuff even starts to happen to his brother to confirm his suspicions. But there's a reason. You probably shouldn't know more. There are a couple of different plot threads. They are all haunting. Especially the backstory involving Mortenson which I found chilling. One monologue to the British lady about his experiences in the war he tells with absolute innocence when you see it you understand given the time period is bloodcurdling. The scenerycinematography is amazing. Lot of remarkable imagery. Stuffs that REALLY sticks in your mind. Not just the images of little kids bounding through wheat fields which there are plenty of but the way the houses seem utterly rooted into the landscape. The way the whole atmosphere has a strange haunted feeling. Great stuff. Highly recommended. Nothing TOO terribly frightening but LOTS of creepiness. Actually the whole film is just plain creepy.".

However Seth becomes fixated with a reclusive widow named Dolphin Blue and convinced she is a vampire believes she is responsible for the death of his friends. He also believes she is out to kill his older brother Cameron and will stop at nothing to save him.This film deals with dark psychological territory that some viewers may find disturbing. However I do recommend you watch this film as Philip Ridley has directed a film that shows how a child's imagination can be extremely overactive but also it shows just how cruel the adult world can be.The film is also shot in a very beautiful way. It oozes atmosphere and the use of colour in the film is fantastic. Ridley combines successfully the colours Blue Yellow Black Grey and white and it just brings the film to life.I do recommend this film to anyone as i have done to my friends who have loved it.

	schema:reviewBody "If you watch THE REFLECTING SKIN closely or even not so closely you'll notice that it sucks.  This is a film that tosses in bits and pieces of imagery and motifs that might have come from AmericanSouthern gothic sources like Sam Shepard Flannery O'Connor William Faulkner David Lynch Anne Rice and Tobe Hooper and others  but it fails to make its world seem the least bit vital or interesting.  All we are left with are pseudodisturbing characters and bits of imagery that don't want to fit together the cliched townie puritans and religious fanatics a dead baby an English neighbor nearby who may or may not be a vampire an hysterical mother with a husband who is a repressed homosexual and most strangely there is a group of greaser murdererpedophiles who drive around almost completely unnoticed in a shiny black Plymouth.  This narrative is all led by a 9 year old protagonist boy named Seth Dove and his stock set of small town friends and his older brother Cam played by Viggo Mortensen who just returned from fighting the Japanese.Not much really happens in this film except that there is a lot of yelling and menacing looks.  Seth runs back and forth between the different characters and locales as though he were attending exhibits at the Yakpanatwa sorry about the spelling Country Fair for Southern Gothic Cliches.  Occasionally he or one of his friends runs around draped in an American flag.  Hmmm  this must have some sort of deep meaning.  But who cares about subtext when text is so boring and phony?The film has some nice cinematography which is what makes it tolerable to watch.  But as it goes on you begin to realize that this overemphasis on visual beauty is a kind of device to distract the audience from possibly realizing that there is nothing interesting going on.Disparate stock characters and cliches from American gothic horror and southern gothic sources could be interesting if it all these elements were supported by a unique screenplay and guided by a gifted director go rent Jim Jarmusch's DEAD MAN which is not a great film but a much better one that takes a similar approach to its material.  But this writerdirector unfortunately has little such skill in either department.  The acting is mostly over the top though many of the actors are good and there is little suspense or mystery about the visual style and directorial approach.  By trying to bombard the audience with style especially the excruciatingly over the top orchestral and choral score the director proves to have hardly any style at all.One gets the sense that this director is not an American  but for some reason felt compelled to try to say something deep and meaningful about America.  One gets the sense that he doesn't really know these characters at all  or the land they live on.  Yet perhaps as a kid this director feverishly and fetishistically read and viewed materials about death perversity and horror in the Midwest and Great Plains  and could only come up with a kind of Wisconsin Death Trip for Basic Cable.  Nice try. Better luck next time.".

Occasionally he or one of his friends runs around draped in an American flag.  Hmmm  this must have some sort of deep meaning.  But who cares about subtext when text is so boring and phony?The film has some nice cinematography which is what makes it tolerable to watch.  But as it goes on you begin to realize that this overemphasis on visual beauty is a kind of device to distract the audience from possibly realizing that there is nothing interesting going on.Disparate stock characters and cliches from American gothic horror and southern gothic sources could be interesting if it all these elements were supported by a unique screenplay and guided by a gifted director go rent Jim Jarmusch's DEAD MAN which is not a great film but a much better one that takes a similar approach to its material.  But this writerdirector unfortunately has little such skill in either department.  The acting is mostly over the top though many of the actors are good and there is little suspense or mystery about the visual style and directorial approach.  By trying to bombard the audience with style especially the excruciatingly over the top orchestral and choral score the director proves to have hardly any style at all.One gets the sense that this director is not an American  but for some reason felt compelled to try to say something deep and meaningful about America.  One gets the sense that he doesn't really know these characters at all  or the land they live on.  Yet perhaps as a kid this director feverishly and fetishistically read and viewed materials about death perversity and horror in the Midwest and Great Plains  and could only come up with a kind of Wisconsin Death Trip for Basic Cable.  Nice try. Better luck next time.";

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1950's era Seth Dove a young seven year old deals with his highly dysfunctional family. The film takes place in the farmlands of Idaho. The strange neighbor women Dolphin Blue lives close to Seth. He's convinced that she is a vampire. Mainly because Seth reads to many comics and has a wild imagination. When Seth and his friends blow up a frog and it explodes on Dolphin his mother forces him to go to her house and apologize. Dolphin is very strange and constantly talks of her dead husband. Meanwhile a serial killer is on the loose killing the towns children. Seth's dad is accused. To prove his innocents in a manic depressive way he drinks gasoline and lights himself on fire. This scene kind of reminded me of Jodorowsky's Santa Sangre. After the father's death Seth's brother returns from the military and starts dating Dolphin. Seth is afraid that she wants to suck the life out of him. Seth also finds a dead baby in a pile of hay. He keeps it under his bed convinced it's an angel of his dead friend. British playwright and author Philip Ridley's debut film The Reflecting Skin is very bleak and disturbing. At times reminiscent of David Lynch it's a surreal coming of age drama that shows a kids perspective on tragedy. This is probably one of the most depressing films I've seen next to Dancer in the Dark. Although very bleak it's still an excellent film. Also check out Ridley's other film The Passion of Darkly Noon.".

Seth lives with his father Luke Dove Duncan Fraser who runs a gas station and a junkyard in the middle of nowhere and with his dysfunctional mother Ruth Dove Sheila Moore who misses her son Cameron Dove Viggo Mortensen that fought in the Pacific. One day Luke is reading a vampire pulp and Seth asks his father about vampires. When Seth has to apologize for a prank to his neighbor the widow Dolphin Blue Lindsay Duncan he believes she is a vampire. Eben is found murdered and Sheriff Ticker Robert Koons and his Deputy David Bloom blame Luke that has record of molestation. Luke does not bear the accusation and commits suicide while Seth believes Dolphin killed Eben. Cameron returns and soon he has a love affair with Dolphin while his little brother tries to discourage his brother to meet her. Kim is abducted by a group of youths in a black Cadillac and Seth witnesses the kidnapping. Soon Kim's body is found in a barn but Seth does not tell the Sheriff. When Dolphin asks for a ride to the driver of the Cadillac Seth does not warn her. What will happen to Dolphin? The Reflecting Skin is an unknown little gem by Philip Ridley with one of the darkest and weirdest stories of cinema. The disturbing plot is very well constructed and uses the innocence of a wicked eight year old boy and how he fantasizes his interpretation of reality. All the characters are nonlikable and vicious from the children and families to the Sheriff and his Deputy. The cinematography is also very beautiful in the rural landscape with bright colors. My vote is eight.Title Brazil O Reflexo do Mal The Reflection of Evil".

	schema:reviewBody "Reflecting Skin is in many ways a unique creation.  It operates at many levels each of which should be taken on its own terms and understood within its own logic.  Devastating social critique is entangled together with brilliantly shot natural landscapes especially the combination of azure skies and sweeping fields of golden wheat.  Dark and semipsychotic scenes of Seth's father's selfimmolation are entwined with the gentle lyricism of Cameron's falling in love with the vampire woman Dolphin Blue.  Taken together all these elements produce a dark unsettling relentlessly haunting atmosphere of the most profound spiritual crisis.  Reflecting Skin is about the rockbottom of sociocultural devastation it is about the wasteland lying inside each of us.Philip Ridley shows us the isolated world totally devoid of all GENUINE sense of moral direction.  The actor who plays a 9year old Seth is absolutely excellent in portraying a frightened wellmeaning rural boy who has already absorbed all the unspeakable cruelty of his family and wider local milieu.  The greatest nighmare of the film it seems to me is the destructively stubborn denial within which all characters are deeply and inextricably mired.  There is nothing they are afraid more of than looking at themselves at the profound evil which had already turned their souls into the most frightening desert.  They are prepared to look around for vampires witches and other incarnations of evil rather than to confront the layers of hypocrisy sanctimony and callousness within which they are hopelessly bogged down.  They are blind to their own faults but are filled with immeasurable hate towards the evil forces out there. One is simply astonished at how successfully Ridley portrays the reservoirs of hatred and existential frustration hovering over the settlement.  The movie traces how this hatred this stubborn blindness progressively corrodes and ruins an impoverished rural community in the mid1950s.  This movie is in many ways an examination of the local and deeply psychological sources of fascism not in its more historical and specific meaning but as a cultural phenomenon of the modern world.  Seth's desperate shriek for salvation amid the rays of the slowly setting sun and clouds of dust is perhaps the most powerful and unsettling scene in the film.  Yet watch closely Seth's face is not covered with tears and genuine grief!  His soul has been turned into stone  he has grown to accept the ubiquity of death and cruelty.  He will grow up to be a truly scary human being able to kill and plunder with no remorse or doubt.Great cinematographic gem.  Should be appreciated by everybody interested in challenging controversial and ambiguous art.  Profound social and even religious message about the evils of sanctimonious fundamentalism of any type of faith.".

I would only ask with regard to my possibly limited capacity if anyone knows the symbolism or whatever about the muttering identical twins that twitter up the roadespecially as I am sure it is them in the Tom Cochrane video Life Is A Highway for me this changed the inane video into an unpleasant recollection of The Reflecting Skin.  I saw this movie about 11 or 12 years ago and I still recall it as rubbish. I think it's the type of rubbish that people who find great pleasure in typical Hollywood offal I refer specifically to Scooby Doo the movie like to think is clever or artsy or whatever when in fact is a poorly piecedtogether collage of unpleasant imagery see zh84's review for more details.  This movie was utter sright down to the part when the main character watches his brother's girlfriend get into the car with the limosine perverts knowing what they are.  Arguably the boy has had bad examples set before him but my point is am I supposed to get pleasure watching this movie?  Am I supposed to learn something?  I initially watched it under the impression it was a vampire movie and I really think the nodding reference made to vampires in the movie proves flagrant false advertising of the author of the blurb I'd read.

Looking at my IMDb ID fastforwardaddict you would surmise correctly that I have no patience for lame or poorly constructed movies. I fastforward through everything that is subpar. If the writing andor the acting are bad the DVD goes right back into the Netflix or Blockbuster sleeve. Favorite movies of mine include those that are considered by such critics as Leonard Maltin to be four star rated. I say all this because when this came out in the theatres I read newspaper and magazine reviews that made it seem like a dud. Seems rather fishy now because I watched this with a male who is also very hard to please and we both liked it. At the end he said You picked a winner this time. One criticism I read was that there was no chemistry between Joseph Fiennes and Winona Ryder. First of all the movie was about Fiennes truly irritating the h... out of Ryder. Haven't you ever worked with someone who drove you nuts? Well Fiennes couldn't have played this more perfectly. I've known characters like this and he is right on the money. I also knew a character just like the one he played in Forever Mine and he was right on the money there too. His facial expressions are enough in so many instances he doesn't even have to talk. His stiff body language was absolutely suited to the character he was playing. Ryder was excellent as his coworker. Why do you think she survived her legal and public relations' problems? Because she is a very good actress. As for the chemistry between them that is subjective I sensed it.Most of the Darwin situations i.e. what the nutty victims did were priceless particularly the fellow who attached the missile to his car. The actors who played the husband and wife who were nearby made those characters very believable.The comedic writing was good. The quips between Fiennes and Ryder were great! I hardly ever watch a movie twice but I would watch this one again just to hear them go at each other and to watch with even more of my friends and relatives to share the lighthearted fun. Sarcastic but cute give and take in a conversation is not easy to write but the writers succeeded here.Fiennes's range is wide all the way from wellacted serious films such as Luther and particularly Leo to this light and happy very goodforaSaturdayafternoon provider of laughs.".

We're all familiar with the Darwin Awards a website started by Stanford molecular biologist Wendy Northcutt to humorously recognize extremely stupid acts that lead to selfinflicted accidental death.

Hence the Darwin Awards www.darwinawards.com.It sounds like a terrific premise for an outrageous comedy and like the rest of the audience I was licking my chops. Unfortunately this movie was about as funny as Origin of the Species. Director Finn Taylor has made a couple of refreshingly oddball films Dreams with the Fishes Cherish but The Darwin Awards fails on almost every level.The concept was probably doomed from the outset by the decision to incorporate a bunch of awardwinning events into a linear storyline including madcap crime investigations and a little love interest. Casting Joseph Fiennes and Wynona Ryder as the leads was the second mistake as neither of them was right for their parts and despite their efforts came off very flat. Follow that with writing that is simply not very clever and you have a disappointing movie.The vignettes do include some great casting choices including Chris Penn Tim Blake Nelson David Arquette and Metallica. But unfortunately they are lost in the woeful script and give us only the occasional funny moment.As many have heard actor Chris Penn was found dead at his Santa Monica home the day of the Sundance premiere. Finn Taylor had some nice words to say about Chris prior to the screening. And afterwards Winona Ryder who had known Chris for 15 years spoke at length about him.

In addition Chris Penn who unfortunately passed away just the day before the premiere of this film at Sundance Wilmer Valderrama Alessandro Nivola Ty Burrell Juliette Lewis Tom Hollander and David Arquette were some of the other cameos included.Joe Fiennes plays a police detective who is thrown off the squad due to his propensity to faint at the sight of blood. He and Ryder's character get together and try to find out what makes these Darwin Award winners tick. I am not sure that point is ever resolved in this film which is part of the reason why it is uneven. Also there is just no chemistry between Ryder and Fiennes. I really didn't care whether or not the two of them got together or not.There are a few laughs in the film as the Award winners demonstrate what they did to win. The problem is that they just didn't effectively sum up the movie. It was a little confusing. I will probably rent the DVD when it comes out so that I can see if I just missed it. Another problem is the documentary filmmaker who tags along. Why? He seems pointless.All in all we had a great time at the screening Fiennes Valderrama Burrell and Brad Hunt as well as Finn Taylor and the author of the book The Darwin Awards led the Q and A session afterward.

	schema:reviewBody "I was extremely disappointed by The Darwin Awards. With a stellar A list cast and great ideas behind it I had expected The Darwin Awards to be a romping comedy but every scene left me feeling more confused. Nothing meshes together and all the stories are disjointed and have little heart thrown behind them. The actors go through their lines with very little conviction. The whole production has a cheap made in my basement feel about it as if Finn Taylor had hired a bunch of school boys to do the editing and special effects.The Darwin Awards books and website has a very large collection of stories. Finn has chosen to show a few of them but hasn't woven a good story around the accidents that take place. Fiennes and Ryder play a pair of detectives investigating the accidents and a serial criminal. This is an excuse to sell a romantic comedy angle that doesn't work because there is no chemistry between the leads. Fiennes has never been a good comedian and Ryder well she has good timing but is too quirky and irksome to play a full blown woman's role yet. She still hasn't shed her childlike impish nature. The cameo actors perform much better than the leads. I can't help imagine how much better this movie would have been with a better production team and if the casting was shuffled around and David Arquette played lead. The Darwin Awards might also offend audiences who will ask themselves why should they laugh at someone's death. We just about all have lost family members through accidents and never laughed about it so why should we laugh at the deaths of unrelated people? If some people like to get off on that fine but I can't see the majority laughing. I am not surprised that the vote for this movie is being manipulated. It is so bad only desperate measures can save it. If it wasn't for these fake votes average score of 9.4 from 10 IMDb readers outside the US before Sundance and where it hasn't been released? I would have given it a higher rating. Even worse than this movie is the number of Winona Ryder fans who have tried to get rid of this review for one line of criticism.

	onyx:emotionText "I was extremely disappointed by The Darwin Awards. With a stellar A list cast and great ideas behind it I had expected The Darwin Awards to be a romping comedy but every scene left me feeling more confused. Nothing meshes together and all the stories are disjointed and have little heart thrown behind them. The actors go through their lines with very little conviction. The whole production has a cheap made in my basement feel about it as if Finn Taylor had hired a bunch of school boys to do the editing and special effects.The Darwin Awards books and website has a very large collection of stories. Finn has chosen to show a few of them but hasn't woven a good story around the accidents that take place. Fiennes and Ryder play a pair of detectives investigating the accidents and a serial criminal. This is an excuse to sell a romantic comedy angle that doesn't work because there is no chemistry between the leads. Fiennes has never been a good comedian and Ryder well she has good timing but is too quirky and irksome to play a full blown woman's role yet. She still hasn't shed her childlike impish nature. The cameo actors perform much better than the leads. I can't help imagine how much better this movie would have been with a better production team and if the casting was shuffled around and David Arquette played lead. The Darwin Awards might also offend audiences who will ask themselves why should they laugh at someone's death. We just about all have lost family members through accidents and never laughed about it so why should we laugh at the deaths of unrelated people? If some people like to get off on that fine but I can't see the majority laughing. I am not surprised that the vote for this movie is being manipulated. It is so bad only desperate measures can save it. If it wasn't for these fake votes average score of 9.4 from 10 IMDb readers outside the US before Sundance and where it hasn't been released? I would have given it a higher rating. Even worse than this movie is the number of Winona Ryder fans who have tried to get rid of this review for one line of criticism. The rest of the review reflects the same opinions as the other reviews. Freedom of speech honest opinions and quality motion pictures appear to be lower on their list of concerns than shoplifting.";

This movie was pretty simplistic...did the people who rated it that bad want this to be an indepth soul searching look into the darwin awards? Did they want more politics thrown in for more intellectual fare? Why were they bothered so? I'm really getting annoyed with how some people will tear apart a movie so voraciously you'd think the movie's creators killed their dog for something. I mean hell tear apart real fluff like wild hogs or something. So it didn't live up to your super high expectations but hell not every movie is going to move your soul. And this one was named darwin awards what did you expect??? It's like thinking the movie Idiocracy will change our education system for the better. This movie was not pee your pants funny but it was funny on par with America's funniest videos. Not going to rock your world but gives you pleasure for about 1.5 hours. Me and my husband liked it and would definitely recommend it. And not just because my fatherinlaw may someday qualify for the Darwin Awards.   So it was filmed documentary style I think it added a bit of spiceespecially when he wouldn't call 911. The love interest thing well at least we didn't get full on cheese. I don't know if anyone knows this...but anytime you travel with a good looking man or woman and they are single and you spend every waking moment with them lust or love will ALWAYS come up. That's what humans do.".

Unfortunately I've noticed that a shocking number of people were disappointed with this film.Granted Joseph Fiennes and Winona Ryder's characters being the uptight overly cautious man and the free spirited devilmaycare woman isn't a terribly original concept but I felt that it was easy to get past considering how well they played their parts. Apart from that the cast of this film features a laundry list of familiar faces including a cameo from Alex and Jamie from Mythbusters and an appearance by Metallica which as a metalhead I absolutely loved.Now for the film itself. Joseph Fiennes plays a brilliant criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department and specializes in homicides which is unfortunate for him as he has hematophobia causing him to faint at the sight of blood. He's being followed by a college student Wilmer Valderrama who is filming him for a documentary. Fiennes is soon let go from his job after fainting while trying to apprehend a suspected serial killer allowing him to escape. Afterwards he develops an interest in the Darwin Awards and goes to an insurance agency claiming he can identify these individuals with this X Factor which will save the agency millions of dollars in insurance claims. He is then paired with a claims investigator Ryder and is given four weeks to travel across the country and investigate a number of claims to prove he can do what he says he can do. The movie is filled with reenactments of actual Darwin Award cases and despite most being gruesome they're all filled with countless laughs. For some people I can see how this may not be the best of movies so it certainly helps if you have a slightly twisted sense of humor. Overall it was a fine comedy filled with a great cast excellent acting and as much laughter as there was blood. I definitely recommend you watch this film at least once if you have a couple hours to spare and in the end it has a great message. While Fiennes' character wanted to find a way to prevent these Darwin cases he realizes he can't save the world and learns the one ultimate truth of the universe Sht happens...".

Joseph Fiennes is much better here than he was on Flash Forward. At least here he laughs and shows some human emotions. Winona Ryder gives wonderful support as usual.There are lots of stars here but unfortunately there parts are only four or five minutes each. It is nice to see people like Nora Dunn and Juliet Lewis who don't work enough these days.Sadly this was Chris Penn's last major film. He accidentally died of a massive heart attack brought on by drugs like cocaine and overeating steaks and chocolate milk shakes at the rather young age of 40. It is quite ironic that his last major work should be a film about the stupid ways that people die. Not to be cruel as Penn was a wonderful actor but his death could be added quite easily to the five or six ridiculous deaths and accidents that the movie chronicles.My favorite scene in the movie is the one at the Metallica concert. I have a feeling that Heavy Metal music fans often win Darwin Awards awards for bizarre and stupid deaths.There's a good selection of popular songs on the soundtrack.If you don't expect too much in the way of coherence and can get into the silly spirit of the film it can be enjoyable.Incidentally you should keep watching to the end of the credits for one last joke at the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "A cornucopia of what I call folding.Here is the setup we have our standard inner representative a detective. He is obsessed with understanding the world so as to understand the Darwin Effect people who do stuff so dumb they kill themselves thereby taking themselves out of the gene pool. In basic shape it is the standard noir form.As the story proceeds he becomes himself one of these folk providing some amusing episodes. By my count that is two folds. Along the way he is accompanied by a woman part buddy part love interest and part persontoexplainto.Not content to stop there this filmmaker piles it on and on.The thing is framed as a documentary. There is a film student making his thesis film by following our hero. He is acknowledged frequently but at the end the film slides into the disembodied camera we are used to seeing outside of the story. We often have the situation of the film we see that has the camera within it watching our guy watch things on the web.The detective has a second obsession to catch a serial killer loose in San Francisco. This folds in an entirely different direction. The killer is a frustrated beat poet so has confabulated a life as killer writing on his acts. This actually makes sense. We have Lawrence Ferlinghetti appearing on screen as part of the detecting! The motive of the killer is teased out from a beat philosophy in an amazingly literate way.But the folding doesn't even stop there!Some of these Darwin Award episodes are possible urban legends a key attraction of the Darwin awards website is that they verify from news accounts that the episodes really happened. A TeeVee show mythbusters checks others in dramatic ways to see if they were physically possible. The mythbusters hosts appear here as characters.One final neat fold. Our detective has a theory that the Darwin award candidates are that way because they are second children and that they are trying to better their older sibling. This is elaborated a bit as the award candidates are proposed not as merely lethally stupid but as living life to the fullest. There is an earnestness in the second child syndrome that the actor playing our detective has. He actually gets this across.But he is played by a man who has a much more successful older brother. A surprising number of the other important characters are also played by actors in an identical situation. Its pretty cool but has been overlooked and not mentioned in any remarks I have read on this film.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	onyx:emotionText "A cornucopia of what I call folding.Here is the setup we have our standard inner representative a detective. He is obsessed with understanding the world so as to understand the Darwin Effect people who do stuff so dumb they kill themselves thereby taking themselves out of the gene pool. In basic shape it is the standard noir form.As the story proceeds he becomes himself one of these folk providing some amusing episodes. By my count that is two folds. Along the way he is accompanied by a woman part buddy part love interest and part persontoexplainto.Not content to stop there this filmmaker piles it on and on.The thing is framed as a documentary. There is a film student making his thesis film by following our hero. He is acknowledged frequently but at the end the film slides into the disembodied camera we are used to seeing outside of the story. We often have the situation of the film we see that has the camera within it watching our guy watch things on the web.The detective has a second obsession to catch a serial killer loose in San Francisco. This folds in an entirely different direction. The killer is a frustrated beat poet so has confabulated a life as killer writing on his acts. This actually makes sense. We have Lawrence Ferlinghetti appearing on screen as part of the detecting! The motive of the killer is teased out from a beat philosophy in an amazingly literate way.But the folding doesn't even stop there!Some of these Darwin Award episodes are possible urban legends a key attraction of the Darwin awards website is that they verify from news accounts that the episodes really happened. A TeeVee show mythbusters checks others in dramatic ways to see if they were physically possible. The mythbusters hosts appear here as characters.One final neat fold.

This film was responsible for keeping the company a float during this time period and it also marked a turning point in the company's history. For years Lloyd Kaufman and company were making cheesy sex comedies. With the birth of the Toxic Avenger they started to expand their horizons focusing on low budget horrorcomedy trashy spoofs films. Instant cult classics were being produced by Team Troma. The Toxic Avenger is a Charles Atlas tale gone a wry. A weak nerd is transformed into a superhero of superhuman size and strength. Melvin Junko is his name. Melvin was a mop boy for a local health spa. One day when a mean prank turned into a horrible accident he was exposed to an open drum of toxic waste. That unfortunate mishap transforms and mutates Melvin into an avenger a TOXIC AVENGER. Troma becomes a worldwide phenomenon and the Toxic Avenger becomes one of the most famous cult films of all time. A must for all campy cult film fans!!Highly recommended!".

Though it's a typical Bmovie the premise is creative and I actually felt sympathy for the character of Melvin before his mutation.  I know what it's like to be the underdog so I was able to somewhat relate to him.  So while some may have laughed at his quirky antics I was too busy feeling sympathy for pool little Melvin.  The film is filled with quirky lowbrow humor which often works.  I just felt that the premise wore thin after a while and that's when the film seemed to simply go through the motions.  Despite that I had a good time and can understand why this is the film that put Troma on the map.  So if you're in the mood for a funny lowbudget lowbrow horrorcomedy then please check out The Toxic Avenger. My score  6 out of 10".

Meanwhile Toxie eventually finds romance with a blind woman who is unaware her boyfriend is responsible for the recent wave of gruesome vigilante killings in essence they're the perfect couple.A sick and depraved sense of humor is flaunted throughout this lowbudget film project which is in itself to the politicallycorrect an inspired meanspirited overtly racist funny and completely utterly insane cult flick that also reveals a slight penchant for animal cruelty.The acting is atrocious the gore is plentiful and the low budget shines but there's no question I loved this flick.

Some people mistake targeted parody for poor acting. No way. I'm not saying it's an A Hollywood rubbish colossal yet during the first part of the movie  the mop man weakling made fun of  you clearly see facial expression mimicks etc are over the top  purposefully so.This movie has scenes that are copied borrowed or else identical in super budget A later movies. Ex when the mop man bathes into toxic waste Joker from Batman movies anybody? Ex when the monster hijacks a car with two villains killing one and riding the other at full speed to his death the crow anyone? And when the car finally explodes  the monster is unarmed Terminator anyone?The blind girl  Maranda is very very pretty  affair reminds of Ben the rock man from the fantastic 4 in some comics.the scene where the slutty bimbo teases the mopman to wear a ridiculous outfit to arouse her only to trick him in front of a sheep with bra in front of everybody so he runs away in shame with all the overly exaggerated gestures is a clear parody of many culprit trauma scenes from more famous movies.The moral is all those glossy  fancy morons poking fun at the nerdy mopman are in reality drug addicts weirdos killers hitrun drivers pimps pushers etc so in reality the pathetic mopman  the ugly monster are much better than those scumbags.There is gore but not much  anyways not enough to bother an adult. There are a few girls who'd belong to a porn flick a sauna masturbation scene  the monster has sex too but overall it isn't more graphic than most cable TV crime movie i'd say less.There is violence bar none two weirdos cane an old lady to death a dog is shot  the blind bimbo is almost raped clockwork orange spoof .There is also parody of more conventional items in superhero movies. Ex Batman hides in the bat caves Superman in the north pole Fortress and the monster hides in a junkyard. When he gets the blues for being sick of mashing criminals he  his girlfriend go hide in his favourite place another dump. There you get a camping tent  she's in bikini.The monster roars  that's clearly an incredible Hulk spoof. To rescue hostages in a fast food the monster faces criminals who are themselves a parody of the bad bunch an horny Negro a paintedface punk white and a third slick dressed white who faces the monster with some agility martial arts moves etc. Again parody of a bunch of clichs.The monster helps oldies cross the street helps housewives open cookie jars fun poked at conventional superheroesI liked this movie very much. It's a spoof it's a comedy. You can't expect Orson Wells and Kenneth Branagh yet the acting is not so poor as let believe. Watch it.".

I like pollution and go out of my way to pollute the planet so I wasn't sure whether or not this lowbudget comedy would have some underlying hippie environmental garbage message or not. Nevertheless I decided to buy it... Oh my god it was hilarious! Melvin is a lonely awkward ugly geek working as a janitor in the local health club in Tromaville known as the toxic chemical capital of the world. During a harmless if not somewhat cruel prank on Melvin he gets into an unexpected accident involving hazardous waste and hurries terrified back to his mom's house where he mutates. Unsure if he can survive in society he lives in the garbage dump on the outskirts of town... but it isn't long before he dons his mop and literally cleans up the town getting rid of psychos perverts pedophiles drug dealers and corrupt cops. He also falls for a very nice girl Sara who happens to be blind and can't see his mutated appearance.Aside from the constant crude humor which I found annoying and rude The Toxic Avenger is a comedic movie you just can't hate. From the catchy 80's soundtrack to the weird sheep kiss prank played on Melvin the acting the gore effects the very original idea this is a movie you won't want to avoid! I don't recommend you let your kids watch it there are a few disturbing scenes some violence sex jokes nudity a couple of racisthomophobic comments and a rather misleading and stereotypical portrayal of the blind girl. Adults can enjoy the film while knowing better than to say these things but kids could easily pick up various phrases from the film. A children's version of the film Toxic Crusaders is the better thing to show your kids.I don't know if I'll be watching this film again but I'm certainly going to view the others in the series! If you want something comedic actionpacked lowbudget and original you'll love this.".

He also falls for a very nice girl Sara who happens to be blind and can't see his mutated appearance.Aside from the constant crude humor which I found annoying and rude The Toxic Avenger is a comedic movie you just can't hate. From the catchy 80's soundtrack to the weird sheep kiss prank played on Melvin the acting the gore effects the very original idea this is a movie you won't want to avoid! I don't recommend you let your kids watch it there are a few disturbing scenes some violence sex jokes nudity a couple of racisthomophobic comments and a rather misleading and stereotypical portrayal of the blind girl. Adults can enjoy the film while knowing better than to say these things but kids could easily pick up various phrases from the film. A children's version of the film Toxic Crusaders is the better thing to show your kids.I don't know if I'll be watching this film again but I'm certainly going to view the others in the series! If you want something comedic actionpacked lowbudget and original you'll love this.";

It has great make up and Gore effects and there is plenty of laughs plus it features plenty of hilarious villains!. I admit i love Troma films and coming into this i had high expectations and i wasn't disappointed as it delivered everything i wanted gorelaughs cool characters and a cool story!. If your looking for great acting look elsewhere but if your looking for an extremely fun cheese fest with plenty of gore and lots of laughs you have come to the right place as this film has plenty of that!. This is an awesome cult classic that's extremely enjoyablewith a fun cast and i say it's a must see especially for Troma lovers like me!. The Direction is great!.

The Acting is actually not too bad for a Troma filmstill bad though but it's a lot of fun!. Mitch Cohen is awesome as the Toxic Avenger he had some great one liners was a lot of fun to watch had awesome chemistry with Andree Marandaand kicked that ass!. Andree Maranda is hot and was great as the blind girlfriend i liked her lots. Cindy Manion is pretty good looking and plays the slut well however her acting needs a lot of work!. Gary Schneider is a terrible actor however his performance is amusing as Bozo and cracked me up a couple times. Mark Torgl is amusing as Melvin the nerd and did fine.

Is The Toxic Avenger a social comment on the narcissistic and materialistic and bigotry ways of Western society or just a plain horror movie parody reflecting on how society should be more tolerant to difference? This is the story of Melvin the Tromaville Health Club mop boy who inadvertently and naively trusts the hedonistic contemptuous and vain health club members to the point of accidentally ending up in a vat of toxic waste.

The local mop boy is now the local Superhero the saviour of corruption thuggish bullies and indifference.There has been a lot of hard work put into these movies special effects for a movie of this genre it has worked very well. With the extremely visual talents of Jennifer Aspinall she has made this movie virtually her own her numerous Award winning flair on special makeup effects is astounding. There is also her movie pedigree to reflect on too such as Spookies 1987 Street Trash 1987 the Saturday Night Live and Mad TV television shows The Mexican 2001 Ticker 2001 and A Cinderella Story 2004 and others.Apart from the well thought out stunt fights car chases clever make up and witty script The Toxic Avenger is down to base level a very funny movie this has no doubt been used as a stepping stone to greater things for some here.

	schema:reviewBody "This Troma film a piece of symphatetic and not uninteresting trash by veterans Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz THE TOXIC AVENGER USA 1985 turned out to be even funnier and genuinely more clever little film as I rewatched it last night on the wonderful Tox Box DVD set released by Troma including all three films in director's cut versions!First of all I admire the speed the directors manage to maintain throughout the film minutes just pass by without even thinking about it which is definitely not always the case with B films. The characters are very noisy and irritating most of the time but that fits to the own world of the film the Tromaville and thus doesn't feel annoying anymore. I think this is something many other trash films have never achieved for example the awful 2002 film THE HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES by musician Rob Zombie whose film tries to be funny the characters laugh at their own jokes all the time etc. but doesn't manage to create an interesting or original world of its own at all  and that's why the idiotic characters and neverending talkingscreaming starts to feel very irritating. Unlike THE TOXIC AVENGER Zombie's film leaves nothing to the viewer's brain.Especially like the German expressionist piece and cinematically breathtaking achievement DAS CABINET DES DR. CALIGARI by Robert Wiene the Troma film has created a wild and wonderful world in which the unusually wild and excessively behaving and reacting face expressions and other representations of one's feelings characters fit perfectly. Also THE TOXIC AVENGER has some satiric elements in it mostly towards the youth in general with its desperate searches for a stronger identity usually at the expense of the weaker and uglier. The actors are all great. The scene in which a mother of some brat is washed in a very unusual manner strenghtens the mentioned interpretation about the youth even more. The film manages to point out some errors and negative sides of the society with black humor and dares also to show the flag in a little different and more realistic as any other flag on Earth light than for example Michael Bay which is great too.Of course the film is also full of sex women's breasts and ultra violence not to speak of awful editing and continuity errors but they kind of add to the unique and overenergetic world of the film. The best thing here is that the makers knew what they were doing  outrageous trash  they knew that the film won't be appreciated by the Academy for example but they also knew that despite those facts and authorities their film can have many themes and ideas even more than those that get golden statues.My greetings to the lunatics at Tromaville!".

It's almost like being transported to another world where concepts such as normal logic and intelligence cease to exist a world where the on screen elements are reminiscent of soft porn where the point is sex and everything in the plot bows to meet that in Toxic Avenger they add gore into the formula and downplay the sex. The funny thing is Toxic Avenger's characters and performances are so far out there it almost succeeds in taking you to that corny world of bhorror where such crap is acceptable. A world where films like the North by NorthWests and Lost in Translations don't exist. Yes Toxic Avenger almost succeeds . . . almost. Or perhaps I've seen too many bad lowbudget films in the last few weeks that I'm just starting to accept it? Who knows. With the exception of the occasional punch lines the only aspect of Toxic Avenger that held my interest and kept me watching was the violence as sick as that sounds  the fact that it does not back down and shy away from real possibilities of children or animals getting hurt impressed me immensely. I've seen too many studio horroraction flicks that are politically correct and does not offend the masses studio films who are insultingly predictable because of testing with the wrong audience. Thank you Troma for following through and having some backbone. Thank you for killing animals children and beating up old ladies.".

The fight scenes are pretty cool like the scene in the Taco Resteraunt that had some neat fighting moves. Some scenes did show the same scenes over again to pad the film up but that isn't too bad since they don't drag for too long.The make up for The Toxic Avenger is good and the effects for the gore are cool. The Toxic Avenger is one of those cult classic's that must be seen for some humour horror nudity and gore. Check this out.".

He then transforms into The Toxic Avenger where he endeavours to fight crime and bring justice to Tromaville. Lloyd Kaufman got the idea of setting a horror movie at a health club when he was working as a preproduction supervisor for Rocky. He then set out with his friend Michael Herz to make the movie under the name 'Health Club'. This later developed into what we now know as 'The Toxic Avenger'.The Toxic Avenger is one of those bmovies that is so well done in its execution that you can't help but love it. From the outrageous and over exaggerated performances to its tongue and cheek writing to its extreme graphic violence it's got everything you want from a movie of this kind. It's selfaware of its outrageous premise and has fun with it by satirising eighties culture and pushing the limits of controversial content. It spawned a plethora of sequels and spin offs even infamously a Saturday morning cartoon for kids which also resulted in toys and other merchandise. However the original The Toxic Avenger is NOT for kids. It has sex swearing drugs and violence that I can imagine many parents at the time were shocked to find out if they didn't look at the R rating on the cover of the VHS. The Toxic Avenger is an entertaining and hysterically funny film that I recommend to fans of superhero comedies.".

The characters are exaggerated to the point of becoming a reallife cartoon. Mark Torgl's facial expressions alone will brand themselves into your permanent memory. But this overthetop hilarity is balanced by their ability to really make you feel their inner pain. The director Lloyd Kaufman also creates moments of true desolation while somehow keeping it funny. Somehow he gets you to feel sorry while laughing at the misfortune of those poor bastards.What makes this movie great is that anything goes but it doesn't toss out everything else expected original dialogue competent actors and cohesive story. The only thing this movie lacked was better film quality. The lack of funds are definitely apparent camera department. But with an astronomically low budget 475000 these film makers should be commended for making Toxic Avenger cult classic.".

The Toxic Avenger's humor is definitely not for everybody but if you're from Jersey you are hereby required to rent it at least once. On a side note Joe Zarro who appears in this film as the proprietor of the dry cleaner's shop taught English and Film Studies at Paramus High School in the late 1980s. His star turn in Toxic Avenger was widely known among the student body yet he seemed somewhat embarrassed by it and naturally he wouldn't even consider screening it for our class. What a shame!!".

	schema:reviewBody "With Vnus noireAbdellatif Kechiche tells the story of Sarah Baartman an African born from the Khoisan Tribe who was a slave of a Dutch farmer. She went with the brother of her slave owner on an Exhibition a Freak Tour in England with the promise of a wealthy future. Then Sarah Baartman was sold to a Frenchman who took her to his country. An animal trainer Raux exhibited her under more pressured conditions for fifteen months. Overall Sarah Baartman was exhibited around Britain and France from 1810 to 1815 entertaining people by exposing her nude buttocks and her highly unusual bodily features. She had large buttocks and the elongated labia of some Khoisan women. Towards the end of her life she became the subject of several scientific paintings at the Jardin du Roi where she was examined in March 1815 by George Cuvier head keeper of the menagerie at the muse national d'Histoire naturelle. Seek and forgotten by the Parisians she began to drink heavily and supported herself with prostitution in brothel and then in the streets. She died of an undetermined inflammatory ailment on December 29 1815. Even after her Death her body continued to be exploited by others and her skeleton preserved genitals and brain were placed on display in Paris' muse de l'Homme until 1974. In 1994 President Nelson Mandela formally requested that France return the remains and it's only in 2002 May the 6th that her remains were repatriated to her homeland and were buried on August 9 of the same year.Obviously this dramatic and terrible story is not for everyone and I strongly suggest the most emotionally fragile people among us to read about the Sarah Baartman's story instead of watching Abdellatif Kechiche's film. Vnus noire remains an interesting film as Sarah Baartman's story is to be told so that we understand how Difference the fear of it the non understanding of it can trigger the most inhuman sentiment which lies in the darkest place of our soul in one word Racism. However in 2 hours and 40 minutes Abdellatif Kechiche abuses the audience with too many despicable scenes too many scenes of dehumanization and degradation. So many that you find yourself in a overdose state. At some point I wanted to leave the Theater. I didn't pay to look but Abdellatif Kechiche places the audience in a voyeurism sit that makes you so uncomfortable your eyes flee the screen searching for the blackness of the Theater room. Even if there is a reason for us to be gradually placed within different environments so we understand that racism isn't bound to a Country or a social class it is still very tough to keep absorbing shocking images on a continuous basis. We are transported from the vulgar and popular crowd of London to the vicious and decadent Bourgeoisie of Paris and eventually to a so called scientific experiment. One can easily draw the conclusion that whatever form of Racism we are confronted to none of them is humanly or intellectually acceptable. In fact all of them are profoundly revolting.Beside its heavy content and shocking scenes that for sure will polarize the audience the film is also served with an outstanding cast. The main actress Yahima Torres is very convincing in a very difficult role. But all actors Andre Jacobs Olivier Gourmet display skills in their respective interpretation skills that trigger emotions we hate we curse we're ashamed we're shocked and we're upset during 2h40 of cinematic maelstrom.".

	onyx:emotionText "With Vnus noireAbdellatif Kechiche tells the story of Sarah Baartman an African born from the Khoisan Tribe who was a slave of a Dutch farmer. She went with the brother of her slave owner on an Exhibition a Freak Tour in England with the promise of a wealthy future. Then Sarah Baartman was sold to a Frenchman who took her to his country. An animal trainer Raux exhibited her under more pressured conditions for fifteen months. Overall Sarah Baartman was exhibited around Britain and France from 1810 to 1815 entertaining people by exposing her nude buttocks and her highly unusual bodily features. She had large buttocks and the elongated labia of some Khoisan women. Towards the end of her life she became the subject of several scientific paintings at the Jardin du Roi where she was examined in March 1815 by George Cuvier head keeper of the menagerie at the muse national d'Histoire naturelle. Seek and forgotten by the Parisians she began to drink heavily and supported herself with prostitution in brothel and then in the streets. She died of an undetermined inflammatory ailment on December 29 1815. Even after her Death her body continued to be exploited by others and her skeleton preserved genitals and brain were placed on display in Paris' muse de l'Homme until 1974. In 1994 President Nelson Mandela formally requested that France return the remains and it's only in 2002 May the 6th that her remains were repatriated to her homeland and were buried on August 9 of the same year.Obviously this dramatic and terrible story is not for everyone and I strongly suggest the most emotionally fragile people among us to read about the Sarah Baartman's story instead of watching Abdellatif Kechiche's film. Vnus noire remains an interesting film as Sarah Baartman's story is to be told so that we understand how Difference the fear of it the non understanding of it can trigger the most inhuman sentiment which lies in the darkest place of our soul in one word Racism. However in 2 hours and 40 minutes Abdellatif Kechiche abuses the audience with too many despicable scenes too many scenes of dehumanization and degradation. So many that you find yourself in a overdose state. At some point I wanted to leave the Theater. I didn't pay to look but Abdellatif Kechiche places the audience in a voyeurism sit that makes you so uncomfortable your eyes flee the screen searching for the blackness of the Theater room. Even if there is a reason for us to be gradually placed within different environments so we understand that racism isn't bound to a Country or a social class it is still very tough to keep absorbing shocking images on a continuous basis. We are transported from the vulgar and popular crowd of London to the vicious and decadent Bourgeoisie of Paris and eventually to a so called scientific experiment. One can easily draw the conclusion that whatever form of Racism we are confronted to none of them is humanly or intellectually acceptable. In fact all of them are profoundly revolting.Beside its heavy content and shocking scenes that for sure will polarize the audience the film is also served with an outstanding cast. The main actress Yahima Torres is very convincing in a very difficult role. But all actors Andre Jacobs Olivier Gourmet display skills in their respective interpretation skills that trigger emotions we hate we curse we're ashamed we're shocked and we're upset during 2h40 of cinematic maelstrom.";

	schema:reviewBody "I finally watched this movie earlier today with a sorrowful heart after first hearing about it a couple of years ago. hard to get it here in Indonesia on DVD finally got it on two split You Tube downloads.Yes this is not a film for the faint hearted it is extremely graphic and harsh in its direction to say the least and certainly long at 2 hours 40 minutes comparable with the Hobbit which I saw on new Years Eve.The film is an artistic portrayal of a dignified South African tribal woman who is abused and misled once she arrives first to England and then later to Paris. However it lacks artistic direction and balance. Not a contradiction in terms exactly.for example the opening scene shows her being exhibited in a medical seminar and the end of the movie displays her physical remains which would later be put in a Paris Musueum. My point is that the Director could have taken more attention to detail and put the lady into a greater prospective perhaps a prequel to the main part of the story the recent Johnny Depp movie 'Dark shadows a case in point showing the lady in her tribal land and how she met the Doctor before arriving to England. The explanation in the movie is all too bland and passed over for the most part. The same applied for the ending although there were some explanatory subtitles and compensating visual glimpses of when she was returned to South Africa.What we see in this film is no different from what still goes on in our world today but in a different way. We goglobal in order to see the very thing that this humble woman was subjected to and we pay to see it sometimes on the internet  animals as well as humans  and it is only perhaps in western countries that there are antivoice against the abuse in circuses.We should watch this film and want to be shocked. Unlike the spectators shown throughout the film we have the benefit of a greater education and enhanced knowledge but abuse such as Saartje Baartman is shown to endure in the movie goes on to this day.There was a lack of cohesion at times in the transition from going London to Paris and then later when Saartje found herself in the Brothels. Yes she drank and smoked and was inevitably sensitive and temperamental given her real life role play but this is indeed an extraordinary film about an extraordinary woman who is extraordinary for her courage and determination and not so unordinary from any other woman except for her buttocks and her labia according to the medical scientists.I certainly enjoyed this film more than the Hobbit' which bored the pants off me except for the special effects and yes 'Venus Noire' is slow and often repetitive but I can share empathy with the Director and in an unkind cruel uncomfortable way this is entertainment.On a general note there is no swearing or offensive violence despite the harsh treatment Saartje Baartman endured while away from South Africa. Yes she is mostly naked for large sections of the film and there are a couple of later scenes in Paris where she is in a sexual situation but apart from that this is not a film for a sexual voyeur and don't expect to see flashes of an unusually large labia because you will not.The standard of acting in this film is excellent. I may be wrong here but this is a French film and so good subtitles in English or language of your choice are important. I suggest that there are a lot of other movies out there who will shock and offend you a whole lot more than this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before start I need to say that the cast is great especially Yahima Torres as the title character. Its an Oscar worthy performance unfortunately it's buried in a film that is abusive to its audience as it is to the title character.I saw this at the first screening at the NYFF and when it was over the audience around me wanted to find and kill the director. The audience was subdued or rather the audience that remained was subdued and was mumbling about what would have made the film better...This is the story of Saartjie 'Sarah' Baartman best known as the Hottentot Venus a woman of unique proportions who was exhibited all over Europe and died a tragic death. The film is told in flashback and starts with a lecture where her body parts are exhibited and then flashes back to her days in London before taking us all the way back to her dissection. Its a warts and all look at the abuse she suffered in her life.Nasty unpleasant unending film that is nothing but a repetitive catalog of the abuses that Baartman suffered in her life. It goes on and an on as she's abused in shows by scientists in sex shows in brothels and as a streetwalker. There is no light no character only abuse.The idea is that we are suppose to be made to feel complicit in the abuse and we are supposed to feel something but after almost three hours of GRAPHIC abuse wears you down. You go numb and if you were part of the audience at Alice Tully Hall you want to find the director and hit him.While I wasn't driven to homicidal thoughts I was bored after a certain part and by the time she's cut up and put into jars I didn't much care.On the other hand the news footage that plays during the end credits of her remains being returned to South Africa brought me to tears but it would have done so even if I hadn't been abused for three hours.Honestly the director makes his point after ten minutes and doesn't need two hours and a half hour more to repeat the point. By doing so he loses the argument and the audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "The last movie i saw at this years NY Film Fest was Black Venus. As flawed as this movie may have been at the end of the day it was a step forward in black film if there even is such a thing. For once i didn't have to sit through a movie about the first black athlete to slam dunk a basketball at an ivy league school a single teen mother in the ghetto yes I'm taking a stab at precious and the hundred other movies to focus on that an aspiring rapping pimp hustle n' flow a black sidekick that has some stupid loyalty to the white main character a role kept alive by Morgan Freeman and Whoopi Goldberg or a biography about a predictable civil rights leader. Black Venus Tells the story of Saartjie Baartman aka Hottentot Venus a young women from Cape Town who was shown as a freak in a traveling carnival in Europe during the 1800's due to her curvy physique something Europeans had not yet seen. In her short life not only was she exhibited and groped at in a freak show but she was used as entertainment in private sex parties studied by scientists like an object and even had to work as prostitute in order to make money. Even though this was Yamiha Torres's first time acting she gave a performance reminiscent of Charlotte Gainsbourg in Antichrist or even Isabella Rossellini in Blue Velvet. I make those comparisons because each of those actresses had to let their guard down and really stretch as actresses almost to the point where you kinda feel embarrassed for them at certain points in the movie. Naturally Black Venus will draw comparison to a movie like The Elephant Man or even Todd Browning's Freaks not to say that either Saartjie Baartman or John Merrick were freaks. Black Venus had the natural feel of director Abdellatif Kechiche's other movies like Secret of The Grain which i appreciated. This film only had one flaw but as far as I'm concerned it was a MAJOR one. The editing. Jesus Christ this movie could've been cut down quite a bit. I thought there were WAY too many scenes that focused on her being shown as a freak and hardly no focus on the main characters back story outside of a few references here and there. Even more the scenes where she is paraded around like a sideshow went on for way too long to the point where you want to scream ALRIGHT ENOUGH! WE GET IT! The last half of the movie in particular has its share of scenes that are very difficult to watch. Black Venus is a lot to take in and its still stuck in my head. So even though the movie lacked some serious editing it obviously succeeded in that the images are still stuck in my head and i cant stop thinking about it. The ending sequence during the credits draws comparison to another David Lynch film Inland Empire. Both Black Venus and Inland Empire are very intense and take a lot out of you but both movies have an ending sequence that put you at ease. In Black Venus the movie ends with actual news footage of Saartjie Baartman's remains being shipped back to South Africa after years of ironically being exhibited in a french museum. This one of few scenes in the movie that out you at ease.".

Spoilers beyond this point The movie starts of with the bodycast of our black Venus and her genitalia in a jar which is passed around while we are shown detailed drawings of her vagina. Seriously WTF After that the movie tries to shock us again by showing us the performance black Venus has to do on stage. While you get it after 1 minute yes she's in a cage yes its demeaning yes it's wrong the director chooses to show it's entire length. This was the first time I checked my watch OMG only 35 minutes in an already bored?What follows is more or less a howto guide in how NOT to get the audience emotionally involved with your characters. Black Venus gets the chance to make a stance at a hearing in court about what's going on claims it's her free will to participate she's an actress yadadada. OK cool good for you Venus while after seeing the stage show for the millionth time and enduring another round of shockfire from the misguided director the movie becomes unbearable and is just as hard on you as it is on Venus. The movie drags on for a good 15 hours after this point. OK WE GET IT SHE IS NT HAPPY. AAARGH!!!!I feel almost ashamed to say this but I only felt relieve when she finally dropped dead in the movie cause we knew it was almost over.Horrible horrible horrible drag of a film and it's up with the worst of the worst in my book.Definite NO GOBe warned!!".

There are many scenes that show Ms. Baartman being abused on public display in many different venues even when we as an audience have already gotten the point about how disgusting her abuse was. My friend and I walked out on the movie toward the end. We were trying to stick around for the Q  A but the movie eventually got so disgusting we couldn't watch any more. We saw droves of people sexually abuse this woman for a long period of time to the point where we couldn't endure this garbage any longer.Also let me add if you yourself have been sexuallyphysically abused you definitely don't want to watch this film.

	schema:reviewBody "A doctor introduces the audience to what is about to unfold before our eyes on the screen. It is a lecture about an unusual woman who puzzled the scientists of the early XIX century. The subject of the study was a South African native Saartjie Baartman a woman of humble origins working as a domestic help in the home of Hendrick Caezar an opportunist who realizes the potential in exploiting Saartjie to unsuspecting European audiences whose appetite for that type of freak shows proved to be a source of making money at the expense of the unfortunate woman.Another member of that circuit the bear tamer Reaux realizes the gold mine his friend has. Reaux manages to get Saartjie for his own exploitation. He devises a scheme where he pushes Saartjie into exhibiting her as a freak show for the corrupt higher classes of France of that time. The bored high society saw in Saartjie an opportunity to satisfy their own perversity and abnormal sex desires heightened by the presence of the exotic woman who is made to be the object of their fantasies. Ultimately Saartjie resorts to prostitution dying in miserable conditions. The ultimate desecration of this woman occurred as Reaux finally sells her body to the medical investigators Saartjie did not want to have them examine her most intimate parts.Black Venus conceived and directed by Abdellatif Kechiche the recent winner of best picture at Cannes 2013. The film is a documentary about the tragic life of a woman that attracted attention from people that exploited the physical attributes which she a rarity for an ignorant public came to see as an aberration as well as a sexual fantasy. M. Kechiche cowrote the screenplay with Ghalia Lacroix. It is based on the real story of the South African woman who finally was recognized as a victim of those who used her for their own benefit getting rich by selling her as the wild animal she was not. The acting is one of the best things going for the film. Unfortunately the central figure of Saartjie as played by Yahima Torres who appears to be a non professional actress shows only a limited range of emotions keeping her one expression with the exception of her real tears throughout the film. It probably is unfair to Ms. Torres but she was in the company of more experienced professionals like the excellent Olivier Gourmet who as Reaux is the best thing in the picture. Theactor keeps surprising with every new appearance. Andre Jacobs as Fredrick Caezar manages to convey his hideous nature as the exploiter of the unfortunate woman. Elina Lowensohn makes an impression as Jeanne the only kind soul Saartjie met in her life.Director Kechiche shows incredible talent and it is apparent he will be a force to be reckoned with in his future endeavors. The cinematographer Ludomir Bakchev captures the mood of the period in which the action takes place.".

The ultimate desecration of this woman occurred as Reaux finally sells her body to the medical investigators Saartjie did not want to have them examine her most intimate parts.Black Venus conceived and directed by Abdellatif Kechiche the recent winner of best picture at Cannes 2013. The film is a documentary about the tragic life of a woman that attracted attention from people that exploited the physical attributes which she a rarity for an ignorant public came to see as an aberration as well as a sexual fantasy. M. Kechiche cowrote the screenplay with Ghalia Lacroix. It is based on the real story of the South African woman who finally was recognized as a victim of those who used her for their own benefit getting rich by selling her as the wild animal she was not. The acting is one of the best things going for the film. Unfortunately the central figure of Saartjie as played by Yahima Torres who appears to be a non professional actress shows only a limited range of emotions keeping her one expression with the exception of her real tears throughout the film. It probably is unfair to Ms. Torres but she was in the company of more experienced professionals like the excellent Olivier Gourmet who as Reaux is the best thing in the picture. Theactor keeps surprising with every new appearance. Andre Jacobs as Fredrick Caezar manages to convey his hideous nature as the exploiter of the unfortunate woman. Elina Lowensohn makes an impression as Jeanne the only kind soul Saartjie met in her life.Director Kechiche shows incredible talent and it is apparent he will be a force to be reckoned with in his future endeavors. The cinematographer Ludomir Bakchev captures the mood of the period in which the action takes place.";

The DVD was behind the counter at the library for good reason I discovered. I had to turn the DVD machine off several times. I kept hoping somehow fortunes would change for her or at least some revenge. The movie was simultaneously degrading for the character and for the actor Yahima Torres who played Saartjie Baartman. I could not believe a modern actress would willing play such a degrading role. She must have been tricked or bullied into it. It is one of the most depressing movies ever made. It leaves you feeling filthy to the core. It is a soft porn movie but it is much dirtier and disgusting than any hardcore porn movie you would have seen.".

It opens with a grotesque scientific convention scene where a group of physicians inspect the genitals of a woman preserved in a formaldehyde filled jar accompanied with a long boring technical monologue which is aimed to reflect the scientific viewpoints of its time. Then it is mired into an endless series of abuse scenes which get worse before the movie transforms into some kind of hard porn. The subject matter would certainly be a great story in the hands of a talented director but in this case there's no storytelling and the director simply makes the audience witness her sufferings in real time with repetitive freak show scenes which follow one after another and drag on until the audience is bored to death. One final word about the lead actress Yahima Torres. Throughout her ordeal she simply looks bored rather than disturbed and agonized with no reaction to her abusers. With blank stares she smokes drinks and follows what she's told to do. From the trivia I understand she was simply picked up from the street for this role without any preceding professional career. Her inexperience could be the reason why she was so submissive to director's strange style otherwise it's difficult to imagine any selfrespecting actress would go along with such a bizarre scenario. What a sad start for a career and what a sorry piece of junk for such a great and promising material.".

Paige effectively blends humor with the contemplation of serious issues as exhibited by both laughter and tears of the audience.Paige's character Paul functions with the naive perceptions of a child among adults. Najimy's character shows her own naivity when she forms different assumptions about Paul during the course of the movie and subsequently targets him. Najimy portrays an sympathetic antagonist. It was easy to laugh at her character become disgusted and yet feel sorry for her because she embodied what we often see in society.This is one of those movies that had me thinking about it long after I left the theater. I found myself contemplating my own thoughts and feelings regarding the issues presented and societal expectations. I do hope that Paige is able to find a distributor for this film so that it may be seen and recognized by a larger audience.".

It's this confusion and the homophobic panic that can arise from it that Peter Paige has on his mind in his directorial debut Say Uncle.Paul Johnson Paige is a completely selfabsorbed cubicle slave. His world revolves around his godson Morgan with light romantic and artistic interests on the periphery.

After finding the new tenants Gabrielle Union  Marc Anthony Samuel in Sarah's old house to be less accommodating about him letting himself in Peter tries to find a new direction in his life. The answer becomes obvious to Peter find other kids to play with.That some folks find a lone weirdo male showing up at parks to play with kids a little disturbing isn't too surprising. One mother Maggie Kathy Najimy is so frightened by Paul that she starts a public campaign to have him arrested before he victimizes one of the children in the community. She first tries the police but she is brushed off as a lunatic appropriately. Saying that We need our 'Just Say No' Kathy rouses some other parents to the cause. This all leads to rumors galore and very public accusations.The problems with this film are largely unrelated to its technical aspects. It's well shot and a strong cast performs adequately. The film though doesn't make any sense. Though seemingly meant to be a warning about the perils of homophobia Paul is kind of creepy. His total unawareness of his surroundings and other people make him seem to not have it all together upstairs. Maggie's quest is certainly an awful hysterical pursuit but shouldn't she be worried at least initially about some space cadet hanging around children at a park? After all the press over an unresponsive system of order not protecting children from abusive men it should come as no surprise that she a mentally unbalanced person to begin with begins an illconceived exercise in vigilantism. All this seems to be offered with a sense of satire but it generally misses the mark. One of the characters needs to be a sympathetic and reasonably sane person to satirize the actions of the other. Without that it's a screwball story.In the film Paul's defining characteristic isn't that he's gay or that he's a painter. Paul more than anything else seems to be a guy who only wants to hang out with kids not that anybody finds Michael Jackson creepy.... That undermines significantly the reaction Maggie gets to the linchpin in her case Paul's homosexuality. Maggie being a nut case herself doesn't help strengthen the commentary the film offers. What we end up with is a situation that though unfortunate isn't exactly unexpected. When two totally clueless and unstable people cross paths it should be no surprise that something bad happens.".

I also think that this film is a worthy debut from him and shows great potential for his future behind and in front of the camera. Having said that I must admit the film was flawed in some critical ways.1. Nobody needs any justification for being overlycautious with one's children. It's better to be overly cautious...than careless and each parent should decide for himherself where that line is.2. Combine these factors a Paul is single b Paul has no children c Paul spends in inordinate amount of time around children d Paul resists romantic advances from a coworker and seems to have few if any adult relationships e He seeks out jobs that place him around children....when you combine these factors even though it may be wrong it does follow the profile of what many would consider as a high risk of being a pedophile. NOT PROOF...just suspicion. Honestly I would be very cautious of him. Let's be honest...these factors almost entirely describe Michael Jackson whom MANY think is guilty of child molestation whether acquitted or not.3. A few actions were not believable. Taking the little girl INTO the bathroom? Come on where was the mother? Why didn't he LOOK FOR the mother? How could any man in this day and age who is obviously over 30...NOT know this was a bad thing to do? Just didn't play believably.4. The film almost seems to be saying that we owe men like this...or any men when it comes to our children the benefit of the doubt. We do not. I don't need a reason for never letting my young son be around a grown man alone. It's just a good safe practice to disallow it. Even avowed heterosexual men. Gay or straight no man would be with my son alone. There's just no reason to allow it.Having said all of that I did enjoy the film...the story was cute in places the acting was good and the cinematography and music was engaging. I would recommend it to friends but would then want to debate the points I brought up.".

How could any man in this day and age who is obviously over 30...NOT know this was a bad thing to do? Just didn't play believably.4. The film almost seems to be saying that we owe men like this...or any men when it comes to our children the benefit of the doubt. We do not. I don't need a reason for never letting my young son be around a grown man alone. It's just a good safe practice to disallow it. Even avowed heterosexual men. Gay or straight no man would be with my son alone. There's just no reason to allow it.Having said all of that I did enjoy the film...the story was cute in places the acting was good and the cinematography and music was engaging. I would recommend it to friends but would then want to debate the points I brought up.";

In his first feature Peter as the writer director and lead actor takes us on a kaleidoscopic ride with a young gay man who by attempting to process grief crawls into denial and reverts to the safety and innocence of childhood. And in his naivet unknowingly generates false accusations of pedophilia.It would seem impossible to find comedic elements in such a film but Peter manages to do it masterfully and with great finesse while still voicing a profound statement of his own.Kathy Najimi provides much of the vehicle for that humor in the unlikely role of a homophobic housewife and does it skillfully as if by second nature.

Also this character seems REALLY mentally unbalanced. He blacks out lies about his background cannot form a stable romantic attachment becomes detached from reality can only relate to children and has what can only be described as a hyperobsession with his godchild. I'm thinking Kathy Najimy's character in the film is right...he DOES fit the profile of a pedophile.I don't know where Peter Paige was going with this movie but I think he missed his mark. I rented this film hoping for something that would break down the stereotype that gay men are freaks and pedophiles. Instead this movie just made my skin crawl.

At one point he seems to be saying that parents shouldn't be so uptight about letting men play with their kids and later seems to be emphasizing that it's gay men in particular who are demonized and then he compounds the issue by making the protagonist unbearably stupid and naive adding hints of mental disturbance didn't help one bit. He tries to mitigate it by saying I know I made some mistakes at the end but that only ends up confusing the message more. I did appreciate that there was some complexity to it but it was just too muddled. Also the second act involves a lot of repeating the same points over and over again and feels sluggish. I think the largest problem is the Kathy Najimy character. Paige paints her this is an extremely clever pun if you've seen the movie with a very broad brush she has kneejerk reactions blows things way out of proportion tells lies to whip up hysteria has mechanical sex with her husband isn't a very good parent. This is a character who belongs in a much more satirical comedy something like CITIZEN RUTH. She doesn't match the quieter and not terribly funny humor of the rest of the film. However it's not all bad. Despite a lowbudget production right here in Portland it feels pretty professional and the performances are good even when the characters aren't very well written. The film is somewhat pleasant to watch despite the subject matter. And I really did enjoy the complexity and that it wasn't as broad as it could have been if only the Najimy character had been toned down. Overall though it's a near miss.".

The coworkeradmirer goes from bitchy to honey in ONE week? Najimy portrays a concerned mother as a stereotypical gayhating shrew. The boss is a cartoon character. Then we have the very grounded best female friend. Well not so grounded...she gives this borderline retarded man a NUDE picture of her own toddler  dressed up in cowboy gear??!!Paige is a talented actor but I question his writing skills and the actual intention of this film.";

The major problem with the movie is that it is hard to believe that a man could be so naive on how many people would perceive him. Even his friend tells him that he should stop hanging around kids but Paulthe main character doesn't listen. In addition the movie tries playing the gay cardand male card too There is a scene when a mother says it was weird that a babysitter she knew was a french male in order to imply that had he been straight and female no one would care. That is absolutely false. Gay or straight male or female his behavior was creepy. Plus the movie is only 91 minutes. It should have been longer to explain why Paul is so emotionally stunted.".

Even if Paul was straight and had kids of his own adults should avoid associating with other people's children who are not known to them. This is kind of the situation Michael Jackson was in. My brother and his wife decided not to have children yet they have an obsession with seeking out preteen boys to be friends with. I am sure they would not sexually molest the boys but still  it is not normal nor acceptable behavior in my book. Furthermore even if everything is 100 innocent the adults are taking a tremendous risk in having these kinds of relationships with children.My advice to Peter Paige would be to concentrate more on his acting and directing and leave his unrealistic gay issues behind him.Statistics show that 35 of people are either gay or bisexual and of the remaining 65 there are lots of straight pedophiles criminals drunks drug abusers and people who are mentally ill. In fact the vast majority of pedophiles are straight men pursuing underage girls.This movie just obscured reality and exploited an issue for its own purposes.".

There are too many inconsistencies and after a while you start talking back to the screen frustrated with the guy's entire approach to life.

The movie drags badly. The musical score doesn't go with the tone of the film and becomes annoying. The other actors and characters are bland and one dimensional. Paige cannot elicit a single interesting performance. A wonderful character actress like Kathy Najimy gives a dull lifeless performance as Paige's adversary. The other moms are equally pedestrian as are Paige's boyfriend and boss at work. Add to that the screenplay by Paige has no wit or cleverness which was certainly needed to make such a difficult subject even work on film.For all it's good intentions the movie from a purely dramatic standpoint is a mess. The big climax doesn't really work and adds to the film's generally depressing contour. Perhaps a better writer and director could have made an engaging film out of this story.

	schema:reviewBody "One Last Thing is that rare thing a small film that's big on entertainment while never compromising its intimate feel. You'll laugh you'll cry and then you'll laugh and cry some more. One Last Thing takes the story of a teenager dying of cancer and turn it into a celebration of life that is neither sappy nor clich. On the verge of accepting a charitable organization's last wish of a fishing trip with his football hero the young Dylan throws caution to the wind and states his real wish on live TV to spend a weekend alone with supermodel Nikki Sinclair. Michael Angarano Seabiscuit Lords Of Dogstown Will  Grace as the dying Dylan Cynthia Nixon Sex and The City as his widowed mom and hot hot hot newcomer Sunny Mabrey xXx State of the Union as the gorgeous but troubled model bring amazing chemistry to Barry Stringfellow's remarkable script. Deftly directed by Alex Steyermark Prey For Rock  Roll the cast is rounded out by the likes of Gina Gershon Wyclef Jean Johnny Messner Coati Mundi Michael Rispoli. And added bonus is a wonderful uncredited turn by Ethan Hawk as Dylan's father who also died from cancer a few years before. I heard about One Last Thing of all places on my classical radio station KUSC here in L.A. Evening host Jim Svedja was so impressed by it at a screening that he took time from his usual musical broadcast to rave about the flick and interview Mr. Stringfellow Mr. Steyemark and Ms. Mabrey tough duty I'll bet. He even offered a money back guarantee. Alas HDNet the company that released One Last Thing apparently lacked his good taste and enthusiasm. After a bare bones release the film was quickly released on DVD via their genius daydate release policy. Fortunately the DVD is widely available and the small screen doesn't diminish the big pleasure that is One Last Thing. I don't have Mr. Svedja's deep pockets but I guarantee you it won't disappoint you.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that I approached this film with a little trepidation at the Tribeca Film Festival. One one hand the plot sounded a little like it might come out of an afterschool special but then again the cast had Cynthia Nixon Gina Gershon Wyclef Jean and I had heard a rumor about a certain movie star cameo. Which I won't spoil here. And I knew that Sunny Mabrey the only thing I remember from XXX2 was in it. Certainly all of these names wouldn't have been attracted by something pedestrian right? Right. The IMDb and other reviews summarize the plot so I won't do that here. Or rant that the film never got a chance to find a theatrical audience. Thanks Cuban. But what I will do is tell you that the writing and the acting elevate this film into something pretty special.It's not rare to find a funny film. It's not rare to find a sad film about death. What is rare is to find a film that is honest about its approach to death and that manages to be both very funny and sad. And while some of the laughs certainly qualify as gallows humor for anyone that has been through something like this you will appreciate the filmmakers' open approach of looking at all the shades of this experience.It is a strong testament to the film and especially the writing that from the opening scene you know how this movie is going to end yet that end is still very affecting. It was definitely more than a little dusty in the theater if you know what I mean. But the end is not cheap or manipulative. The emotions that are generated are come by honestly and true to the spirit of the characters.I'd especially like to mention the performances by all the actors playing the teenagers. These felt like real kids who were both terrified by the situation yet doing their best to get through it anyway they can. A lot of reviews have mentioned Michael Angarano and rightfully so but Matt Bush and Gideon Click are also excellent and the three of them create a really strong dynamic. And there is a killer Wyclef Jean song over the end credits.I'll also add that this movie sparked more conversation between my girlfriend and I than any we've seen and that's really saying something.So buy it rent it add it to your Netflix tell a friend. This is a film that deserves your support. You won't regret giving it a chance.".

	schema:headline " Exquisitely crafted and heartwarming surprise";
	schema:reviewBody "I had the great pleasure of seeing One Last Thing this weekend at the Philadelphia Film Festival. Twice in fact  Saturday night's East Coast Premiere and a second screening on Sunday.The plot involves a 16 yearold Dylan played by Michael Angarano who has a terminal illness. He is given a last wish by a national foundation and making that wish come true is the essence of the story. The wish and I know I'm not giving anything away here is to spend a weekend with his favorite supermodel. I generally dislike reviews because they invariably give too much away and that is especially true in this case. So in lieu of posting spoilers I'll just discuss some general impressions of the film and performances.Since the earliest days of theater tragedy and comedy often go handinhand and it's at the heart of this story. As they say you'll laugh you'll cry and the audience did. The director writer and two of the film's lead actors all hail from the Philadelphia area which also serves as the setting for much of the film and supplies fodder for the script. Yet I have no doubt that audiences elsewhere will get the joke and be able to relate to the working class oil refinery town which is home to Dylan's family and friends.The power of this film comes from the script by Barry Stringfellow and a brilliant cast led by Michael Angarano. Arguably the most soughtafter teenage actor in America Angarano is finally beginning to tackle some powerful leading roles with the soontobe released Bondage which I saw at its World Premiere last month at SXSW and now with One Last Thing. As Sky High's Will and Lords of Dogtown's Sid we saw just a hint of the powerful range of Angarano's abilities and in One Last Thing he uses both his comedic talents as well as dramatic ones in a way that we haven't really seen before. If you liked Sid you'll love Dylan.Angarano has an uncanny ability to make us laugh when we want to cry and to make us cry when we want to laugh. It's a real gift and one which is evident in films like Dear Wendy and Lords of Dogtown. But here is able to use that gift from opening to closing credits. It's no wonder that director Alex Steyermark says that Angarano was really his only choice for this role. Anyone who has seen his films will not be surprised at how elegantly he slips into this character but no doubt others who are not as familiar with his body of work will discover what many already know.To say that this is a film about a boy's carnal desires in his last days is to miss the point. Even more than that One Last Thing is about coping with loss  a son's loss of his father and a mother's loss of her son. It's also about the search for love. Carpe diem if you will. The mother here is Cynthia Nixon who is absolutely heartbreaking in a performance that can only come from deep within. This is a role that lesser actors would find daunting. Who among us hasn't experienced a similar loss? On the other hand nothing can compare to seeing your child go before you do.The love object of Dylan  there are others here is played by Sunny Mabrey. She is the image that has been but a poster on his wall and his quest to fulfill his dream is only as powerful in its resolution as Mabrey is in her ability to make a petulant supermodel a sympathetic character. But she pulls it off effortlessly. Dylan's partners in crime are his two best buds Slap and Ricky Gideon Glick and Matt Bush who provide much of the comic relief in what would otherwise have threatened to be a heavyhanded statement on death and spiritual belief. Their lines elicit the most laughs and the fact that these were two real teenagers both acting in their first film gives their performances a ring of truth which more jaded veterans might actually have had to fight to find.But what struck me more than anything was just how incredibly economical Steyermark and editor Michael Berenbaum are in their work. This is one of the most efficiently constructed films I've ever seen. The tendency lately seems to be to build slowly sometimes spending up to a third of the film on character development before you begin to see the story unfold. Not here. The basic plot is presented in the very first scene literally in the opening minutes of the film. From that point on not a moment is wasted  not a shot not a line not a frame. Every second here is valuable to the story and yet nothing feels rushed. What a breath of fresh air this was in a season of pretentious lookatmeI'manindiefilmmaker projects.Don't let the teen sex comedy poster or the ad blurbs fool you. This is a dark comedy in the true sense of the word packed with the kind of gallows humor that is made especially poignant when the subject is a high school kid. I was moved by One Last Thing and it will leave you thinking  in my book the definition of a film that has hit its mark.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was actually a good film that surprised me a little bit. When I rented it based on what I had read about it I was expecting to see a raunchy teen flick. Instead it turned out to be a notbad film that balanced comedy and drama in it. In the movie a teenager is dying from cancer. A foundation that grants wishes to dying youngsters has him appear on television to make his one last wish and everyone thinks he is going to ask for a fishing trip with his favorite football player. Instead he asks for a weekend with a hot supermodel whose bikiniclad image adorns his wall on a poster. We then shift to the supermodel who is portrayed as somewhat on the hottempered side and has totally exasperated her manager. The model is surprised when she learns about the wish and reluctantly agrees to meet him. After a couple disappointing meetings the boy becomes frustrated too. I will leave the rest to you to watch to figure out what happens. All in all this was a decent way to spend an hour and a half of your time and I recommend it. It has both funny and tearjerking moments. 12 out of ".

Instead it turned out to be a notbad film that balanced comedy and drama in it. In the movie a teenager is dying from cancer. A foundation that grants wishes to dying youngsters has him appear on television to make his one last wish and everyone thinks he is going to ask for a fishing trip with his favorite football player. Instead he asks for a weekend with a hot supermodel whose bikiniclad image adorns his wall on a poster. We then shift to the supermodel who is portrayed as somewhat on the hottempered side and has totally exasperated her manager. The model is surprised when she learns about the wish and reluctantly agrees to meet him. After a couple disappointing meetings the boy becomes frustrated too.

I don't know how to describe it without giving out spoilers  this film is a complete surprise incredibly funny and incredibly poignant  and you feel good about laughing at the jokes and crying at the sad stuff.

The script strikes the perfect balance of emotions without getting sappy. The music is amazing.

	schema:headline " A Winning Angarano Not Enough to Offset the Uneasy Blend Between Sentimental and Raucous";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a nice idea to take the standard clichdriven movie concept of a dying boy's last wish and turn it on its head into something emotionally resonant and blackly humorous. But unfortunately something goes awry in this oddly dissatisfying 2006 movie. The major problem is that director Alex Steyermark and screenwriter Barry Stringfellow never find a consistent tone to their story as it uneasily blends elements of Terms of Endearment Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Six Feet Under into an unappetizing concoction. That's a shame since a cast of solid actors has been recruited by agents I'm sure were convinced of the film's appeal.The plot focuses on an incurably ill sixteenyear old named Dylan Jameison living with his widowed mother Karen in a Philadelphia suburb. Granted a last request by a Make a Wishtype foundation he goes for the more socially acceptable wish of taking a fishing trip with his favorite football player Jason O'Malley but he reveals during the media event that his real wish is to spend a weekend alone with supermodel Nikki Sinclair. As it turns out Nikki is on a nihilistic drugaddled and alcoholsoaked slide and badly in need of a PR makeover so her savvy agent takes advantage of the situation and turns it into a photo opportunity. An offthecuff comment encourages Dylan now a media darling to visit Nikki in New York and the rest of the story as you can guess takes care of itself.Not just focusing on Dylan and his buddies the narrative also tracks Nikki's buried past and the reasons behind her current diva behavior as well as Karen's burgeoning relationship with Jason. Instead of adding texture to the story these story threads feel extraneous and compound the plot contrivances. What's more Dylan's two buddies Ricky and Slap are so interchangeable in look and hormonedriven behavior that they become tiresome quickly and it is basically left to Michael Angarano to hold the movie on his shoulders.Luckily Angarano is winning as Dylan. Most familiar to me as Jack's levelheaded biological son Elliot on Will  Grace he latches onto the heart of the character without getting either cloying or manipulative about his mortality. Sunny Mabrey does what she can as Nikki but her character arc feels elliptical and disjointed. As Dylan's mother Cynthia Nixon effortlessly finds her maternal instinct here a role quite similar to the one she played in Little Manhattan. Her wellhoned skills at camaraderie developed over the years on Sex in the City are what make her scenes with Angarano work well. Sadly though Stringfellow shoves her character into a ridiculously conceived romance.For an indie film there are a surprising number of high profile people in smaller roles  an uncredited Ethan Hawke in flashbacks and dream sequences as Dylan's father the welcome Gina Gershon as Nikki's agent Brian Stokes Mitchell Broadway's favorite troubadour as Dylan's caring doctor hiphop maestro Wyclef Jean as a mystical cab driver and Michael Rispoli also uncredited as an urban savior heavy into mysticism. But none of them are helped by the distracting clash between the sentimental and the raucous that the filmmakers seem intent upon forcing on the actors.Released less than three weeks after its theatrical release an arguable marketing tactic the DVD contains a thoughtful commentary track from Steyermark which is frankly better than listening to the film's misbegotten dialogue a worthless series of outtakes and the trailer which frankly says enough about the film if you want to avoid it entirely. There is a halfhour featurette of the film mainly interviews with Steyermark and the principals moderated by smug selfabsorbed film critic Robert Wilonsky as part of his HDNet Higher Definition series.".

	schema:reviewBody "The concept for this little Indie film  the dying wish of a teenager opening spiritual doors  is far from original but Barry Stringfellow's strong script as directed by Alex Steyermark whose only other directorial venture was 'Prey for Rock and Roll' though he has been on the crew of some very fine films like 'Pieces of April' etc results in a far from ordinary drama. For those who have not seen Cynthia Nixon expand beyond her 'Sex and the City' role this performance will be enlightening! Dylan Michael Angarano is a young teenager diagnosed with terminal cancer a fact that he shares with his loony buddies Gideon Glick and Matt Bush who support him with silly but genuine companionship. Dylan's mother Carol Cynthia is still reeling from her husband's death Ethan Hawke and facing the loss of the one remaining part of her family is devastating but her strength of character keeps a positive support for Dylan. When Dylan is informed by his doctor Brian Stokes Mitchell that further radiation and chemotherapy are useless Dylan places his desire for living on one last thing...he is on a TV show where dying wishes are granted and rather than the asking for expected fishing trip with football hero Jason Johnny Messner he opts for a weekend alone with supermodel Nikki Sinclair Sunny Mabrey. Nikki we discover has problems and demons of her own and her agent Arlene Gina Gershon in trying to rescue her faltering career advises the reluctant Nikki to visit Dylan in his home in Pennsylvania  for positive PR purposes. Once they meet Dylan is determined to have his one last thing gains money and a room a gift form Jason in New York and travels with his sidekicks to the Big Apple to cash in on his prize. The Nikki he finds is the wasted girl down at heels and though she feels tenderness toward Dylan she tells him to just go home. Dylan's disease progresses to the point of final hospitalization when Nikki reenters the sad room and changes things.The power that changes this predictable story lies in the extraordinarily sensitive performances of Michael Angarano who plays Dylan with a twinkle in his eye and allows us to feel his burden with resorting to bathos and the alwaysimpressive Cynthia Nixon whose performance as Dylan's mother is the most understated and heart wrenching on film. She owns the screen whenever she is on. The supporting cast is strong though Gideon Glick and Matt Bush are allowed to become obnoxious and would have benefited from some stronger direction. In all this is a striking simple compelling film that rises well above its premise to become an important statement about death and dying and the power of hope and love and family. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "ONE LAST THING is the next film from Magnolia Pictures. MagPics is of course the distribution arm of 2929 Entertainment which is owned by Dallas Maverick Mark Cuban.Last year 2929 announced that it was eliminating its movie windows and that it was essentially making its DVDs available in stores at the same time as the film's release in theaters.Basically if you prefer to see this movie on the big screen you can go to your nearest Landmark theater on Friday May 5th.But if you don't you can go instead to the video store and pick it up on Tuesday May 23rd and not have to wait so long for the DVD.It won't be the usual 3month or 5month distance between the film and DVD releases. However regardless of how one chooses to see it I recommend that no one does.So far MagPics and 2929 have been putting out some great material including two great documentaries ENRON THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM and HERBIE HANCOCK POSSIBILITIES as well as some interesting dramas like BUBBLE and THE WAR WITHIN so when I heard about this movie I got excited especially since I saw it playing at the Philadelphia Film Festival.Philly is my hometown and most of the movie was filmed there specifically in the Marcus Hook neighborhood. The story centers on Dylan a 16yearold kid who is dying of cancer. Cynthia Nixon from Sex and the City plays his widowed mother. United Wish Givers a MakeAWish foundationtype of organization decides to grant Dylan one wish before he keels over from cancer.At first they think his wish is to go fishing with super star football player Jason O'Malley but during the press conference Dylan recants and says his wish is really to have sex with superbeautiful super model Nikki Sinclair in her mid to upper 20s. What proceeds are Dylan's attempts to make that wish come true.But instead of ONE LAST THING the movie should have been titled The Film That Tries to Justify Statutory Rape. This film is more about taking us to a contrived destination that defies reason or believability than really giving us something honest and real. It tries to be heartfelt but really just comes off superficial and annoying.For example Dylan's two friends Ricky and Slap played by Philly natives Matt Bush and Gideon Glick tag along when Dylan sets out to New York to score with the super model but while Dylan is throwing up in the bathroom and is clearly becoming sicker all his friends want to do is concentrate on sneaking into a strip club.Wow two teenage horny boys with a one track mind! Haven't we seen this before? Haven't the American Pie movies been enough? Couldn't the screenwriter Barry Stringfellow have come up with something else a bit more original or supporting characters with maybe a bit more depth? Also Wyclef Jean plays a foreign cab driver. How clich! Jean's cab driver magically drops in here and there for no real reason and his appearance seems only to add a little color to this otherwise lame whitewashed world.Ethan Hawke makes an uncredited cameo but I'm forced to ask why. His efforts are wasted.Michael Angarano who plays Dylan is a cute kid and potentially a great actor but I was so not impressed with his performance here and quite frankly I haven't really been impressed with any of the movies I've seen him in. He was funny though as Jack's son Elliott on the NBC TV show Will  Grace.But I think there are a ton of better actors in his age group like British actors Jamie Bell and Max Minghella Canadian import Kevin Zegers Dane Christensen Jesse Eisenberg and Robert Ri'chard. Watch out for these guys in the future all of them are amazing.More amazing than I've seen Angarano but I don't really blame him though. He did the best he could with what he had to work with which wasn't much. The script here was simply senseless. Just a bad indie film! Just bad!".

The film is special from start to finish as powerful performances from Michael Arangano and Sunny Mabrey reach out from the screen and truly touch the hearts of viewers everywhere.What truly struck me about this film was the touching story. If you were dying and had one wish what would it be? Well for sixteen year old Dylan Jamieson it was his wish to spend the weekend with his favourite supermodel Nikki Sinclaire Sunny Mabrey. The story is based around Dylan's wish to meet Nikki while interlaced with touching roles played by Dylan's deceased father Ethan Hawkeand his mother Cynthia Nixonalong with his comical best friends Ricky Matt Bush and Slap Gideon Glickwho truly add a great dimension to the film! The movie is a wild and touching ride that you should surely watch as I guarantee you will enjoy this great story by Barry Stringfellow. Featuring an excellent use of the flashback technique to add a brilliant back story the writing and acting in this movie will leave you feeling satisfied time and time again!

Anyone who loves a movie will love this movie with its humour and dramatic experiences found all through the movie.

	schema:headline " Not just your average comedy...sweet and very moving!!";
	schema:reviewBody "One Last Thing is pretty much misrepresented by trailers and even by the DVD box itself. It sort of looks like a teen comedy filled with rude jokes and a National Lampoon's type film and that isn't the case at all!! Relatively new director Alex Steyermark and TV Writer Barry Stringfellow make a very moving and touching film and best of all a very real film about a teenager with terminal cancer. On top of that he interweaves a story about a super model who lost her grip on reality and in the process lost her true love and everything she believed in. The story and film is really about life and death and the struggle with it and it's brilliant!! The lead characters are brilliant and the story is captivating and touching.Young but veteran and talented actor Michael Angarano gives an honest to God Oscar worthy performance as typical teenager Dylan Jameison. The only thing about Dylan is that he is dying of cancer. Still haunted and emotionally distraught over the loss of his father he is dealing with trying to be an average kid and deal with his death feeling as though he doesn't believe in an afterlife. Angarano is so believable and heartfelt and you really connect with him and he truly does an amazing job. Cynthia Nixon plays Dylan's Mom Carol and although she kind of has more of a supporting role does a terrific job at that. This is the second time I've seen Cynthia Nixon in a role besides Sex and The City and she has done an outstanding job the first being the absolutely phenomenal Warm Springs. Nixon is great and she shows being a caring and concerned mother while having to deal with losing her son and already having lost her husband. Sunny Mabrey plays the object of Dylan's obsession...his One Last Thing.. super model Nikki Sinclaire. Mabrey is terrific as the self involved obsessive and lonely model. She slowly begins to realize what she lost by not staying grounded and she sees that through Dylan's strength while he dies. The two of them together although they share only a little screen time is sweet and lots of chemistry between them despite the age difference. Matt Bush and Gideon Glick play Dylan's best friends and at first I thought they were overused and out of place as the wise cracking rather immature stoner buddies but then I realized these guys ARE your typical teenager and they were dealing with the cancer and death of their best friend as well in their own way. I do still think they might have been a little misplaced in the film but they are there and they do a decent job. Ethan Hawke plays a strangely very small cameo as Dylan's Dad in flashbacks and dreams.The film is really made by the chemistry and story between Dylan Nikki and Carol. This film is just everything you don't expect. It's really a dark comedy and definitely no really laugh out loud moments but instead very touching elements of drama and moving moments of life lessons and clarity. This one truly is a hidden gem that might not have made a big splash but it's so definitely well worth seeing. If you love a good story maybe even some tears and laughter then One Last Thing is the absolute must see!! It's just a warm and tender film. 910".

I think we have all seen enough shallow attempts at this type of entertainment. This movie however was fresh and revolved around genuine human emotion. The ups and downs of our life here on earth. In the face of death what does a teenager do? Well this one goes out swinging. While he cannot control what is happening to his body this boy takes charge of the time he has left. It has a sweet positive message. If this were a Hollywood film I'm sure they would have found a way for the boy to miraculously live in the end. The truth is we all die. This film embraces that and makes it entertaining. I found myself laughing one minute and crying the next. The themes in this movie were true to life. The scenes of reconnection with his father were especially touching leaving the viewer with a bittersweet longing for a world where we live forever with those closest to us. I left the theater feeling pondering life and feeling inspired to make the most of it. Way to go!".

Each version has different set of Pokmon that are exclusive to its respective titles and there are indeed some differences in several aspects. Unfortunately even if it's two against any one film they are not as captivating as most of the other Pokmon films in entirety.Firstly the concept of Victini is quite interesting and it is adorable but that is not enough to make this a good one as the whole backstory and plot is just not compelling. Then while the designs of Reshiram and Zekrom are quite unique the concept of Heroes of Truth and Ideals associated with them are awfully laughable. There is just nothing to it because everything here is extremely vague. Talk about philosophy!There is also nothing much to the flying castle except that it look grand on the outside can be moved around by abusing Pokmon's powers and if it lands on the right spot it can magically stop a powerful energy known as the dragon force. Honestly nothing much stands out here except the pop up history book scene which is creative and nicely done and probably Ash Ketchum's selfless and reckless actions. So if you hate him it is most likely that you won't like this because the creators of this animated feature decided to make it Ashcentric again with these films by making him an unknown person to the kingdom as the chosen one. I am neutral towards Ash Ketchum but it is still illogical. What made it worst is that the villain is also one of the worst there is. He seems to be a good guy but he is not. He is supposed to be a bad guy but he is not really one too. There is just so many contradiction about this character Damon but I guess in the end he is just a confused guy.Which one is the better version is all up to your own liking. There are only slightly different scenes with different side of story and characters but as a whole the differences are almost unnoticeable except during the People of the Vale scenes and the appearance of Damon's Pokmon as the script and the editing is largely the same. For me these makes a bad recycling example. Sure it is certainly something new but can't deny that it is a very lazy work. I just hope this won't happen again because anyone could do the same to their films by just changing or recreating some stuffs and release it as two versions. Or worst even more than that. So it is quite sad to conclude that these films are another letdown as it has one of the worst backstory.".

	schema:headline " 14th Pokmon Movie delivers the goods";
	schema:reviewBody "POKMON THE MOVIE WHITE VICTINI AND ZEKROM 2011 played in a few hundred theaters across the country in morning screenings on December 3 and 4 2011. It was one of two Pokmon movies to be produced in Japan in 2011 both of which were among Japan's highest grossing domestic releases this year. The second one POKMON THE MOVIE BLACK VICTINI AND RESHIRAM 2011 is slated to premiere in the U.S. on the Cartoon Network on December 10. I was lucky enough to attend one of the theatrical screenings of POKMON THE MOVIE WHITE and am happy to report that it is one of the best of the franchise. I write as a Pokmon fan who's seen every one of the previous movies including theatrical screenings of the first five.This movie offers a more streamlined screenplay than the last few Pokmon movies and a pareddown group of main characters. There's about a halfhour of buildup and exposition before the narrative shifts into gear with a steady stream of suspense and excitement once all the characters wind up on a floating castle that rises up into the atmosphere leaving havoc in its wake and deliberately recalling Hayao Miyazaki's 1986 classic LAPUTA CASTLE IN THE SKY. Not a bad source of inspiration I daresay.The setting is a mountaintop town resembling settlements in the Andes with a monumental castle that sits atop a peak overlooking the town. The castle is a remnant of the Kingdom of the Vale which existed thousands of years earlier elsewhere and according to legend following a devastating war the castle was lifted up by powerful pillars of protection and brought to this peak. One young man from the region Damon seeks to restore the kingdom and reunite the scattered descendants of the People of the Vale. He captures a little psychic Pokmon called Victini and harnesses its powers to fuel the pillars and get the castle moving again. Unbeknownst to him though such a move releases the storedup Dragon Force that had been contained in the earth below the castle and which now threatens to destroy the world. Our heroes Ash Iris and Cilan along with Damon's mother and sister work to stop Damon and return the castle to Earth. They learn how to revive Zekrom an ancient black flying dragon Pokmon to help them. But first it must confront Damon's ancient white flying dragon Pokmon Reshiram.While Reshiram and Zekrom provide spectacular action setpieces in the film it's the endearing little Victini which looks like a beige squirrel with oversized pointed ears who earns our sympathy and keeps us engaged with the story. We first meet Victini which can turn invisible when it wants as it helps Ash telekinetically during a particularly perilous mountain climbing episode where Ash had tried to rescue some stranded Pokmon. The group gets to meet Victini when it's attracted by the macarons cookies offered by Cilan who has baked them himself. Local characters Juanita and daughter Carlita are impressed by the newcomers' ability to coax the elusive Victini into view and then earn its devotion. Needless to say Damon's cruel attempts to exploit Victini to carry out his selfproclaimed mission outrage Ash and company and get them involved in the action.The imagery is quite spectacular ranging from the breathtaking sight of the town of Eindoak situated atop towering mountain peaks to the scenes of the massive castle floating up in the sky high above the Earth. The castle itself is beautifully designed and laid out particularly the massive chamber where Damon uses the pillars to power the castle's moves. A helicopter piloted by the town's mayor is the one rescue vehicle summoned to duty although a robot Pokmon owned by Juanita helps out as well. On the Earth the purple flames of the Dragon Force spread out of control through the region's forests forcing hundreds of adorable wild Pokmon to flee in panic. The whole thing is quite compelling throughout. As Pokmon movies go this one ranks with Movies 1 6 and 7 as the best of the franchise although I enjoy all of them and can easily rewatch any of them.Iris and Cilan are seen in the latest Pokmon TV season Pokmon Black and White currently airing on the Cartoon Network.

Damon's other henchPokmon are different from those in the first film. For instance Reuniclus has been replaced by Gothitelle who is in one of the TV episodes but they do exactly the same thing. It hardly seems to have been worth the effort. I don't understand the rationale for making two movies from the same material that tell exactly the same story with only slight changes in the cast of Pokmon and then releasing them together.".

	onyx:emotionText "POKMON THE MOVIE WHITE VICTINI AND ZEKROM 2011 played in a few hundred theaters across the country in morning screenings on December 3 and 4 2011. It was one of two Pokmon movies to be produced in Japan in 2011 both of which were among Japan's highest grossing domestic releases this year. The second one POKMON THE MOVIE BLACK VICTINI AND RESHIRAM 2011 is slated to premiere in the U.S. on the Cartoon Network on December 10. I was lucky enough to attend one of the theatrical screenings of POKMON THE MOVIE WHITE and am happy to report that it is one of the best of the franchise. I write as a Pokmon fan who's seen every one of the previous movies including theatrical screenings of the first five.This movie offers a more streamlined screenplay than the last few Pokmon movies and a pareddown group of main characters. There's about a halfhour of buildup and exposition before the narrative shifts into gear with a steady stream of suspense and excitement once all the characters wind up on a floating castle that rises up into the atmosphere leaving havoc in its wake and deliberately recalling Hayao Miyazaki's 1986 classic LAPUTA CASTLE IN THE SKY. Not a bad source of inspiration I daresay.The setting is a mountaintop town resembling settlements in the Andes with a monumental castle that sits atop a peak overlooking the town. The castle is a remnant of the Kingdom of the Vale which existed thousands of years earlier elsewhere and according to legend following a devastating war the castle was lifted up by powerful pillars of protection and brought to this peak. One young man from the region Damon seeks to restore the kingdom and reunite the scattered descendants of the People of the Vale. He captures a little psychic Pokmon called Victini and harnesses its powers to fuel the pillars and get the castle moving again. Unbeknownst to him though such a move releases the storedup Dragon Force that had been contained in the earth below the castle and which now threatens to destroy the world. Our heroes Ash Iris and Cilan along with Damon's mother and sister work to stop Damon and return the castle to Earth. They learn how to revive Zekrom an ancient black flying dragon Pokmon to help them. But first it must confront Damon's ancient white flying dragon Pokmon Reshiram.While Reshiram and Zekrom provide spectacular action setpieces in the film it's the endearing little Victini which looks like a beige squirrel with oversized pointed ears who earns our sympathy and keeps us engaged with the story. We first meet Victini which can turn invisible when it wants as it helps Ash telekinetically during a particularly perilous mountain climbing episode where Ash had tried to rescue some stranded Pokmon. The group gets to meet Victini when it's attracted by the macarons cookies offered by Cilan who has baked them himself. Local characters Juanita and daughter Carlita are impressed by the newcomers' ability to coax the elusive Victini into view and then earn its devotion. Needless to say Damon's cruel attempts to exploit Victini to carry out his selfproclaimed mission outrage Ash and company and get them involved in the action.The imagery is quite spectacular ranging from the breathtaking sight of the town of Eindoak situated atop towering mountain peaks to the scenes of the massive castle floating up in the sky high above the Earth. The castle itself is beautifully designed and laid out particularly the massive chamber where Damon uses the pillars to power the castle's moves. A helicopter piloted by the town's mayor is the one rescue vehicle summoned to duty although a robot Pokmon owned by Juanita helps out as well. On the Earth the purple flames of the Dragon Force spread out of control through the region's forests forcing hundreds of adorable wild Pokmon to flee in panic. The whole thing is quite compelling throughout. As Pokmon movies go this one ranks with Movies 1 6 and 7 as the best of the franchise although I enjoy all of them and can easily rewatch any of them.Iris and Cilan are seen in the latest Pokmon TV season Pokmon Black and White currently airing on the Cartoon Network. It's one of the best seasons so far in the longrunning franchise and the two new characters are something of a breath of fresh air.ADDENDUM 121011 I watched the companion movie POKMON THE MOVIE BLACK VICTINI AND RESHIRAM in its premiere tonight on the Cartoon Network interrupted multiple times by commercial breaks.

	schema:reviewBody "Pokmon the Movie BlackVictini and Reshiram  WhiteVictini and Zekrom 2011 are quite special as they are the two versions of the fourteenth films just like the two versions of the game Pokmon Black  White. Each version has different set of Pokmon that are exclusive to its respective titles and there are indeed some differences in several aspects. Unfortunately even if it's two against any one film they are not as captivating as most of the other Pokmon films in entirety.Firstly the concept of Victini is quite interesting and it is adorable but that is not enough to make this a good one as the whole backstory and plot is just not compelling. Then while the designs of Reshiram and Zekrom are quite unique the concept of Heroes of Truth and Ideals associated with them are awfully laughable. There is just nothing to it because everything here is extremely vague. Talk about philosophy!There is also nothing much to the flying castle except that it look grand on the outside can be moved around by abusing Pokmon's powers and if it lands on the right spot it can magically stop a powerful energy known as the dragon force. Honestly nothing much stands out here except the pop up history book scene which is creative and nicely done and probably Ash Ketchum's selfless and reckless actions. So if you hate him it is most likely that you won't like this because the creators of this animated feature decided to make it Ashcentric again with these films by making him an unknown person to the kingdom as the chosen one. I am neutral towards Ash Ketchum but it is still illogical. What made it worst is that the villain is also one of the worst there is. He seems to be a good guy but he is not. He is supposed to be a bad guy but he is not really one too. There is just so many contradiction about this character Damon but I guess in the end he is just a confused guy.Which one is the better version is all up to your own liking. There are only slightly different scenes with different side of story and characters but as a whole the differences are almost unnoticeable except during the People of the Vale scenes and the appearance of Damon's Pokmon as the script and the editing is largely the same. For me these makes a bad recycling example. Sure it is certainly something new but can't deny that it is a very lazy work. I just hope this won't happen again because anyone could do the same to their films by just changing or recreating some stuffs and release it as two versions. Or worst even more than that. So it is quite sad to conclude that these films are another letdown as it has one of the worst backstory.".

The Mechanical Butcher is believed to be THE first SciFi film ever in film history. I could see why they say that tooprimitive but nonetheless a Science Fiction topic.A fat old hog is shoved into a box with a wheel operating it. After a couple secs the other side comes open and out comes what's left of the pigpork products all ready for people to eat. With a final burst of steam the film ends. For a Lumiere movie it's about as fictitious as they got. And despite it's age it's actually a lot more enjoyable to watch today then most of their other movies.".

The Mechanical Butcher is believed to be THE first SciFi film ever in film history. I could see why they say that tooprimitive but nonetheless a Science Fiction topic.A fat old hog is shoved into a box with a wheel operating it. After a couple secs the other side comes open and out comes what's left of the pigpork products all ready for people to eat. With a final burst of steam the film ends. For a Lumiere movie it's about as fictitious as they got. And despite it's age it's actually a lot more enjoyable to watch today then most of their other movies.";

	schema:reviewBody "There is no other movie that has made such a big impact on my life as this one. I remember well the anticipation and excitement I felt when I sat to watch it for the first time that grey day in March 1989. Upon it's release Dom za vesanje was received with rave reviews in Yugoslavia deemed as the most important movie of the Yugoslav cinema by many. And in many aspects it is. Ironically it's a gypsy movie one of a kind in former Yugoslavia. Gypsies have been principal heroes before in important movies as Skupljaci perja and Ko to tamo peva but there never was a gypsy epic like this one before. Or after.The story begins in Slovenia the year is not given but since the movie Breathless from 1983 is shown here it must be mid 80's. The main character is a young gypsy we later find out that his father was a white Sloveniannamed Perhan. His family consists of the wise and shamanlike grandmother Hatidza who is played very well by Ljubica Adzovic hard luck gambler of an uncle Merdzan and his sick sister Danira. We follow Perhan in his quest to win the beautiful Azra girl from the neighbourhood. Since her mother thinks little of Perhan and calls him a bastard Perhan decides to do anything to prove himself worthy. His chance soon comes in form of a big time gypsy hustler the so called Champion Ahmed Djida. Ahmed and his two brothers Zef and Sadam cruise around gypsy settlements looking to recruit potential thieves and hustlers and make money on them. Perhan is chosen because he possesses telekinetic powers and his charming character falls to Ahmed's liking.The character of Ahmed is perhaps the most interesting and complex one. First he is shown as a rogue with a heart of gold who takes Perhan under his wing and becomes like a father Perhan never had. He even offers to get Danira into a hospital and pay for her treatment. Later as we follow Ahmed and his sordid family we find out that they are nothing more than a gang of crooks looking to take advantage of the first naive youth with no money.Perhan is soon attracted to the world of petty crime and starts enjoying its' advantages. In not too long the poor gypsy with a less than impressive appearance is turned into a fancylooking player and charmer. When he returns home however his grandmother is appalled at the change she sees in her beloved grandson. He has changed and it is apparent also in the way he acts towards Azra. He suspects her of whoring after he finds out that she's pregnant even though he had slept with her before that. The splendor of their wedding is therefore shown in a negative way. Now that he has become more than accepted by everyone in his community especially Azra's witchy mother he is not satisfied anymore. The dream he had has vanished.He therefore decides to return to Ahmed together with Azra. This is where everything goes wrong. No matter how much Azra tries to convince him that he is the father of their child Perhan won't have none of it. We'll make our own child he responds harshly. All this pushes Azra over the edge and she dies after giving birth to their son in a visually overwhelming scene. Perhan casts himself into the abyss of self destruction and he doesn't even know what becomes of his son. He spends his days drinking and Ahmed shows concern the last time we see him do this. Soon thereafter Ahmed has a heart attack. Not long after his recovery he vanishes and takes Perhan's share of the loot. After finding out Danira is still not cured Perhan seeks revenge over Ahmed.One of the most touching moments is when Perhan meets his son named after him. Acting by Davor Dujmovic is really top notch here and it's a wonder how this 19yearold could have displayed such maturity on screen. It is a real tragedy that Dujmovic never got the chance to build a stable acting career instead being tossed crumb parts after this. It is a mystery and a disturbing thing that such a talent could have gone neglected since. Bora Todorovic is also marvelous as Ahmed and steals most of the scenes he's in. Sinolicka Trpkova as Azra also does a fine job as well as Husnija Hasimovic who plays Merdzan.This movie is a feast for the eye for it contains a good deal of interesting and spectacular imagery and dream scenes which rank up with the best ever filmed. My favourite is Perhan's first dream where he dreams about Azra and himself getting married. Some of the motifs are clearly borrowed from Tarkovski's Andrey Rublev yet the music and the scenery are incredible and carry a distinctive gypsy feel which is magic. That is what makes this movie a standout for there has rarely been done a movie about gypsies in such a stunning way. Some critics have since proclaimed Underground as Kusturica's best work but I have no doubts that this is where Kusturica topped. It was his last picture made in the former Yugoslavia and as such a magnificent farewell. The way this movie ends is really heartbreaking and leaves little hope to the viewer. But I guess Yugoslav movies rarely ever did.".

I would never ever have thought I'd enjoy seeing the world through Yugoslavian gypsies' eyes but it turned out to be possible so long as it's Kusturica who opens the window. Goran Bregovic's adorable tunes suit the movie perfectly fine too. This movie was one of those that strengthened my opinion which states European movies are a billion times better than American movies. Thanks to Kusturica and Bregovic for producing such a beauty.

The second one is absurd and insane. The third is depressing and scary. The forth is enterprising and weird. The last one is violent and tragic. To crown it all the only reason that this feature is an outsider it is not in IMDb top 250 seems to be the following not many people saw it.It doesn't look like fiction. It feels quite gritty and has very adult topics. The Gypsies look and act like Gypsies well at least to my taste and knowledge. There was once a serial on Russian TV called Karmelita where the Gypsies were shown civilized snobbish stylish in their dressing goodlooking etc. They were talking and talking in pure Russian of course phonetically perfect showing a little bit more emotion than lamas sorry my exaggeration. Personally very thankful to my relatives that they did not spend their precious watching that never ending fiction. The title song in that Gypsy serial was sung by Mr Nikolay Baskov a real Gypsy with blond hair. It lasted as long as 200 parts mixed with good portion of commercials. Instead of prolonged showing of the epic Karmelita our TV should have shown Dom za vesanje. On the other hand they would have spoiled the whole movie by pushing commercials into it. So let the matter rest.The only really bad thing about Dom za vesanje movie seems to be the way of its DVD presentation after the end of each part there is a kind of sketch of the next one before the credits roll over. These spoilers are not enjoyable.Still it also has some minor drawbacks. To me they are camerawork and the absence of powerful scenery shots i.e. the lack of the contrast and the ability to see what happens in good detail.An 8 for this poesy of human existence in hellish surroundings will do. Thank you for attention.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film Time of the Gypsies is quite entertaining but is too lacking in direction for my tastes. This movie starts out as a dark comedy starring a bastard misfit boy of a gypsy community named Perhan. The teenage boy is first shown as quite innocent and naive taking everyone for their word. Throughout this film the viewer watches helplessly as Perhan changes from the young innocent boy into a conniving untrusting thug.Perhan goes on a mission with the gypsy hustler Ahmed who promises he will take Pehan's handicapped sister to a doctor at his own expense. Of course Ahmed lies to Perhan and sends him through a series of transformations by forcing Perhan to join his group of gypsies that expose the young teen to acts of thievery prostitution and deceit. This character transformation is convincing and unfortunate but was the only redeeming factor in this movie for me.I usually prefer movies that don't stick to a specific genre but instead use whatever elements of each genre to make the best movie possible. Unfortunately I didn't like the genre mixes in this film. The first 14 of the film is a dark romantic comedy. Perhan chases a girl and wins her heart but when he cannot win her parents approval he attempts to hang himself. I found this scene more disturbing than humorous which I think it was meant to be. The rest of the film is a tragedy with Perhan's spiraling downfall into a life of lies and crime. Random magical elements are introduced along the way such as Perhan's telekinesis that is only practically used once in the film.I felt like the mixture of so many elements did not turn out as well as the director imagined they would and it became a messy storyline that I found difficult to take anything away from. Overall the film is entertaining but I felt as though it didn't have enough redeeming qualities for me to recommend it to anybody.".

The best ones are not a simple thing but an ecology of concepts and emotions that evolve in the 90 or 120 minutes that I commit to. What matters is how far from home they take me how effectively they go under and around the blocks I set to attempt to define myself. When I write a comment  even an engaging one  I am reducing the river to a photograph. As films are a shared experience some readers may be able to view that photograph and recall the actual experience. But there is a sort of pain in the pretense that you have reduced a living universe to a few static phrases.I'm particularly aware of that penalty in this case. I've seen most of Kustarica's other projects. They simply have too much story for me to fall into the flow too many boats to see the water. This has a story too about a boy a people and the concept of justice. It helps that in this case the filmmaker invested nothing in the story. Oh it is engaging because the notions are simple and the characters endearing. But it just provides an excuse for a cinematic flow.And what a flow! There are so many cinematic ideas here so many notions of visual narrative so many concepts of integration that you want to go over and over. The eye can gather so much information orders of magnitude more than we can handle in the mind. The sense of sight is the only one that has evolved an extra layer or premind before the brain gets things. The optical nerve is part conveyance and part processor. It has an eidetic memory that helps with dynamic composition. It is that perceptive mechanism that I think is exploited no celebrated here.The opening scene by itself is an introduction a disastrous wedding the establishment of a whole world of caprice and the selling of a soul all happen in one continuous shot. Along the way you have some set pieces that you just do not want to leave. There is a celebration of Saint George's day on the water that you will remember all your life and possibly relate to your first love and the creation of your child. Fire water languid seduction flow and constraint. We cross over into the world of the gypsies here being a world where morals and laws are as elastic as anything else. From any other perspective these people are parasites on the main engine of civilization thieves and beggars. But from the world we comfortably inhabit in the film they are whole and the world and values are vague. The title is not about A TIME but the sense of time.Sons and mothers mothers as fathers. Perhaps there is no more common bridge among worlds but here it is repeatedly dissolved into the background as ephemeral as the flows of geese that are the clouds in this sky. I really have no idea how the filmmaker wrangled all these animals to behave so precisely. Even with the risky and difficult long pans there are often perfectly timed actions with animals mostly birds.See this my friends. Celebrate Saint Georges day wade in the water remember your loves and resist the temptation to freeze it into a memory. Let it flow.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Time of the Gypsies";
	schema:reviewBody "The Yugoslavian film Time of the Gypsies from director Emir Kusturica tells a truly fascinating story about a young gypsy boy named Perhan and the ordeals he goes through trying to help his sick sister. What makes Perhan such an interesting character is his telekinetic powers his somewhat lack of moral and rich dreams. Not only is the protagonist a vivid character. The entire film is filled with amazingly beautiful scenes and a tremendous soundtrack.Emir Kusturica's take on the gypsies is a most interesting one. Not only does he portray them in the dirtiest gloomiest and most unpleasant place in society. Even though they reside in the slum area they seem to be unaffected by their fate and starts playing on the accordion whenever life seems unfair.It is an interesting concept that the film both starts and ends with weddings although perhaps not in the exact way one may expect. Both the story arch and Perhan's character arch are just as moving as they are strong. The transition Perhan goes through from an innocent boy whose best friend is a turkey that he seems to be able to communicate with to a slave trader who deals with children is very gripping. Just as the story starts out in true Shakespearian manner as a comedy and ends in a tragedy.There is also a reoccurring theme of betrayal throughout the story. Perhan's mother was betrayed his uncle was cheated on for his mother's attention which went to Perhan instead and Perhan himself was betrayed several times which ultimately made him betray people. Emir Kusturica uses this disillusionment to show that although they are living in this world with instances of magical realism they are humans as well fully capable of being broken flawed and cruel.Emir Kusturica creates a universe that is vast colorful and contains many magical things. All masterfully presented in a natural and fully believable way. Not only do we have Perhan's psychic abilities but his grandmother possesses certain abilities as well. Perhan's relationship with the turkey a white veil flying in the wind and several dream sequences one which takes place on a river are some of the most memorable in the entire film.This film is one of the very few made with the authentic Romani spoken language in the majority of the runtime. Just this fact alone is worthy of more attention than received. All in all it is just a phenomenal film in its own category without comparison. A must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1933 Spanish poet and theater director Federico Garcia Lorca gave a lecture in Buenos Aires titled Play and Theory of the Duende in which he addressed the fiery spirit the 'duende' behind what makes great performance stir the emotions The duende then is a power not a work. It is a struggle not a thought. I have heard an old maestro of the guitar say The duende is not in the throat the duende climbs up inside you from the soles of the feet.' Meaning this it is not a question of ability but of true living style of blood of the most ancient culture of spontaneous creation. So okay Kusturica has mostly come and gone by now. But for a while he really tapped into a valuable duende. I don't know how much of that translates overseas as anything more than feisty craziness but for those of us here at least he stirred passions that go back in time. He communicated something of the very fabric of our world.So yes a living style. Spontaneous creation. Meaning an exaggerated depiction but one rooted in a recognizable reality in ancient culture. Reckless people who consume their beings with spontaneous love or song the Balkans meant broadly as a peoples whose common life and toll under Ottoman rule brought them so close wrote ourselves into this worldview long before Kusturica. Like Goran Bregovic collected old folk songs into new renditions for these films Kusturica merely translated into cultural images. But oh so well.his is why Kusturica really spoke to common people here. He reminded them yes with so much feisty craziness about a struggle  not a thought  about a life they instinctively have known from blood so hard that sometimes it makes the eyes well up with tears of joy. About a woe so deep it can only be expressed with dance or a burning cigarette to the arm. About something inexplicable that turns the soul upside down.Two paths in life then as I see it both valuable we should strive to be either Zorbas or Buddhas. That is to say to either grasp life till it hurts or dispassionately let go. It's about living life fully in the flow of it and we either vigorously swim or we observe how it all flows away. Everything else is really halfassed stuff merely trying to stay afloat. Kusturica made films about Zorbas.All this is well. But if we have perhaps invested part of ourselves in cinema the images behind Kusturica especially here is a real joy to behold. There was Tarkovsky who inspired him so much his stare was austere like those lean Christs we find in Orthodox icons. With Kusturica Tarkovsky's camera becomes magical song embodying with ardor of life the joyous sadness of a world turned upside down  so much in the film is about things askew a house suspended in the air a man hanging himself from a bell the image of an inverted Christ in the end. So one masterful touch is the cinematic flow. The other is how the flow encompasses an entire life we have a kid who grows up to see how everything in life breaks a grownup  as this kid  who has already resigned himself to the fact and is broken himself beyond salvation a young mother who gives birth and dies like the dead mother who is only hearsay now a second Perhan who will grow up with only hearsay of that young mother but with a father who came back to him. Fascinating stuff most importantly because the symbolism is not a full circle neat precise but messy rugged with life.This is good stuff. It is just notimportant enough  in the academic sense  to be really beautiful and just incomplete enough to allow ourselves to pour into it.".

Resigned to waiting for help they settle down with drinks and talk. The conversation turns to dreams and each man tells of a recurring nightmare. Segment 1 Midnight Mess Harold Rodgers Daniel Massey tracks his sister Donna Anna Massey to a strange village and kills her to claim her share of the family inheritance. After settling down to a postmurder meal at the local restaurant he discovers the town is home to a nest of vampires Donna is not as dead as he thinks and he becomes the dish of the night when his jugular vein is tapped out as a beverage dispenser.

While they wait to be rescued they pass the time by telling each other their most recent  and strange  dreams.Rogers  Daniel Massey  tracks down his missing sister to a strange town and kills her. She had recently inherited the family fortune which he wants for himself. But he did not know that she had become a vampire...Critchit  TerryThomas  a man of fastidious habits and with an obsession for neatness marries the lovely Eleanor  Glynis Johns . His constant complaining about her untidiness drives her mad and he winds up inside his collection of storage jars...Sebastian  Curt Jurgens  is a professional stage magician. After seeing the Indian Rope Trick for himself he is impressed sufficiently to want it for his own act and resorts to murder. He now has enough rope to hang himself...Maitland  Michael Craig  comes up with the perfect insurance scam. He takes a drug designed to simulate a heart attack and then arranges for a friend  Edward Judd  to collect the money then go the cemetery where he is buried and dig him up. But the unexpected intervention of a pair of medical students causes him to lose his head...Moore  Tom Baker  is an artist who acquires voodoo powers in Haiti. From now on anything he paints comes magically to life. Returning to London he uses this ability to avenge himself on the three art dealerscritics who swindled him out of a fortune...One year after the financially successful 'Tales From The Crypt' Amicus were back with more weird tales from the E.C. Comics' back catalogue all vividly brought to life by a fine British  apart from Curt Jurgens  cast. With the likes of Arthur Mullard  as a gravedigger  Tommy Godfrey Robin Nedwell Geoffrey Davies and TerryThomas around it is fair to say that this is hardly 'The Exorcist'  which also opened that year  though.What it is is an entertaining horror picture boasting good stories and nice black comedy touches. The casting of Nedwell and Davies as medical students was in itself a joke as they were known for their roles as 'Dr.Duncan Waring' and 'Dr.Dick StuartClark' in I.T.V.'s 'Doctor' series. For copyright reasons they had to be renamed 'Tom' and 'Jerry'!  why didn't Hanna Barbera kick up a stink about that? . When Steve Coogan did a spoof of this movie for his 'Dr.Terrible's House Of Horrible' show a few years back it fell flat because the original was funny to start with.Logic occasionally goes out of the window. Why does Maitland so implicitly trust his friend to dig him up out of the grave? Why does Rogers have a meal in a restaurant only a few yards from the spot where he just killed his sister? Why does the air in Moore's safe take so long to run out? Answers on a headstone please.The cast are as one would expect marvellous. Tom Baker is suitably menacing in one of his last roles before putting on his scarf and hat to become the fourth 'Dr.Who'. TerryThomas is hilarious as the everso neat and tidy Critchit a sort of English 'Felix Ungar' from 'The Odd Couple'. Distinguished thesps Denholm Elliott and Terence Alexander are also around. The late Daniel Massey appears opposite his reallife sister Anna a neat bit of novelty casting Amicus pulled off again in 1975 when 'From Beyond The Grave' teamed Donald Pleasence with daughter Angela. Getting topdraw actors to commit themselves to a few days' filming worked a treat and was preferable  in my eyes at least  to watching talentless teenagers pretending to be scared by a loony in a fright mask. 'Vault' has for a long time played on television in a cut version without the scene where Rogers is hung upside down by vampires who then drink his blood through a tap they installed in his neck. That was in the most recent version I saw  on Film 4  although the climax where the trapped men turn into walking corpses still is missing. The ending is never in any real doubt of course. Anyone who saw even one of Amicus' earlier multistorey horror pictures will be able to predict it well in advance. But if you like your horror slightly refined and not just consisting of nonstop blood and gore you should seriously consider opening this particular vault.".

All the stories taken from the EC comics by William Gaines and Al Feldstein are great fun. These feature Daniel Massey who murders reallife sister Anna Massey for her inheritance only to walk into a restaraunt frequented by vampiresincluding his sister!  Glynis Johns is driven over the edge by her nagging husband Terry Thomas whom she kills and dismembers his body neatly putting the body parts into correctly labelled jars.  Michael Craig and Edward Judd are fun as two unloyal friends who plan to fake the death of one of them claim the insurance money and kill the other.  However the most accomplished story is left until last.  It's a superb tale about the consequences of Voodoo featuring Tom Baker as an artist who is cheated into believing his work is worthless by three men.  While working in Haiti he visits a witchdoctor who gives him power in that whatever he paints will come true.  He uses this power to get back at the people who have been profiteering behind his back but this ultimately results in horrifying circumstances!  Often criticised for being a pedestrian production director Roy Ward Baker's approach to the film is simple but very effective.  The tales are played for laughs but at the same time they all have something to say underneath.  The professional cast does it's stuff and the whole film is well staged.".

It not the easiest film to find I've only seen it at ONE video store in the midwest US and if you do track it down on the old Nostalgia Merchant label it's cut. There are quite a few scenes out of place and some cut altogether most notably the vampire sequence. It's too bad Fox couldn't pick this up and distribute it along with Tales From The Crypt. Overall I highly recommend this film and suggest getting your hands on a UNCUT Japanese import.".

Sadly this scene happens in VAULT OF HORROR 1973 exactly as it did in magazine oldies like FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND and THE MONSTER TIMES  It's a still shot!

It's done this way for dramatic effect and seems to work but I had already seen the exact same thing in printed form!However this is not to say I was disapointed.  This series of stories is very interesting with intriguing characters throughout.

	schema:headline " Nicely atmospherical horror anthology.";
	schema:reviewBody "Since all of the stories have their ups and downs I will review them each on their own. Five men are trapped in a basement with a table and chairs. They proceed to tell them stories from their nightmares that seem to real to be just a nightmare. Include Major Spoilers!Story 1 It involves a man Daniel Massey trying to hunt down his sister Played by Anna Massey as she is the beneficiary of her fathers will. After tracking her down Daniel Massey kills her and enters a restaurant. He was told they were closing but they are indeed open for a gang of vampires. If you are clever enough to find the uncut version it includes Daniel Massey getting a drinks pump stuffed into his neck and the vampires proceed to pour blood from his neck squirting it out as he spasms. Very good direction with a spooky atmosphere and an engrossing story.Story 2 It sees Arthur Gritchit Played very splendidly by TerryThomas and his new wife Eleanor settling down into their home. All is good until Arthur starts getting angry at the fact that Eleanor keeps changing the house around and not putting things back in the right places. 'Everything in its place and a place for everything. That Eleanor is the value of neatness.' Arthur says. Eleanor then tries to tidy the house up really fast before Arthur gets home. Only a few things to put away until everything gets out of hand. Arthur gets home while Eleanor has just knocked over a box of nails to put a painting on the wall with. Arthur then starts ranting 'Can't you do ANYTHING neatly!' Eleanor in a rage bashes his head with a hammer. We then see a tidy house and Arthurs body parts that have been assorted in different jars. Eleanor cackles crazily. A great performance by both characters with TerryThomas adding humor every chance he gets. A fitting ending and a story that never gets boring. I could write the story's script from memory I've seen it that many times!Story 3 Curt Jergens plays a magician who spots a woman in India chanting a rope. The trick is spectacular as Jergens can't spot how shes doing it. He offers to buy the rope but the woman refuses as it is a very special rope. Jergens pays her to do the trick at his hotel room with his wife. When the woman goes to the hotel Jergens and his wife stab her to death. When Jergens chants the rope his wife climbs it to show off. She then looks up at the ceiling and lets out a piercing scream. She disappears and blood appears on the ceiling. The rope then comes down and starts lashing Jergens as we see it has a mind of its own. It hangs Jergens and everyone can see him hanging from his hotel window. A good if predictable story that has a great performance by Jergens and good classic revenge by a stolen item. The only flaw is we don't know what the rope did to his wife.Story 4 Michael Craig is a man who fakes his own death by being buried alive expecting to be dug up later in an insurance scam. The man who should dig him up doesn't come to dig him up as he keeps the money for himself. Two college students want to dig up a corpse to use in a science project and they dig up Craigs grave. He gets up and screams in a mad rage. The two students run for it and end up causing Michael Craigs friends death as his car crashes. The grave digger who went with the two boys however has smashed Craigs head in with the spade. Another predictable story with a good ending. Craig looks rather bored in his performance yet manages to pull it off. The head bashing sequence is good and the comedy routine from the college boys is a nice touch.Story 5 Tom Baker is an artist. He has been forced to live in the carribean because his paintings were'nt selling. They were actually getting lots of money at galleries and it turns out Bakers auctioneers were lying. Baker sees a voodoo priest for a revenge spell. Baker then has the ability to paint a picture of a living thing and destroy the painting. Thus this will happen to the real life person. He paints all three auctioneers and rips the first mans hands from the painting. After an accident the mans hands are cut off. After he paints the second auctioneer he pokes out the eyes. In real life the mans wife throws acid at his face so he'll never see again. The third auctioneer gets to see his painting as Baker shows it to him. He paints a red hole in his head and the man shoots himself in the head. Baker though has painted himself and as he runs from the scene of the crime some workmen from the top room spill some water. Baker is hit by a truck and the truck runs over his face. We then cut back to Bakers painting and see that the water has ruined the painting. It has worn away Bakers face. A very clever twist with some great acting from Tom Baker and a cameo from Denholm Elliott. It is probably the best story apart from the second story.The whole movie is put together with class acting and great atmosphere. You will be engrossed and thoroughly spooked by the stories. One of the best anthology movies of all time. 8.5 out of 10.".

The opening lacks the production values and Sir Ralph Richardson of its predecessor Tales From the Crypt as the cryptkeeper sorely but the stories are all welldone with finesse from cast crew and the very able direction of an underappreciated Roy Ward Baker.  The first story is about vampires in a small English town and it is a very tasty vignette.  The second story starring Glynis Johns and TerryThomasboth funny beyond belief is the comedic relief of the film about a man who is too neat who needs to have that point hammered into his head by his wife.   For him it is definitely a jarring experience.  The third story is about a magician and his wife that kill to acquire a magic trick.  Curt Jurgens is very good as the evil magician.  A good story.  The fourth story is easily the weakest about a man buried alive for insurance. Lastly the most literate of the stories concerns Dr. Who's Tom Baker seeking revenge on those that have profited on his artwork behind his back. He gets revenge through voodoo.  All in all a great deal of fun.  As previously stated be sure to get the uncut version.".

	schema:headline " Superb horror anthology from Amicus!";
	schema:reviewBody "THE VAULT OF HORROR is the sixth in a series of seven Amicus horror anthologies. If THE MONSTER CLUB is included as part of the series this would make eight movies. Although that movie is very different from the others.I look upon the Amicus anthologies with great memories as I used to love them when I was in my teens. My feelings for them today are just as strong.THE VAULT OF HORROR is my second favourite in the series second only to FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE.There are five stories in the movie connected with a beautiful linking story showing five men becoming trapped in the basement of an office block. They share their stories as recurring dreams.The first story sees Daniel Massey looking for his sister who has inherited money from their late father. He kills her but finds out the town is not what it seems. Daniel Massey's performance is nothing special but his reallife sister Anna Massey gives an excellent performance as his screen sister. She only has brief screen time but I enjoyed her performance. Jerold Wells enjoys himself in a superb cameo and provides a great comic edge to this story.The second story sees TerryThomas as an obsessively fussy man who wants to see everything in his house neat and tidy. His comic performance here is what anyone familiar with his style would expect and he makes it a superbly enjoyable experience. Glynis Johns deserves special recognition for giving such as convincing performance a his longsuffering wife Eleanor.The third story sees Curt Jurgens and his wife played by the supremely sexy Dawn Addams in India looking for a new magic trick to showcase in their act. Jurgens comes across a young woman with a rope that rises from its basket when music is played on a flute. Jurgens is determined to get the trick at any cost. The title of the story implies what happens. Curt Jurgens who I'd rarely seen before captivated me with his performance as a curious yet devious man determined to find his next magic trick. Dawn Addams is given little to do other than demonstrate her innocent sexiness which had me hooked to the story from the beginning.The fourth story sees Michael Craig fake his death to collect his life insurance. He makes an agreement with his friend played by Edward Judd. Unfortunately they are both out to doublecross each other. Unbeknownst to Craig two medical students are hunting for a body they can use to aid their medical studies and as a result the plan goes pearshaped. This story is suitably lighthearted and includes a great cameo from Arthur Mullard as a gravedigger.The final story and perhaps the best shows Tom Baker as an artist on the island of Haiti in the Carribbean. He discovers that his paintings which he was told were worthless have been sold for a fortune by the critic and dealers who told him this. Naturally Baker is out for revenge and purchases voodoo powers from a local native tribe. He doesn't need a doll because he is a painter. I'm sure you can work out the rest. Tom Baker gives a superb performance as a normally polite dedicated artist pushed to the point of revenge. Unsurprisingly he later achieved cult status as Doctor Who in the TV series of the same name. Denholm Elliott and Terence Alexander have brief screen time as two of the conmen.Anyone familiar with the Amicus anthologies will be able to predict with ease how each story ends including the linking story. But I can promise these people that it's still great to watch.Roy Ward Baker directs what is easily my most favourite movie with his name attached. His direction may lack the creativity seen in say QUATERMASS AND THE PIT or ASYLUM but he still makes the twist endings have a superb impact that will please fans of the 1950s EC comics which the stories are adapted from. The director knows the material he is working with inside out and as such ensures the light and dark elements work together perfectly to bring to us this enjoyable gift.Overall THE VAULT OF HORROR is a mustsee for fans of the Amicus anthologies fans of other Amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies. If my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes check it out. You'll enjoy it!".

	schema:headline " Four great horror stories!";
	schema:reviewBody "The problem with these horror omnibuses is that while they often feature one or two good tales they're often spoilt by a couple of bad ones. I went into 'The Vault of Horror' expecting at least three of the five tales to be dismal but to my surprise this actually turned out to be one of the rare omnibuses  every tale is good! Roy Ward Baker the man behind the excellent omnibus 'Asylum' among other excellent films such as Quatermass and the Pit and The Vampire Lovers helms this project and does an even better job than he did with Asylum. The film features a diverse range of stories all of which are well told and very imaginative. The movie kicks off with it's weakest tale one of vampirism but even that one certainly isn't bad and offers up some camp fun. We then move on to an excellent tale about a neatnessobsessed man who comes a cropper when he continually criticises his new wife's lack of enthusiasm for his obsession. The third and best of the first part of the quintet features a rope charmer and a magician and makes for compelling viewing because there aren't many tales of this nature within the horror genre.The final two tales take influence from some of the true classics of horror and make for interesting viewing to say the least. The fourth tale in the film sees a man trying to trick an insurance company by slowing his heart down and being buried alive. While this tale is predictable it is kept alive by the horror of premature burial and while it doesn't truly echo the brilliance of Edgar Allen Poe it's a nice entry into the film. The Vault of Horror saves the best story until the end. The final tale is a great mix of voodoo and vengeance and works thanks to a constant sense of intrigue and some horrific sequences. The film on the whole is very camp and while the acting and script are rather trite it's low budget styling pulls it through and ensures that the film is an enjoyable ride throughout. The wraparound story hinges a little too much on coincidence at first and seems a little silly but this is resolved at the end and when we finally realise why these stories are being told  the film falls into place. On the whole this is one of the best horror omnibuses that I've seen and I give it a firm two thumbs up!".

The third and best of the first part of the quintet features a rope charmer and a magician and makes for compelling viewing because there aren't many tales of this nature within the horror genre.The final two tales take influence from some of the true classics of horror and make for interesting viewing to say the least. The fourth tale in the film sees a man trying to trick an insurance company by slowing his heart down and being buried alive. While this tale is predictable it is kept alive by the horror of premature burial and while it doesn't truly echo the brilliance of Edgar Allen Poe it's a nice entry into the film. The Vault of Horror saves the best story until the end. The final tale is a great mix of voodoo and vengeance and works thanks to a constant sense of intrigue and some horrific sequences. The film on the whole is very camp and while the acting and script are rather trite it's low budget styling pulls it through and ensures that the film is an enjoyable ride throughout. The wraparound story hinges a little too much on coincidence at first and seems a little silly but this is resolved at the end and when we finally realise why these stories are being told  the film falls into place. On the whole this is one of the best horror omnibuses that I've seen and I give it a firm two thumbs up!";

'The Vault Of Horror' has an even better cast of actors than 'Asylum' but is slightly less enjoyable for me. Maybe it's because there's five stories instead of four and is therefore a bit rushed in places but a lot of it has to do with the uncertainty of the tone. Gruesome black comedy is easy to pull off in a comic book but not so easy in a movie. Well not in this movie anyway. It's starts off strangely almost like a Bunuel film. Five strangers Donald Massey TerryThomas Curt Jurgens Michael Craig Tom Baker enter a lift which unexpectedly takes them down to a basement. They get out and see a table waiting for them so they sit and begin to recount nightmares that haunt them. Massey's involves looking for his missing sister TerryThomas plays a newly married neat freak Jurgens a magician looking for new ideas in India Craig a man with an ingenious insurance scam and Baker a painter who uses voodoo to punish his enemies. All the stories have their moments but the final one starring Tom Baker just before he became Dr Who 4 is the most effective. The film is full of well known faces in supporting roles including Denholm Elliot Glynis Johns Edward Judd and even a surprise appearance from Robin Nedwell and Geoffrey Davies from the Doctor TV shows playing yes medical students. I can't honestly say that 'The Vault Of Horror' is all that good but I enjoyed it for the most part and if you approach it not expecting all that much you should have some fun.".

If you are like me than you have been waiting for a long time to see Vault released on DVD and you are probably a little mad at the TV version that was put on DVD. I think most of the hard core fans are aware of the spigot scene being substituted with a freeze frame but the butchering does not end there. I found 3 major cuts in the film. The spigot scene is at least 5 seconds and contains a great look on the victim's face when the Vampire fills his glass 2x. Another cut is in the second story when the disgruntled wife puts a hammer into her ill fated husband's head. On the DVD it is a still shot at least not blackened out and censored like the spigot but in the uncut version he comedically gets the hammer in the head and falls backwards in Three Stooges fashion. I wonder why someone thought it was OK to show a hammer going into his head but not show him falling backwards. The last cut I found was when the wife shows the jars of body parts from her husbandalso second story. There is a jar that looks very phallic and is labeled Odds and Ends! Hilarious did someone say John Bobbitt?My last kvetch is that the film is just not framed correctly when transfered to DVD. There are many scenes when the actors have their head cut directly above the eye line. I have seen a lot of Roy Ward Baker's work and I know that it is a poor transfer from a television print and not the work of the director. Really sad because I love this film. Buy the DVD for Tales from the Crypt and enjoy Vault because it is out on DVD. Maybe someday we will get a better transfer for Vault.".

The film starts with the camera gliding across the London skyline including a long shot of the houses of parliament just so you know we're in London finally resting on a large office building. In the building a man enters a lift as the lift descends to the lower floors it stops a further four times each time another man entering. However the lift fails to stop at the lobby and carries on down to small room with a table in the middle surrounded by five chairs one for each man. They decide to wait as they do so they tell each other stories of their recurring nightmares.First up its 'midnight mess' with Daniel Massey. He plays a man who hires someone to track his sister down played by Anna Massey. She is found in a small town he visits her so he can claim an inheritance all for himself. The residents of the town and his sister aren't quite what they first seem however. A good segment very enjoyable.Then it's Terry Thomas and Glynis Johns in 'A neat job'. Thomas recounts the story of how he drives his newly wed wife to take out a gruesome revenge on him. Another good story it build up very well and I liked the very appropriate twist ending.The third story 'This trick'll kill you' sees Curt Jurgens and Dawn Adams as a magician and his wife who while visiting India try to steal a magic trick for their act. But things don't quite go as they had planned. In my opinion this is the weakest story a bit dull and predictable and there's no real twist involved. Poor.The fourth story entitled 'Bargain in death' has Micheal Craig as a broke writer in a nice touch by the filmmakers at one point he says there's no money in horror. Maybe the filmmakers are trying to tell us something! And in another nice touch in this segment he settles down to read a book as the camera zooms in the book happens to be the novelization of a previous Amicus horror anthology tales from the crypt! A great moment for fans. He sets his own death up to try and collect the insurance money with the help of a friend Edward Judd. Once again things end up far from what he had planned. This story relies on a lot of silly coincidences and for you to forget about any sort of logic. It also lacks any real horror elements being nothing more than a short tale of crime mystery and double cross. Average.The fifth and final story stars Tom Baker Denholm Elliott and Terence Alexander. Baker plays an artist who is lied to by art critics and gallery owners about his paintings and make huge profits by selling them. He uses voodoo to take a horrible revenge. Another great story maybe the best. Good fun.Directed by Roy Ward Baker this is a great little anthology film. A fine score by Douglas Gamley and pretty good performances by the all star cast help. There's not much violence in it but whats there adds to the film and isn't just there to be gratuitous. Try and get hold of the uncut version as the cuts listed in the 'alternate versions' section on the IMDb would really hurt the final twists of one or two of the segments. An enjoyable horror film well worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's something so deliciously cheesy about British horror films from the 60s and 70s. Badly dubbed erratically edited and with cranky dialogue they're awful yet wonderful at the same time.Most anthology films seem to take the basic template of the superb Dead of Night yet fail in two important respects. One is the colour. The 80s may be the biggest fashion disaster but for home decor the ubiquitous browns and oranges of this era are a horrific mistake to be forever avoided. The other is that Dead of Night's framing story was at least as interesting as the tales that it surrounded. In The Vault of Horror it's just five blokes sat around a table discussing nightmares. The ultimate resolution to this is quite familiar to fans of Brit Horror and is pretty much identical to similar conclusions in Dr. Terror's House of Horrors 1965 and sortof prequel Tales From The Crypt 1972.The stories themselves don't lend much to narrative tension given that it's openly stated that they're dreams. Mind you most of the tales are campy affairs that only prePC Britain could have produced anyway. Middle class vampires with their own restaurant chain a hen cockerel? pecked housewife with a hammer fetish a stereotyped India replete with sitars and magic rope trick and Tom Baker as a portrait artist specialising in voodoo. It's the sort of thing ripe for satire which makes it all the more disappointing that Steve Coogan's Dr. Terror's House of Horrible wasn't really very good. The Indian girl with the rope trick is even a white actress Jasmina Hilton browned up for goodness' sake!The film could make for a good study as it shows an interesting line in what really frightened middle class Englishmen at the time. Not mummies demons or Frankenstein's monster. Instead we get misogyny and racial minorities. The fourth story sets itself out from the preceding ones by actually opening strongly  a man buried alive  rather than the somewhat laborious pace of the others. However it too goes nowhere and with Arthur Mullard as a gravedigger it's the campest of the lot.Prize for the best segment then goes to the voodoo art of Tom Baker in the final tale. Punningly titled Drawn and Quartered the rankness of this subtitle is only bettered by the first's Midnight Mess. Not scary witty or particularly inspired it's weird because this film is rubbish yet I really quite liked it.".

	onyx:emotionText "There's something so deliciously cheesy about British horror films from the 60s and 70s. Badly dubbed erratically edited and with cranky dialogue they're awful yet wonderful at the same time.Most anthology films seem to take the basic template of the superb Dead of Night yet fail in two important respects. One is the colour. The 80s may be the biggest fashion disaster but for home decor the ubiquitous browns and oranges of this era are a horrific mistake to be forever avoided. The other is that Dead of Night's framing story was at least as interesting as the tales that it surrounded. In The Vault of Horror it's just five blokes sat around a table discussing nightmares. The ultimate resolution to this is quite familiar to fans of Brit Horror and is pretty much identical to similar conclusions in Dr. Terror's House of Horrors 1965 and sortof prequel Tales From The Crypt 1972.The stories themselves don't lend much to narrative tension given that it's openly stated that they're dreams. Mind you most of the tales are campy affairs that only prePC Britain could have produced anyway. Middle class vampires with their own restaurant chain a hen cockerel? pecked housewife with a hammer fetish a stereotyped India replete with sitars and magic rope trick and Tom Baker as a portrait artist specialising in voodoo. It's the sort of thing ripe for satire which makes it all the more disappointing that Steve Coogan's Dr. Terror's House of Horrible wasn't really very good. The Indian girl with the rope trick is even a white actress Jasmina Hilton browned up for goodness' sake!The film could make for a good study as it shows an interesting line in what really frightened middle class Englishmen at the time. Not mummies demons or Frankenstein's monster. Instead we get misogyny and racial minorities. The fourth story sets itself out from the preceding ones by actually opening strongly  a man buried alive  rather than the somewhat laborious pace of the others. However it too goes nowhere and with Arthur Mullard as a gravedigger it's the campest of the lot.Prize for the best segment then goes to the voodoo art of Tom Baker in the final tale. Punningly titled Drawn and Quartered the rankness of this subtitle is only bettered by the first's Midnight Mess. Not scary witty or particularly inspired it's weird because this film is rubbish yet I really quite liked it.";

	schema:reviewBody "There are a lot just like a music compilation of disappointments with a segmented arrangement. Much like an orange that's maybe got a 'segment' on the turn I find these horror anthology films. The three mainstays of this genre this film Doctor Terror's House of Horror and Tales from the Crypt are the best known. One way to view it is to remember those segments that were most memorable when you hadn't seen the film for years. My most memorable one is 'The neat job' with TerryThomas and Glynis Johns where the neatfreaked Mr Thomas plays Arthur an astute rich and successful oldie now looking to finally settle down with a little wife in the form of posh but impoverished Glynis Johns as Eleanor. It's not long before his neatist ways surface after she tries to rearrange the roomsfurniture whatever else would be out of place to him. Eleanor bored one evening slightly on edge awaiting Arthur's also punctual return accidentally knocks things over and in attending to them in turn indirectly causes more mayhem and messdamage  not advisable for a neat freak who's about to return home in ten minutes! It nicely reaches a point where even though Eleanor has had many shriekings from Arthur before he catches her in his workshop after trying to rehang a picture she'd knocked off the wall with a nail. On seeing the mess Arthur lets rip but we cut to Eleanor's face like a raging tiger and thumping Arthur on the nut violently with the hammer in her hand. It doesn't quite end there. It shows Eleanor pleasantly walking around stating 'you said I couldn't be neat' well she goes on to say everything's in its place NOW Arthur. A large wall shows lots of jars with Arthur's body parts properly labelledup. Some have questioned as we do whether Arthur should find himself within the final rollcall of Curd Jurgens end Epitaph? for all the bad people who ended up in a sticky end as truly evil enough but he was still torturing poor old Eleanor! I found the one with Mr Jurgens and Dawn Addams familiar too. A serious magician finds an act in India a magic rope trick too good to be true. The daughterassistant of the fakirlike chap refuses to sell it to him so he murders her. Dawn Addams tries out the the trick by climbing the rope and suddenly looks up and screams and disappears disturbingly as if taken into another world with a patch of blood on the ceiling then the rope calmly wraps itself around Jurgens' neck and strangles him  we then see the girl whom was murdered back with the rope trick in the market  as if to say she has all power with the rope trick a bit like Robert De Niro's part as Al Capone in 'The Untouchables' 'If someone messes with me I'm gonna mess with them!'. Tom Baker's Voodoo one is easy but still watchable  the artist whose career could've done better was brought to that by critics who who panned his paintings so they then bought them cheap and you guessed it sold them for a massive profit. As Baker enlists a voodooman or Witch Doctor if you like as he's in a kind of selfimposed exile in the Caribbean somewhere you can guess he's going to paint rather than stick pins in a doll As he asks the latter he's reminded as an artist he can just 'paint' to do his deeds. Again the three men who wronged him have portraits painted by Baker and are naturally dissected One loses his eyes another his hands and Denholm Elliot's character shoots himself. Baker has forgotten his own portrait though locked in a safe and forgetting also he needs air! He manages to open the safe in time to stop HIMSELF suffocating. Trouble is he has left it out and below a skylight where a painter Of the decorating kind is on a platform spills some stripper which crashes through the skylight and nicely smudges away Baker's selfportrait. Next it cuts to the latter running across a road into the path of a lorry and getting smudged horribly himself! The other stories in this include a good tongueincheek one with the Masseys about vampires. Daniel Massey kills his own sister and then finds himself unwittingly in a restaurant of the vamps add to that his dead sister and all put a tap into his neck like a beer keg and have a blood fest. The other story with Michael Craig and Edward Judd about faking death to cop the insurance only for Craig to find himself really dead. Curd Jurgens leads the way in explaining how the men met up  to repeat and suffer telling these stories to one another each night for eternity. Simliar of course to the other two films mentioned. A welcome kitsch Britshhorror type flick!".

Of the others Midnight Mess is quirky fun about a restaurant full of vampires The Neat Job is an agreeable vignette and This Trick Will Kill You and Bargin In Death hardly worth the time. Still the whole thing is never less than watchable.The central revelation that the characters are all dead and are reliving their sins will hardly come as a surprise to those familiar with other Amicus compendiums they all end the same! although all TerryThomas does is complain about his new wife's bad housekeeping which makes his fate seem a little harsh! Good fun and lovers of interior design can well enjoy the truly terrible wallpaper and fashion sense on display here. Poor Glynnis Johns  where did she get that outfit???".

Five men enter the building's lift at various levels going down to the ground floor. The lift carries on to the subbasement where the men find themselves trapped. To kill the time they recount their recurring nightmares to each other.Whilst much about these anthology films is substandard the short story format doesn't allow boredom to set in and as a viewer I find them enjoyable to watch. They know their limitations and concentrate on giving the horror fan numerous quickfixes to keep him more than happy.'Vault of Horror' isn't quite up to the standard of the two genre classics mentioned earlier but its certainly up with the likes of 'Asylum' and 'From Beyond the Grave' the latter being slightly overrated in my opinion.As is usual the five stories range in quality  the 1st and 3rd segments Midnight Mess  This Trick'll Kill You are the aboveaverage standard fare the 2nd segment The Neat Job looks like it is the comic relief story. This impression is mainly due to TerryThomas in the main role and on closer inspection the segment is more of a psychological horrorthriller entry  not as fun to watch but still average. The 4th story Bargain in Death is the disappointment  the story is fine featuring insurance fraud betrayal premature burial etc. but the segment selfdestructs with implausible coincidences poor dialogue and disastrous comicrelief  Arthur Mullard as a gravedigger and Robin Nedwell as a medical student. This leaves Tom Baker to rescue things in the final story Drawn and Quartered as a vengeful artist who's been ripped off by critics and gallery owners. This is a longer segment with good characterisation and a decent script which could have been fleshed out into a fulllength horror film in its own right.We all know what will happen in the end but this only reinforces the affection that fans will have for the film and others like it. It really is a shame that Hammer didn't branch out into the anthology area in the early 70's as well  with these films Amicus proves itself to be the near equal of that more famous British studio.".

They just weren't very interesting or scary. The second one starring TerryThomas wasn't exactly brilliant but was pretty enjoyable and the final scene though a tad cheesy made me really laughso it was worthwhile. The only one of the five that really worked well was the final segment that starred Tom Baker you know the Dr. Who that everyone liked so much in the 1970s. Baker played an angry artist who wanted revenge on three men who had cheated him and the way this played out was indeed clever. Because of this and the concluding scene at least the movie ended on a positive note. However due to the film's highly uneven nature I'd not recommend it. It's not so much badit's just not very good either. Apparently I am in the minority though as several other reviewers liked it.By the way a very very similar film was also made by this same production company ASYLUM as it involves four different stories strung together with a central theme.

I knew where it was going after about 20 minutes and I wasn't wrong.Despite liking Adam Scott as an actor I really didn't like his character. There was something about him which made me want to punch him in the face. Jennifer Westfeldt is average in it and I had no urge at any point to punch her. The comedic talents of Chris O'Dowd are wasted which is a shame because he could have brought a lot more to the film. The same goes for Kristen Wiig we never get to see her at her hilarious best. Megan Fox is beautiful as ever but rather irritating.The plot is thin and just lacked realism. It was also far too predictable and I spent most of the time guessing usually correctly what was about to happen.All in all this film is poor but it could have been so much better if the actors had been put to better use.".

This kind of frankness is extended to the marital experience of the shared bathroom frustration of shared chores mom's postpregnancy body and baby poo. Funny? Actually yes. Light or romantic not for a moment.The story didn't head in the direction I expected given the title. It's not a sly comedy or satire of parenthood or how the experience changes a person or a couple.

For some reason a writer will feel that they know the secret to human beings that will totally connect with audiences and make them say Finally someone gets it. Of course this never works and it always comes off as artificial and forced from the actors. Thankfully this doesn't happen so much here with Jennifer Westfeldt's directorial debut she also wrote it. There are a few moments where this can slightly creep in but for the most part it actually tackles things in a refreshing honest way and I was surprised by that.Of course the premise two thirtysomething best friends decide to stop waiting and have a kid together is straight from the romcom horsecrap handbook but there are some turns along the way that I thought were surprisingly dark and genuine for something with such a cheap hokey idea. There are some scenes that key into the stupidity of it all and I was impressed with how Westfeldt's script delved into that. Then again the film does end up being a pretty standard romcom at the end of it all so it kind of takes a jab at itself in the end.Westfeldt assembled a nice group of her actor friends to play out the parts but unfortunately she didn't have the smarts to cast someone other than herself in the lead. Her colead Adam Scott and the supporting cast are all fantastic here in particular Jon Hamm who steals the entire movie as far as I'm concerned but the director herself is a very cold and robotic actor. It was hard to feel anything for her or her dynamic with Scott when I couldn't even buy her as a real person. Overall though this is a solid film of it's type with slightly better writing a great cast for the most part and unfortunately one god awful ending.".

So the opening 45 minutes was pretty must grist to my particular mill. And then three lovely moments were subtly conveyed in the remainder of the film there were no fanfares or big shiny signposts which made it all the better. I'm not going to say what they are dare you to find them for yourselves. All I can say is for me the film got love just right and actually made me slightly very very slightly broody. This is the kind of film which I think is rarely done well and whilst there's always room for Scifi thriller and horror in my world at least a well observed funny and moving commentary on the human state that you can relate to is what I think filmmakers should be most proud to do. It makes you think it makes you feel part of something more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Friends With Kids starts off as a wonderfully entertaining very funny and truly smart film about two close friends who do the unconventional and decide to have a baby together...as friends. Unfortunately what starts off as a great strong original comedy soon downward spirals into the unfortunate abyss of RomCom hell.What sparks this decision? The fact that they watched their four closest friends two couples go through relationship hell due to the onset of...children. The couple who used to have sex in bathrooms hardly talk to each other and the happygolucky couple do nothing but bicker.So Julie and Jason figure they might as well have a kid together skipping the affect this has on a relationship as they can simply continue to date others. In other words they skipped marriage and went right to the divorce.Jennifer Westfeldt plays Julie but also wrote and directed this film. You might recognize her from the fantasticbutshortlived comedy Notes from the Underbelly or the eighth season of 24 but she also wrote the excellent film Kissing Jessica Stein this film somewhat proving that Stein was not a fluke.Westfeldt could be a comedic force to be reckoned with. If she avoids any further Hollywood trappings.FWK as mentioned does start off in an excellent fashion. An honest funny harsh crude look at child rearing for Gen Y. And even though it has been getting some criticisms for making it look like children will ruin any relationship that is not the point Westfeldt was trying to make in some sort of blanket statement. She was looking at just a specific group of friends and what a great bunch they are! Parks and Recreation star Adam Scott takes the lead as Jason Julie's platonic baby daddy. SNLalum and Bridesmaids star Maya Rudolph is the highly stressed and easily irritated Leslie while Bridesmaids's Chris O'Dowd plays her slacker husband. As for the other couple it is just unfortunate they didn't get more screen time both having been slightly underutilized the magnificent Kirsten Wiig SNL and Jon Hamm Mad Men as the onceoversexedandnowoverdrinking couple who are unravelling both also having starred in that little film called....Bridesmaids. Jon Hamm also has the distinction of being Jennifer Westfeldt's husband....in real life.Sadly what starts off as a hilarious and irreverent comedy about love marriage and babies culminating in a wonderfully executed standoff between friends at a cabin in Vermont suddenly takes an alltoo familiar and completely unnecessary clichd Hollywood turn as SPOLIER ALERT! what was once platonic suddenly changes to something not so platonic completely ruining the wonderful flow of an otherwise excellent comedy.If Westfeldt had only kept friends as friends this may have been a far more memorable and original film but she inexplicably decided to make one wrong turn leaving this film with an ending equal to that of a huge stack of useless RomComs. An utterly disappointing predictable end to a film that was up until the last fifteen minutes a truly great comedy of higherthanusual standard.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 2011 we were faced with two films asking whether or not it was possible for two people to casually have sex and unintentionally fall in love with one another. In 2012 we are presented with from what I can see one film that asks a more debatable and better question is it possible for two people that are vaguely attracted to one another to have a baby and while raising it make efforts to meet and see other people? I'll be completely honest and say I could not and would not ever want to do this although the idea when put on the table immediately sparked my interest. Not only does the idea of having kids disinterest me completely at this point in time but I find that plan sort of selfish and unfair on both the parents and the child. If the parents seek out relationships with other people the inevitability of it all will be that one or both of the parents will become so caught up in the new relationship that they will dump the baby on the other person. And unfair for the child because every baby deserves a prominent mom and dad figure in their life.Friends With Kids asks this question using two couples and two very close friends as the subjects. The two friends are Jason Adam Scott and Julie Jennifer Westfeldt who serves as the writer one of the six producers and director who have been the kind of people who are truly meant for each other but neither one will wake up and realize it. Their friends are the collective Alex and Leslie Chris O'Dowd and Maya Rudolph and the intimate sexhounds Ben and Missy Jon Hamm and Kristen Wiig all four are Bridesmaids alumni. The film opens with them childless happy and even more ecstatic once Leslie announces that she will be having a baby at dinner at a luxurious New York restaurant.Four years later the two couples have children and their marriages lack the intimacy and cheeriness they once bubbled with. The only two that still seem remotely happy are Jason and Julie who both remain single and childless. After a disastrous party for Jason the two talk over the idea of having children something Julie has wanted for a while seeing as she is older than Jason. Jason and Julie figure that if they have a baby together and then proceed to move forward by dating other people yet still taking care of the kid their relationship as friends will not suffer.They decide to do this on a whim and out of convenience and nine months later they have a child. Now here comes the inevitable part they must support it yet are trying to seek out new people to date as well. Jason falls lust at first sight when he meets the offbeat and attractive Megan Fox's Mary Jane and Julie can't seem to take her eyes off the rather clich everyman Kurt Edward Burns.Their friends are concerned for their behavior mainly because they believe the havingachildwithoutplanstomarry setup was an impulsive and foolish decision on their part. One area Friends With Kids absolutely wins at is its ability to have believable reallife conversations that are projected through a mature human scope. One of the most heartbreaking scenes involves Jason a rather selfabsorbed egotistical character confessing to Julie why they could never be together. This scene doesn't pull any punches. It genuinely makes its audience wince. No sight gags or oneliners involved.Another perfect scene involved Jon Hamm's Ben lecturing Jason on why having a kid was a stupid idea on his part and how the kid may grow up to be confused and troubled by not having two firm parental figures in his life. These are the scenes that create great humanity and drama between the characters in an noncontrived believable manner.Friends With Kids feels like an exercise in Woody Allenesque filmmaking right down to the intellectual characters and the subtle character the state of New York plays. It's charming often quite poignant and perhaps offers some keen insights about the idea of raising children that is often forgone in many modern romantic comedies. It's endearing and reassuring to see a picture so true to its romantic comedy title.Starring Adam Scott Jennifer Westfeldt Chris O'Dowd Maya Rudolph Kristen Wiig and Jon Hamm. Directed by Jennifer Westfeldt.".

It's simply  okay. It's like watching people who are quite nice going through a storyline which is slightly familiar. No alarms and no surprises.I don't wish to add spoilers but one crucial scene which for me explains all the films weaknesses is this Jennifer Westfeldt looks at herself in the mirror wearing a pair of heels she decides she doesn't like them  so takes them off and puts on a pair of boots which zip up the side. She sits down on a bed and puts them on one at a time then once again she looks at herself in the mirror. This time she is happy with her choice. This is shot in real time and if memory serves correctly without an edit. Takes about 45 secs. When you write  direct and star  especially when you haven't been in a movie for a while screen time must be very exciting but filming yourself looking at yourself  pretty explains the whole movie for me.There's a good reason Kristen Wigg features on the poster Bridesmaids made millions she's funny and has got game.But imagine being in the marketing meeting where you had to explain to Jennifer why her face wouldn't be appearing in any of the advertisements for the film she wrote directed and starred in.

It is heavily derivative of your favorite Nora Ephron movies in plot character and flavor i.e. it depicts the lives of a bunch of slender white folks with great senses of style and HUGE gorgeous apartments in NYC who go to parties way cooler than the ones you go to and never addresses how anyone pays for any of this. In a nut shell Julie and Jason are best and completely platonic friends who are part of a group of married friends all of whom used to be happy until junior came along and now they scream at each other all the time. JJ decide they can beat this trap by having a kid with each other getting that life goal out of the way while freeing themselves up to find the one who they will not be inclined to scream at. The movie makes a great show of their HarryMetSallyesque friendship in fact it would have been more subtle had there been captions screaming AREN'T THEY PERFECT FOR ONE ANOTHER?? during their playful banter. So why don't they give love a shot? Because Jason is 100 clear with Julie that she is not hot enough for him which is confusing given that Julie is pretty hot. It turns out that Megan Fox is hot enough. MF is in tiptop form here in a roll that was surely custom made for her the entire point of her character is be gorgeous and make statements about how selfabsorbed and shallow she is which for some reason come off as completely believable. Anyway Julie is heartbroken at Jason's rejection and the coparentingfriendship deteriorates. I actually had high hopes for the movie at this point. It seemed like perhaps it would eschew the formulaic romcom resolution it had been threatening all along and show instead how Julie moves past her pain and Jason deals with the consequences of his poorly advised romantic choices because they need to continue to parent the child they rather flippantly decided to bring into the world. But my hopes were dashed and instead Jason has a complete and unexplained attitude reversal and decides that Julie IS hot enough for him and races over to her apartment to woo her. She of course accepts his advances even though his version of Harry's New Year's Eve speech features the line I want to fck the sht out of you right now prominently. Is that supposed to be romantic? Gross! Now I'd better get back to my Kegels before my true love comments on how loose my vagina is after birthing our child.".

Adam Scott  Jennifer Wesfeldt are perfect in their roles. Maya Rudolph is great as always and Chris O'Dowd is fine. Megan Fox is extremely hot even in jean and simply shirt.

	schema:headline " Friends with Kids is mediocre but moderately entertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "North American cinema is already quite saturated of films about the vicissitudes from pretty people but in spite of that I was interested in watching Friends with Kids because its cast included various solid actors and because it was Jennifer Westfeldt's debut as a director. One of her previous works as a screenwriter was for the film Kissing Jessica Stein one of my favorite romantic comedies which had a sarcasticindieemotive voice which distinguished it from the competence and that's exactly what I expected from Friends with Kids however I wasn't left very satisfied by this film because even though it's a bit distant from being the typical romantic comedy it sacrifices acid humor for the sake of commercialism and it ends up being as predictable as most of the films from the same genre.Friends with Kids offers some moderately interesting comments about the setbacks from marriage and the erosion of romance in front of the relentless onslaught of domestic coexistence. However the screenplay quickly degenerates into clichs and it employs forced conflicts and artificial drama in search of the drama which isn't very credible nor satisfactory. What is more there's a point in which the film is near from falling into the soapopera field. Nevertheless Westfeldt Adam Scott Kristen Wiig Maya Rudolph Chris O'Dowd and Jon Hamm Westfeldt's romantic partner in real life bring sincere performances and they are the main reason why this film is worthy of a slight recommendation.Friends with Kids spills in every frame the pretension from New Yorker yuppie cinema with characters too plunged into their own melodrama in order to realize that many of their problems are absurd and could have an easy solution if they were less selfish and more mature. Anyway as I previously said I can slightly recommend Friends with Kids mainly because of the competent performances.".

One of her previous works as a screenwriter was for the film Kissing Jessica Stein one of my favorite romantic comedies which had a sarcasticindieemotive voice which distinguished it from the competence and that's exactly what I expected from Friends with Kids however I wasn't left very satisfied by this film because even though it's a bit distant from being the typical romantic comedy it sacrifices acid humor for the sake of commercialism and it ends up being as predictable as most of the films from the same genre.Friends with Kids offers some moderately interesting comments about the setbacks from marriage and the erosion of romance in front of the relentless onslaught of domestic coexistence. However the screenplay quickly degenerates into clichs and it employs forced conflicts and artificial drama in search of the drama which isn't very credible nor satisfactory. What is more there's a point in which the film is near from falling into the soapopera field. Nevertheless Westfeldt Adam Scott Kristen Wiig Maya Rudolph Chris O'Dowd and Jon Hamm Westfeldt's romantic partner in real life bring sincere performances and they are the main reason why this film is worthy of a slight recommendation.Friends with Kids spills in every frame the pretension from New Yorker yuppie cinema with characters too plunged into their own melodrama in order to realize that many of their problems are absurd and could have an easy solution if they were less selfish and more mature. Anyway as I previously said I can slightly recommend Friends with Kids mainly because of the competent performances.";

It's pretty obvious from the opening scene where the relationship story is headed but it's not an easy road for us viewers.This movie belongs to Jennifer Westfeldt. She wrote the script directed the movie and stars as the woman who decides to have a baby with her platonic friend Adam Scott. These two are part of a group of six close knit friends in Manhattan who start out doing everything together and telling each other everything. One of the couples Maya Rudolph and Chris O'Dowd announce We're pregnant and promptly move to Brooklyn. The other married couple Jon Hamm Krisen Wiig start out by attempting to break all Guiness records for sex and end up evolving into something a bit less exciting.The two platonic friends decide to beat the system by sharing parenting responsibilities while pursuing separate dating lives until they find the right person. Westfeldt has a Lisa Kudrow quality about her that doesn't play well with me. She was the star and writer of Kissing Jessica Stein and here she comes across as insecure and awkward and not nearly as smart as she would like to believe. Adam Scott brilliant on Parks and Recreation is quite the ladies man and also views himself as smarter than the masses. Westfeldt finds a perfect guy in Edward Burns and Scott finds happiness with Megan Fox. Of course you know where this is headed.What struck me throughout the film was how every scene and every character was just a bit off. Nothing really worked. Jon Hamm has one really nice scene where he is intoxicated and really stirs the pot at a group dinner. Kristen Wiig has very few lines and spends the movie sulking. Maya Rudolph and Chris O'Dowd have a couple of decent scenes but mostly the film has little insight to offer and no characters with whom you would like to connect.".

	schema:headline " Casual Parenting";
	schema:reviewBody "Jason Adam Scott and Julie Jennifer Westfeldt are successful New Yorkers who have been friends since college. They're now in their thirties and are the only two in their circle of friends to have avoided marriage and children. They watch their friends  couples Missy and Ben Kristen Wiig and Jon Hamm and Leslie and Alex Maya Rudolph and Chris O'Dowd  as they become increasingly short tempered and detached from their social lives as they raise their children. They then determine that the pressures of romance and marriage got in the way of being responsible parents. Jason and Julie both want to have a child but at the same time they want to avoid the relationship pitfalls their friends have fallen into. So they come up with the idea of having a child together while simultaneously being free to pursue other relationships.I've heard of casual sex before but casual parenting is a new one on me. It's the basis of Friends with Kids which not only stars Jennifer Westfeldt but was also written and directed by her. On the levels of narrative structure theme and characterization this movie is profoundly wrongheaded. It regards the decision to have a child not as a serious commitment but as the basis of a social experiment. The leads go through the first ninety minutes or so believing they can have their cake and eat it too only for them both to have inevitable dimestore epiphanies about whom they love and what they want out of life. In the middle of all this is their toddler a son named Joe who never asked to be a part of his parents' relationship gameplaying any more than he asked to be born. These people are appalling.Westfeldt develops the lead characters as a pair of witty urban philosophers always with the constant observing and repetitive jabs at their respective love lives. Jason is by far the worse of the two as he spends much of the first hour making sarcastic remarks and crude sexual references especially about breasts and vaginas. Both are such incessant talkers that it's a wonder how Westfeldt found enough paper to print their dialogue on. You hear them gab away caring not about their son or their new partners or even their obligatory revelations about one another you just want them to shut up. The same can be said for the four supporting characters especially the men. Alex in particular has a knack for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time which makes me wonder why Westfeldt tries to pass it off as yet another joke.Into Jason's life enters Mary Jane Megan Fox a dancer and theater actress. She seems to be the perfect match for him apart from her noticeable feminine assets a plus for Jason she's also not looking to have kids and knows how to have the kind of fun Jason likes to have. How can this work with Joe in the picture? Not a problem  Jason simply drops him off at Julie's place. She does the same thing to Jason when she goes on her dates. It must be nice having the luxury to dump your kid off at someone else's house when it best suits you to do so because as we all know that's what parenting is all about. She doesn't fare as well as Jason in the dating department until she meets Kurt Edward Burns a divorce a father and an allaround nice guy. He's probably the only decent character in the entire film.Two people have found their ideal partners. Or have they? Julie eventually begins to wonder if she loves Jason as more than a dear friend and a baby daddy. Indeed the two are intellectually and emotionally compatible but that only deepens the mystery of how their son came into the picture. On the basis of how they were established in the opening scenes neither Julie nor Jason would believably come to the decision to have a baby. They're simply not the parental types. In spite of this Westfeldt depicts them both as loving and attentive parents doting on Joe in every scene they share. This comes off as grossly inauthentic. To an extent it also comes off as cruel. If they love Joe so much why would they be in an open relationship during his formative years? This would only confuse him.As the film nears the end it transitions from an awful alternative parenting comedy to a soppy romantic drama one that hinges on a hopelessly predictable outcome. I wouldn't have minded this so much if the film had been founded on a premise that actually worked. You know me  I give passing grades to romcoms all the time usually when no one else does. There's more to it than my willingness to see them as the fantasies they truly are there's also the fact that by and large such fantasies are harmless goodnatured fun. In the case of Friends with Kids we're dealing with a fantasy one should never indulge in. Parenting is not about working your child into your dating schedule. It's a twentyfour hour a day seven day a week commitment. If that's too much of a sacrifice perhaps you should consider getting a dog. Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

	schema:reviewBody "In this remake of the 1988 Dutch film 'Spoorloos' writer Jeff Harriman Kiefer Sutherland searches for his girlfriend Diane Sandra Bullock who disappeared from a gas station during a road trip they took 3 years earlier.His new girlfriend Nancy Travis tries to help him pick up the pieces of his life but gets increasingly frustrated over his fascination with the mystery. Diane's kidnapper Barney Jeff Bridges has his own interest piqued by Jeff.There still persists the perception that remakes are inferior to originals and that European cinema is artistically superior to Hollywood. This movie is used to illustrate those points. But these are far from the only reasons it flopped.The casting didn't follow the traditional route. It does not impact the quality of the production and should not be counted as negative. But it deflated the commercial appeal by ignoring the superficial tastes of moviegoers.Kiefer Sutherland is an actor audiences more readily accept as a darker character than victimized nice guy Jeff. This is wellevidenced by his critical triumph in the movie 'Freeway' three years later as a kidnappermurderer. At the time he was also mostly seen bolstering ensemble casts rather than as a conventional male lead. His strong performance should have been enough to carry the film and it would have been had there not been other factors.Jeff Bridges was more readily accepted by audiences as a nice guy male lead. He wanted to play a creep for a change and did an impeccable job here. But audiences had to look past over 20 years of typecasting to accept him in the role and most couldn't. As a result one of the finest characterizations in his long distinguished career is overlooked.No actress could have given a more convincing performance than Nancy Travis in the role of Rita the heroine. But audiences liked Sandra Bullock better and have always wanted to see more of her which in this case would have meant giving her the more substantial role of Rita than the tragic role of kidnapped Diane.At the time 199192 preproduction how could anyone know that Sandra Bullock would soon top the box office like few actresses before her? Nancy Travis had been in a string of hits but then littleknown Bullock would surpass her as a star within 18 months of the release of this film. Had they known there can be little doubt Bullock would have played Rita.The ultimate sin that North American film audiences could not forgive is obvious pandering to their own glaring superficial tastes when it comes to how movies end. The 1988 original European version haunted audiences and made them think because of its dark conclusion. That version didn't have a Hollywood ending and that was its payoff  one meant for an entirely different audience.The Hollywood version not only wraps up the conflict between the characters differently rewarding perseverance over intellect good over evil in typical Hollywood tradition it also includes a tackedon whimsical denouement. North American film audiences DO prefer happy endings with neat and tidy closure.But expecting them to embrace the glaring implication that they can't handle scary andor thoughtprovoking material is an unforgivable insult which could only elicit the kind of derision from reviewers that it has even though the action which leads up to it is far from boring or silly. Had the film been an original with a facile and obtuse resolution it would have been accepted if not embraced.Hollywood studios obviously have final approval on the cut released to theatres in most instances. A trick some auteurs can employ when attempting to keep the integrity of a darkerthemed film is to wait until the deadline before delivering the finished product and including two endings. One ending will be the darker one they want. The other will be the happy ending  one shot and cut so badly that the studio will presumably have to go with the darker ending. This ploy might work if studios cared more about the quality of what they were releasing rather than its box office p potential.Then there is the release date  February 1993. What happens in February in Western Culture every year? Valentine's Day! Does this look like a date movie to you? Everything about how this movie was made and marketed invited flop status.As I said the action which leads up to the finale is far from boring or silly. In fact much of it is quite watchable and on par with and in many cases identical to the original. Where it actually improves upon the original is in its addition of a female lead.Rita is much more interesting than Lieneke  the second girlfriend character in the original an incidental character compared with Rita. Affable considerate blessed with work ethic and selfdeprecating modesty truckstop waitress Rita is an unlikely heroine for a Hollywood film.Indeed truckstop waitress is an occupation designed for comic relief or passive anonymity in most Hollywood cinema. A female lead can usually portray one only if her character arc ends in her being beneficiary of an extreme reversal of fortune i.e. marrying a rich dude or becoming a supermodel.Rita doesn't entertain herself with such fantasies but she does have aspirations. When Jeff walks in she remembers him from high school but he doesn't remember her. He pulls out a picture of Diane and asks if she has seen her. Rita says that her mind blots out most of the faces she sees. Yet she remembers him. This is a character that knows what she wants as unromantic as it may seem. This isn't what North Americans look for in movie heroines if you go by box office and surveys. They may live their lives differently and they even may be happy. But they go to movies to see something else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Had I not seen the original Dutch film Spoorloos I might have given The Vanishing more credit. But it's a weak remake which gives American audiences all the gore that the original lacked and a reasonably happy ending which was nowhere to be found in the original. The Vanishing is the story of Jeff whose claustrophobic girlfriend Diane goes missing from a gas station and never returns. For years Jeff is plagued with guilt and never gives up on the search for Diane not even after meeting Rita with whom he begins a serious relationship. But Rita soon becomes sick of Jeff's obsession and leaves him after a bitter confrontation. It is at this point that Jeff's obsession pays off and Barney comes looking for him. Barney knows what happened to Diane because he is the one who kidnapped her. But Barney will only tell Jeff what happened if Jeff agrees to go through everything that Diane went through without knowing in advance what that might be. Jeff agrees and disappears and now it is Rita who is obsessed with discovering what has happened to him.This isn't a terrible film by any means. The performances are great particularly by Keifer Sutherland as Jeff. His portrayal of the guiltridden haunted man is near perfect. There are some great moments of comedy provided by Park Overall as Rita's friend Lynn. But The Vanishing lacks the power of Spoorloos despite a harrowing scene in which Jeff learns the fate of Diane firsthand a scene which is identical to the original. Still I don't understand why when a foreign film is remade for American audiences it is almost always assumed that we want more gore and a happy ending thank you very much. Both cheapen the story in this case. Spoorloos was a film of terrible sorrow and grim reality both of which will or at least SHOULD leave even the most hardened horror fan shaken. The Vanishing is slightly less effective going in for cheap thrills and a kickass finale a la Hollywood. I would recommend seeing it ONLY if you're going to watch Spoorloos as well.".

But Rita soon becomes sick of Jeff's obsession and leaves him after a bitter confrontation. It is at this point that Jeff's obsession pays off and Barney comes looking for him. Barney knows what happened to Diane because he is the one who kidnapped her. But Barney will only tell Jeff what happened if Jeff agrees to go through everything that Diane went through without knowing in advance what that might be. Jeff agrees and disappears and now it is Rita who is obsessed with discovering what has happened to him.This isn't a terrible film by any means. The performances are great particularly by Keifer Sutherland as Jeff. His portrayal of the guiltridden haunted man is near perfect. There are some great moments of comedy provided by Park Overall as Rita's friend Lynn. But The Vanishing lacks the power of Spoorloos despite a harrowing scene in which Jeff learns the fate of Diane firsthand a scene which is identical to the original. Still I don't understand why when a foreign film is remade for American audiences it is almost always assumed that we want more gore and a happy ending thank you very much. Both cheapen the story in this case. Spoorloos was a film of terrible sorrow and grim reality both of which will or at least SHOULD leave even the most hardened horror fan shaken. The Vanishing is slightly less effective going in for cheap thrills and a kickass finale a la Hollywood. I would recommend seeing it ONLY if you're going to watch Spoorloos as well.";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie not knowing it was a remake of Spoorloos 1988. It wasn't until reading about the two movies on IMDb that I realized there was a difference in the endings. Saying that here's my viewing experience The movie started off well. I got involved with the characters though I thought Diane Sandra Bullock was a whiny bitch and I probably would have done the same thing Jeff Kiefer Sutherland does in the beginning when the car stalls in tunnel. Anyway they do come across as a believable couple. I really think Jeff Daniels did an excellent job as Barney and the haircut clothing and mannerisms were perfect for this role. Nancy Travis was serviceable as Rita.By now everybody knows the story so I won't belabor that point. But to me the high point was the confrontation between Jeff and Rita once Rita discovers Jeff is still obsessed with finding Diane. Great scene with great acting and a totally believable revelation from Jeff that his obsession isn't about still being in love with Diane it's about not knowing what happened to her. BIG SPOILER ALERT  The ending to me was very predictable very typical and very weak. Again I had not and still have not seen the original. But I'm sitting there watching this and I'm going OK Rita is gonna save the day and everything will be fine. Because that's what happens in these types of movies. And that's exactly what happens and it's terrible because it's unbelievable. If Rita is this damn smart why is she just a waitress at a coffee shop? Moving on my thoughts were that this movie would carry much more impact if it had ended with Jeff awakening in the coffin knowing he was buried alive and a slow fade away shot of Barney Cousins eating a solitary meal at his cabin with Rita having no idea what happened because she had left Jeff earlier that day forever.Course I then read on IMDb that's how the original ended more or less. Now I'm off to find a copy of the original and compare it to this. Ciao.".

A fresh eye can see problems that had previously escaped attention possibly because one was too close to the work to see even obvious defects.This certainly applies to filmmakers. Very few have the chance to completely remake the whole thing from start to finish. But this was the opportunity presented to Dutch filmmaker Georges Sluizer when US producers approached him to create a new English language version of his acclaimed film The Vanishing or Spoorloos to give it the correct Dutch title a unique opportunity to improve on the original.Did he succeed? To judge from nearly all the critics the answer is a resounding no. The Hollywood version is dismissed as a poor imitation of the original at best and a total travesty at worst. Is the criticism justified or is it just a snobby attitude that automatically assumes European cultural superiority over Hollywood crassness or did Sluizer sacrifice the integrity he had brought to the first version? The producers felt that American audiences would not accept the ending as it stood. As a result the film received the most formulaic of endings destroying the mood and underlying creepiness that made the original so disturbing.Jeff Bridges character Barney Cousins begins by experimenting with chloroform to see how long it takes to render someone unconscious. Bridges plays Barney as an eccentric character  far more mannered than his opposite number in the Dutch version played by BernardPierre Donnadieu.A young couple enters the story Jeff Harriman and Diane Shaver played by Keifer Sutherland and Sandra Bullock.

Jeff's need to know overrides all else and he agrees. He awakens to find himself buried alive the fate that befell Diane. And that is where things were left in the original  an uncompromisingly bleak ending.Not so in the remake.The last part of The Vanishing is not only changed physically but also symbolically from the harrowing ending of Sluizer's original. In fact the ending is no longer harrowing it's just predictable and pedestrian.The new version has Rita arriving in the nick of time to save Jeff. The film ends on a lighthearted note when Rita and Jeff both refuse a cup of coffee having given up the beverage after experiencing Barney's thermos of laced coffee.Sluizer must have felt compelled to accept an ending that was so standard and safe that good work generated in other areas of the remake went for nothing  but maybe it all goes back to the decision to redo it in the first place if it ain't broke don't fix it.".

The film ends on a lighthearted note when Rita and Jeff both refuse a cup of coffee having given up the beverage after experiencing Barney's thermos of laced coffee.Sluizer must have felt compelled to accept an ending that was so standard and safe that good work generated in other areas of the remake went for nothing  but maybe it all goes back to the decision to redo it in the first place if it ain't broke don't fix it.";

I know it is almost 2013 and I just saw the movie but is was worth watching.The reason I rate this movie low is because I think Hollywood had thrown their own juice on Krabbs original story and that just did not work out well. In the original story the story ends where Kiefer us buried. In this movie such an ending did not work because it ain't happy. So the makers of this movie invented a second girlfriend in the story. So at first I thought Bridges would kidnap her too and would like to mess up Kiefer's mind but he didn't. That would have been the perfect juice on Krabbs story. But they didn't! So I stay with my opinion and that's if you want to make a movie based on a book stay true to the original story of the book and don't create something of your own because of the lack of inventing a whole new story by yourself.".

I have also seen the original and like it very much however I totally disagree calling the American version as pure s. I think The Vanishing is as good as the original or even better especially Jeff Bridges as Barney is incredible which alone makes it worth to watch this movie. And there are quiet many people who agree to me and think that this a good thriller for sure not perfect but very exciting all in all intelligent and interesting. To those of you who permanently try to compare it to Spoorlos and who seem to be so disappointed I can only say what did you expect? How could George Sluizer make you feel satisfied when he directed The Vanishing in 1993? I would agree it's a typical Hollywood thriller but it's a good one if you tried to regard it more individually I would suppose you to agree. I mean I only think it's a pity that those who haven't seen this movie and might be interested to watch it get such an underrated opinion of it just because some of you are showing their personal disgust to Hollywood remakes in a such a low way. I also use to enjoy Europeen cinema very much. Generally prefer it to so called blockbusters from Hollywood. But this remake is great and deserves a better vote. I give it a 9 and at least some of those who watched this movie should agree. Everyone who is able to comment movies without prejudices should be able to diversify The Vanishing from real crap giving it at least a 5 or a 6 even if he or she doesn't like it so very much.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes I know the Dutch original Spoorloos by the same director is supposedly far superior but since I haven't as yet found or seen it I can only comment on the American remake. It is definitely the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. Jeff Sutherland and Diane Bullock in a tooshort role stop at a rest area while on vacation. She goes in to buy drinks and he never sees her again. Three years later he meets someone new Nancy Travis but is still obsessed with finding Diane. After he goes on TV and pleads for information you kind of wonder why he hasn't done this earlier or why there seem to be no other family members looking for her but I guess these are irrelevant questions the kidnapper Barney Jeff Bridges contacts him.Along with Jeff we gradually come to realize what happened to Diane and we are effectively sickened and saddened. Let me say that the beauty of this film is that other than the kidnapping we are never shown what happens to Diane only what Barney makes Jeff experience. Knowing it but not seeing it except as what happens to Jeff is powerfully haunting. And for Sandy fans the scene in which Jeff returns to the area where Diane disappeared and envisions her again makes this film worth seeing for that alone. Sutherland is brilliant and Bullock is at her most exquisitely beautiful. I burst into tears at this haunting and moving scene.Having said all that Jeff Bridges' odd accent is annoying and just plain weird. Is it supposed to be Dutch? No explanation given. In any case I am now unable to see Jeff Bridges in anything without feeling sick. BIG SPOILER Also have you ever noticed how in movies it's light outside late at night even in a forest? This is what conveniently enables Rita to dig up Jeff from his burial spot and Jeff to see Diane's grave actually a nice touch there even though in reality it would be pitch black out there. Despite these and other minor flaws I liked this film. To sum up I'm ambivalent about recommending this movie since it is so disturbing and absolutely not for kids or even teens but if you an adult enjoy feeling creeped out for a good long while rent this one. And I'd still like to find the original version.".

I have seen in the last years.Where the original is chilling and brilliant the remake is flat and even boring especially the happy end finale takes away what little suspense there was in this film in the first place.While such a distortion especially grafting a happy end which wasn't there previously is quite frequently the case in Hollywood remakes of European arthouse movies and could've been expected the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that this inane mess was created by the very same filmmaker who did the original Spoorloos...Why Mr. Sluizer decided to ruin his masterpiece in such a fashion is beyond me.Avoid this abomination at all cost as it might spoil the original for you even if watched after that let alone the other way round...";

Michael Caine is a pompous hasbeen running a production of Richard III  updated to Nazi occupation one of the few genuine laughs a satirical jab at Ian McKellen in which everyone is forever doing the Hitler salute every time they take the stage. Convincing Dylan that acting should be a conceptual act unto itself the two plot to steal money from some fairly harmless gangsters by way of their acting prowess. Confusion ensues both on screen and in the audience there's a romantic subplot between Dylan and the daughter of one of the gangsters blah blah blah and Dylan gets to dress in odd clothes and do funny accents. Michael Caine delivers some choice lines and Dylan's comic timing is on the money so why isn't it any good? It does have a certain charm that you would expect from Film 4 but it also has a precocious little girl acting as compass in a muddled and irrelevant plot  a nono in screen writing 101. Exposition overshadows everything else. You just want to see Moran and Caine acting as comic foil to each other the way the were at the beginning but when they're together toward the end the the pairing has lost its charisma.The Actors is an amusing albeit underwhelming effort.

	schema:headline " Soso comedy film that lacks laughs but has a reasonable plot";
	schema:reviewBody "Anthony O'Malley is an old actor who has long since said goodbye to his best days. A lacklustre performance in a terrible version of Richard III that nobody wants to see. One of his support cast is the unsuccessful and jobbing actor Tom who is equally in need of some form or career or income boost. In order to help develop his villain O'Malley has been hanging around a rough pub in the docks with a criminal called Barreller and in doing so he has learnt that Barreller owes another party money  a party he does not know. So O'Malley makes a proposition to Tom  that Tom will present himself as an agent for this other party collect the money and split it with O'Malley. The first act is simple and well executed but quickly the two find themselves getting deeper into lies.At the time of release I must confess that the trailer did nothing to make me want to see this but by the time the television premier rolled around I had forgotten this and decided to tune in for the presence of Dylan Moran whom I find very funny in certain things. Sadly this was not one of them and laughs were pretty thin on the ground throughout. So instead I settled into the plot which at first seemed to offer some interesting scenarios before quickly collapsing into a series of disguises and unconvincing ideas that don't really work. It isn't bad per se but it certainly isn't any good. It produced enough forward movement and amusing ideas to hold my interest but it rarely did anything to justify doing so and I was generally disappointed with the fact that it failed to do much.The characters are not that well developed and the sort of pathos I hoped would add value to the material and there isn't that much for the actors to work with. This lack of depth means Michael Caine can't do much with his character and has no laughs to help him out  thus seeing him finally dressed as a woman is yet another low in a career of highs and lows. Moran struggles with the lack of good comedy to work with but still makes a good fist of his various characters and is amusing if not funny. Gambon collects his check and turns in an average performance while Headey looks sexy but doesn't have much else to do. Iverson also lacks material but she gives a nice performance and avoids being an annoying cute kid type of actor.Overall this is a fairly average film that offers some fun early on but generally just becomes messy and poorly delivery the more it goes on. The cast are soso mainly because they lack the laughs Moran or the depth Caine that they needed to turn in good work. It all does enough to be watchable but it doesn't do anything particularly well.".

It does have a romantic subplot but it isn't central enough to call this a romantic film. I should also say that some of the material involving Dolores towards the end is dodgey for 15 year olds and this should really be considered Xrated. In the states it's a 17cert R rating not a 15 as in the UK.I liked the throwaway ending but though I wanted to enjoy the film really I did too much of it was neither funny nor entertaining.

He tried too hard playing for laughs probably thinking that if retaining the characteristics from his Black Books character would work here.Sadly it backfired. The gags fell flat after awhile and then he became just an irritation.

It was great to see Morans range as an actor as he plays several different made up characters during the film. I would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in comedy  as it represents a fresh quirky and inventive turn in Irish feature length chuckle films. I laughed a lot. what more could you ask for?".

This is a dull 'comedy' that sees Michael Caine and Dylan Moran try and pull off a wellplanned hustle where Moran must imitate a London gangland boss whose arrival is imminent to collect a sizable sum of cash from local kingpin Michael Gambon. The rest is simply a forgettable romp that is thankfully over quite quickly. Moran is mildly amusing in places but on this evidence is better suited to life on the small screen in hit comedies such as Black Books. Caine is unchallenged in his role and gives a steady performance without being overstretched. One can only imagine what made him sign up for this movie  it can't even have been a summer in Dublin given that many of the scenes look positively autumnal in the background. Gambon actually steals the show and anyone who has caught some of his performances in the likes of Have I Got News For You will know that he is a wonderfully funny man. But overall the result is disappointing and it seems a lifetime ago that Neil Jordan was making quality movies of the likes of Mona Lisa.".

He never fails to be both hilarious and convincing in all of his varied disguises. He also manages to radiate a sweet charm that belies his outrageous pratfalls. Special mention must also go to Michael Gambon who plays for laughs with a brilliantly accurate and yet comedic inner city Dublin accent. The only weak link is Caine who while obviously having a great laugh hamming it up plays the least interesting and most unsympathetic character. It probably won't play that well overseas but it's well worth a watch all the same.".

The characters of Caine and Moron are insufficiently dumb.The single most annoying thing about this unfunny collection of scenes is the little girl. Only a truly horrible writer would think that to spice up a lousy script it's wise to include a superintelligent wiseass kid. Smarta kids aren't even funny to Bill Cosby fans any more.

Love With the Proper Stranger is always a favorite and I'm irresistibly hooked on repeated viewing.Natalie Wood is the feisty young working woman struggling for her chance to be independent to live away from the family attached Italian parents and brothers in NYC setting and be on her own terms. Steve McQueen is the center of opposite attraction the problem and the goal. He is a union musician who is trying to be financially independent he also has close family ties with both endearing mother and father. Edie Adams is in a supporting role as McQueen's girl friend with an apartment to lean on. Tom Bosley is the kind and goodhearted suitor that Wood's character's family approves. It's a heartwarming very much a 60's love story that touches on the tough subject of abortion yet brims with humor drama and affectionate smiles. Shot in black and white music by Elmer Bernstein with the theme song sung by Jack Jones produced by Alan J. Pakula the film is keen and sensitively directed by Robert Mulligan. His films include the award winning 1962 To Kill A Mockingbird the intriguingly haunting 1972 The Other an unforgettably fun 1961 Come September with Gina Lollobrigida  Rock Hudson Sandra Dee  Bobby Darin in Italy the 1971 classic coming of age film The Summer of '42 with lovely Jennifer O'Neill and another poignant coming of age story from a girl's point of view in 1991 The Man In the Moon with Reese Witherspoon in her impressive film debut.".

His films include the award winning 1962 To Kill A Mockingbird the intriguingly haunting 1972 The Other an unforgettably fun 1961 Come September with Gina Lollobrigida  Rock Hudson Sandra Dee  Bobby Darin in Italy the 1971 classic coming of age film The Summer of '42 with lovely Jennifer O'Neill and another poignant coming of age story from a girl's point of view in 1991 The Man In the Moon with Reese Witherspoon in her impressive film debut.";

But Steve McQueen is the real sweet part of this couple.  He is corrupt and funny and unsuspectedly tender and responsible and caring.  It should be noted for the fact that it marked his departure from the antihero roles that he specialized in and excelled in.  This wasn't an action movie but it was one of Steve's absolute best performances.

The story of a good workingclass Italian girl in New York who getspregnant by a man she hardly knows is very strong stuff for 1963. So is their decision to have an abortion.  Roe vs. Wade was nearlya decade in the future.  Mulligan shows a very gritty dirty New Yorkwhich has emerged from the 50s as a crumbling relic of a citynowhere as clean and shiny as it is today.  McQueen is a callowyoung musician not looking to settle down with anyone let alone asingle pregnant girl even if he is at fault.  The trip to a bad neighborhood to get the abortion is chilling andWood's absolute terror is genuine here.  McQueen beingreluctantly honorable is very sexy here.  The rest of the film with herfacing down her overly protective Neanderthal brothers and gettingher own apartment follows the young lovers as they try to do theright thing.  Steve's posterBetter wed than Dead is a sweetcoda.  I loved this movie.  It struck this teenager at the time as a verysophisticated film.  Natalie Wood is incandescently beautiful inblack and white and still the loner McQueen's intensity is a bitmore subtle than usual.  Good supporting cast.

BW works well to emphasize the New York atmosphere of the flick with its many locale shots. The ethnic Italian ethos is wellcaptured too. And to top it off is a wonderful score by Elmer Bernstein whose music veers awfully close to sounding like that other Bernstein and that's not a criticism!.

I loved the way Natalie used her eyes to speak and how Steve did the same.My only regret is that neither of them are with us today.I will have to see if this has come out on DVD.

The abortion scene brought tears to my eyes as it was so REAL There were so many underlying themes intersecting all at once First for Natalie Woods character  it was clear that she was hell bent on taking control of her life and her future and that meant ending the pregnancy...and yet there was no denying the strong bond she felt with Steve McQueens rebellious player character I always feel sorry for women who fall for guys like this!!!!!!  she wondered Could it work? But then reality slaps her in the face and her steely resolve returns...and also she's got to be scared to death just for the physical invasion she is about to endure under such circumstances.And then complicating the matter even further was Steve's character waiting outside the door for her to finish the procedure  he too was clearly experiencing many conflicting emotions all at once of course being a player with no plans for being tied down he was relieved she was taking care of it. And yet  like Natalies character he was strangely drawn to this woman he had only really known for less than a day  could it be love? Could it be REAL? I have rarely seen such genuine passion in a film as the scene where he bursts in grabs Natalie and when she falls into his arms sobbing he whispers I would kill them before they hurt you. Not a dry eye in the house I'm sure. What a moment. Adding to the poignancy is the fact that both of these fine actors died in the live fastdie young category of Hollywood actors  making it all seem that much more touching.The second half of the movie became more typical but that's OK. Please Hollywood  let us say once again They DO make movies like that AGAIN!".

That said I knew of its reputation as one of the best showcases for both McQueen and costar Natalie Wood she even received an Oscar nod for her work here  and I certainly agree going so far as to say that they were probably never better. In essence this is MARTY 1955 for a younger and more reckless generation though the protagonists in this case are anything but dogs  demonstrating the same feeling for the place New York and a particular section of its people Italian immigrants. The narrative accompanied by a lovely yet sturdy Elmer Bernstein score basically resolves itself in a series of extended scenes set in domestic working or urban environments  with the most unusual being the opening sequence at a ballroomcumemployment agency where musician McQueen hustles his way to the odd engagement and later when he and Wood hide from her overprotective brothers inside his family's dilapidated dwelling where Jack Jones is even briefly heard crooning the film's title tune. In this respect plaudits must go to Arnold Schulman's exceptional Oscarnominated script it is no coincidence that his name atypically precedes even that of the supporting cast! Incidentally while I included the film among my Drama viewing involving after all the attempt to abort an unwanted pregnancy borne of a onenight stand it features almost as much comedy  that being just as wellobserved adds another layer to the intended realism. Wood's relationship with her possessive family is especially entertaining but also her efforts to dodge and later withstand gawky admirer Tom Bosley in an impressive debut  whose equivalent in McQueen's life is played by Edie Adams the former in fact has no qualms about taking 'new' girlfriend Wood to her flat while she is away at work! Also though the latter stages descend into repetitive confrontations between the stars this does eventually pay off in a hilarious finale  with McQueen deciding to conform to Wood's idealized view of love even if it means embarrassing himself in public rather than lose her. In conclusion I had tried to get hold of this one back in January to be included in my planned retrospective to commemorate the recently deceased Mulligan while that attempt did not pan out at the time I happened again upon it just this week obviously managing now to acquire a copy of the film for the record I still have a couple more of the director's efforts to check out both also delayed for some reason from that initial tribute i.e. THE GREAT IMPOSTOR 1961 and BLOODBROTHERS 1978.".

	schema:headline " A very nice Natalie Wood vehicle";
	schema:reviewBody "Love With The Proper Stranger is a romantic comedy with some very serious undertones. It basically tells the story of the result of a one night stand where a girl becomes pregnant and the chap responsible is forced to deal with the situation. At the time the themes of unmarried pregnancy and backstreet abortions were pretty shocking stuff. To today's audiences this sort of stuff is now covered without a seconds thought in daytime soap operas so it might be difficult appreciating the daring qualities of this production. However the scenes where Natalie Wood visit's the abortion 'clinic' are still fairly grim. It has to be said that they sit relatively uncomfortably within the movie as a whole as the tone otherwise is mainly lighthearted with quite a bit of comic interplay between the various characters. In my opinion it doesn't damage the film however as it gives it a little bit of an edge and helps add our sympathies to Wood's character. It does have to be said that despite the presence of Steve McQueen this is undoubtedly Natalie Wood's film. She is the heart and soul of the production and it's hardly surprising that she was nominated for an Oscar off the back of this. Although quite how McQueen's character could forget having a liaison with someone like Natalie Wood is a little mystifying is he insane? Anyway generally speaking McQueen is forced to take a back seat in this film but he is good nonetheless. The film also boasts a fine comic appearance by Happy Days regular Tom Bosley. Quite amusingly he even looked middleaged way back then! On the downside the film does seem to end perhaps too abruptly it gave the impression that the filmmakers had ran out of their allocated time and just wanted to wrap things up quickly. This is however a very minor complaint.Love With The Proper Stranger is a quality romanticdrama with comic moments. It's a nice showcase of 60's New York with a lush score accompanying it. However at the end of the day I would recommend it mostly for Natalie Wood. I thought she was terrific.".

Natalie Wood as Angie Rossini and Steve McQueen as Rocky Papasano are an infectious team. As the film opens Ms. Wood is tracking Mr. McQueen down to ask for help in obtaining an abortion. McQueen seems to have forgotten the dalliance with Wood blame it on the scotch.Watch for a brief moment when McQueen looks Wood up and down in their first onscreen scene this is perhaps when McQueen recalls her and the point at which he begins to fall in love with her character as the sexual attraction had already reached culmination. McQueen's realization is long and confused but Wood visibly falls in love with McQueen while watching him interact with his parents. In this case disposing with the initial sexual attraction has made the characters' romance more interesting. This is difficult to play so convincingly and the lead performances along with the direction of Robert Mulligan are awardworthy.The dramatic highlight will be obvious the comic highlight is the scene with Wood having dinner with Tom Bosley as Anthony Columbo's family. This scene works so well because it both parallels and contrasts Wood's earlier meeting with McQueen's family when she fell in love with him. Mr. Bosley heads up a strong supporting cast. Arnold Schulman's script and the Milton R. Krasner photography are also outstanding. The unworthy last act is disappointing but not damning.

However I think anyone can enjoy this strange lovestory. I simply adore this movie. My friends were turned off because it is in black and white however the story is so engrossing that after a while the lack of color is unnoticeable. The back of the movie is brief and most plot summaries are too. However this movie is amazing. I watched it four times the weekend I rented it and when I had to return it went out and bought it. Steve McQueen is called one of Hollywood's most legendary actors. He is remembered for his car chase in Bullit and motorcycle chase in The Great Escape. Although these movies are both truly perfect examples of McQueen's talent as an actor and speed demon Love with the Proper Stranger should not be forgotten. It displays his softer side as well as his talent purely as an actor. A lot of actors are limited to certain type of movie. McQueen crosses the action figure genre with ease. His great looks and wonderful voice are just bonuses for us obsessed fans. I will admit sometimes I am drawn to movies by an actor's superficial appeals but McQueen is an amazing actor as well as a hottie. His character is perfectly developed and the use of facial expressions are so appropriate. For example when talking to Angie Wood he will often just smile and then drop it when she disapproves.Natalie Wood is as great as she ever has been. Her passionate character is not overdone. She is real and strong. She is not some dumb girl in most love stories just caught up in charm. She uses her head and then her heart. I know that sounds cliched. Her lines are not awkward. Every line in this movie is perfectly placed and none are inappropriate. Her character is not singlelayered. However she develops over the course of the movie. It is obvious in her outward appearance as well as her decisions. She received an Academy Award nomination for her performance and should have won too. The story addresses some issues too about love abortion and family. It does not come across as too heavy and then again not too light for the subject matter. Each is perfectly addressed. This movie is also not without humor. Lines like we are in love aren't we? Yes you with yourself and me with myself are both humorous and revealing. And the entire youknow... dinner conversation e.g. broke her you know legs is entirely entertaining. Overall McQueen and Wood deliver amazing performances and the story is just beautiful I can't think of a more suitable word. So no matter what you may have heard this movie was the best rental selection I have ever made.".

I never dismissed Casablanca as dated because it happened to take place in 1941 a time when even this old geezer didn't yet exist. Now why would I do that?This month's tcm star of the month being Natalie Wood viewers were treated to a fascinating introduction by Wood's former husband Robert Wagner and her daughter Natasha Gregson Wagner who was raised by Wagner since infancy. I very much appreciated their special personal rapport and their inside knowledge regarding the making of this film as well as the two other films shown on the same night Splendor in the Grass and West Side Story.The success of this movie brilliantly directed by Robert Mulligan To Kill a Mockingbird revolved around the highly engaging interaction between the two main actors Natalie Wood as Macy's salesperson Angie Rossini and Steve McQueen as musician Rocky Papasano but I don't think that their performances would have been as alluring without a very intelligent and complex script as written by Arnold Schulman. Another vital element of the film's appeal was the outstanding supporting cast especially Tom Bosley as an awkward lovestricken restaurateur Hershel Bernardi as Angie's possessive produce pushing brother and Edie Adams as an exotic dancer who also serves as Rocky's roommate of the moment. Portraying their characters as victims of intense personal crisis both Wood and McQueen very credibly project an entire spectrum of feelings that convey their general state of extreme confusion and frustration. I especially appreciated how McQueen developed his character from unlikable to sympathetic in the course of the film often employing his entire body in the process and how Wood enabled us to share the wide range of emotions that Angie endured at a time of severe inner turmoil. The scene of her initial attempt at leaving the only home that she had ever known for better or for worse should hit home with anyone who had experienced a similar situation in their lives including myself. Bravo Natalie. Loved the clothes hanging out of the hastily packed suitcase. Nice touch.Without fatally destroying the end of this movie for anyone who has never seen it I was still left guessing how it would end until the very last scene. Even though the ending had its corny aspect we need to accept the time as the dawn of the protest movement so the final scene may have had a very different impact on an audience back in 1963 than it does in 2016. I still loved the final resolution. It actually brought tears to my hopelessly sentimental eyes. How about you?".

	schema:reviewBody "changes horses in midstream from a drama to a kind of farce...but that's not a complaint both aspects are welldone and the change is not jarring. Mulligan's direction is simple and honest and uncluttered by gimmicks. Some observations The young men in the film all speak with a characteristic dees dems and dose style ItalianAmerican Brooklynese and the older generation all speak with stereotypical 1st generation Italian accents. However Angie's accent is almost nonexistent. Certainly not like Marisa Tomei's in My Cousin Vinny. Had she had a thicker accent I think her character would have been less sympathetic...funny how those accents cause one to categorize people. And consequently Angie comes off like the most intelligent person in the film.Another minor annoyance if Rocky and Angie had their onenight stand in the summer as he mentions and the action takes place sometime in the fall they are shivering with the cold while waiting outside in one scene...it seems inconsistent that she would still have an ittybitty waist emphasized by the black dress and apron at the end of the movie considering she must be at least 34 months pregnant. I do love this movie and I watch it whenever I see it playing.".

Mulligan's direction is simple and honest and uncluttered by gimmicks. Some observations The young men in the film all speak with a characteristic dees dems and dose style ItalianAmerican Brooklynese and the older generation all speak with stereotypical 1st generation Italian accents. However Angie's accent is almost nonexistent. Certainly not like Marisa Tomei's in My Cousin Vinny. Had she had a thicker accent I think her character would have been less sympathetic...funny how those accents cause one to categorize people. And consequently Angie comes off like the most intelligent person in the film.Another minor annoyance if Rocky and Angie had their onenight stand in the summer as he mentions and the action takes place sometime in the fall they are shivering with the cold while waiting outside in one scene...it seems inconsistent that she would still have an ittybitty waist emphasized by the black dress and apron at the end of the movie considering she must be at least 34 months pregnant. I do love this movie and I watch it whenever I see it playing.";

It is after that situation the story changes and becomes much lighter and you see two people falling for one another and wanting to resist it to a certain degree.It is definitely evocative of the early sixties and so intriguing.

	schema:reviewBody "Sweet but cynical this Robert Mulligan film seems strangely modern despite its slightly dated plot illegal backalley abortions thank goodness that's something we no longer have to worry about. Natalie Wood scoring her third and final Oscar nomination and Steve McQueen in their only onscreen pairing shine in their realistic touching portrayals as two working class ItalianAmericans who find themselves in a dilemma after a onenight stand. Angie Wood is pregnant and Rocky McQueen attempts to help her to pay for termination of the unwanted pregnancy. Things don't go as planned and he finds himself in the middle of a conflict between Angie and her protective brother Dominick Hershal Bernardi when Angie refuses to marry him. Although the viewer knows that they are right for each other the pair maintain a defiance against the attraction refusing to give into romanticism which could have turned the film into a forgettable sappy love story. Their naturalistic and cynical views on love and marriage give this movie the bite and redeeming qualities that keeps it afloat. Strikingly photographed in black and white against the gritty New York backdrop with wonderful elegant but simple costumes by Edith Head Wood and McQueen both give perhaps the best performances of their careers. Bernardi as Angie's overprotective brother is a lovable annoyance while Tom Bosley as Angie's wouldbe suitor Columbo brings an endearing comic relief clumsy! and his sisters and that mother of his  classic Italian mama! The same can be said for Angie's occasionally hysterical traditional guiltinducing mother  Go and be a mother in America! Day and night you watch her day and night! You take her here you meet her there you wait all day afraid that some lunatic might grab her in the street! Or my personal favorite Yes in my grave I'm going to rest! Edie Adams billed third but in a rather small but showy role is fantastic as the showgirl Barb in her classic early 60s apartment and her little doggies  great reaction expression when she finds Angie using her shower!Gently scored by Elmer Bernstein the little radio rendition we briefly hear in the warehouse sequence I could fall in love with the proper stranger if I heard the bells and banjos ring . . . . . . . which gives the plot another boost letting the leads subtly spark off one another as they discuss the clich of love. Oh how they build things up  in the books and all the movies  'how the world comes to an end the moment your lips touch mine'  how they brainwash you. Natalie's large luminous eyes draw the viewer in as does Steve's toughguy vulnerability which Angie exposes with her charming line You know if you didn't try so hard to play against it you could be a pretty decent kind of a person.Love does win out in a rather unconventional but fabulous climax  it's utterly right and I'm amazed that this film is becoming difficult to find and has never really gotten the recognition it deserves. A DVD print needs to be commercially available  VHS copies seem to be disappearing.And remember  better wed than dead!".

Other reviewers have noted that this was before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973.I agree with those reviewers who say that this may be Natalie Wood's finest performance. She does a superb job at Angie Rossini going through a range of emotions and stages. Steve McQueen is Rocky Papesano and he does very well in an atypical role. The supporting cast all give very good performances as well. Edie Adams is especially good as Barbie and Penny Santon is very good as Mama Rossini.Judging from reviews I've read it's clear that different people will view a twist in this plot differently. That has to do with the hero rescuing the heroine from a planned abortion. The title is interesting. Love with the Proper Stranger seems to say that if one picks the right person or type of person for an affair even a one night stand it will lead to love marriage and a life together. In the case of the woman the man will stand by her protect her and fall for her. In the case of the man he will find her attractive be drawn to her and fall for her.

That is another man who loves the girl wants to marry her and will tell his relatives that he is the father of the child. This all may seem strange in the 21st century especially to younger people. In a society that has few taboos or restrictions on sex and that espouses equality of gender traits choice and tolerance  in such a society the timehonored mores of responsibility honor sacrifice and fidelity may seem strange indeed.This film deserved the five nominations it received for Academy Awards.".

Of course the way to parenthood is not just happy and joyful so the film also realistically portrays the unglamorous side of expecting mothers. Some of these are presented as crude toilet humour while others are presented as emotional rollercoasters that will touch your heart. I like the fact that characters in What to Expect When You're Expecting do not have a smooth breezy path but face adversity like in real life. It is an interesting comedy for expecting mothers.".

Out of all of the mega cast movies of late this is indeed the weakest of all of them. This movie is meant to be a comedy but I didn't laugh once or even come remotely close to laughing the cast some if which are rather talented never get a chance to prove themselves as every scene is so ridiculously short and the script talk about a cheese overload and this is written by Shauna Cross who wrote a terrifically funny script for Whip It it's a shame none of the heart wit and humor that was in that could transfer to this film.The one saving grace this film has is the always wonderful Anna Kendrick her character is the only one worth mentioning and one particular scene of hers nearly brought me to tears she's honestly the only person to stand out in this movie in fact the storyline between Anna and Chace Crawford would probably make a good film on it's own without having to compete for screen time with 4 other plot lines I'm sure Anna's next movie will leave this as a distant memory.Honestly I just can't even explain how silly this movie is it's best to just see it and surely you will see for yourself. Just wait for the DVD giving birth is probably less painful than watching this. Mega thumbs down.".

Other than that this is all pure middleclass Hollywood pretty slick lighthearted but with enough sweetandsour moments to make it feel like it's actually about something. Obviously at the end of the day it's all rather forgettable and it's actually a great shame because the acting talent a shown here is impressive surprisingly even Jennifer Lopez showcases a nuanced performance unlike much we'd seen before both directing and editing are potentially quite skilled at doing what they do and the few good moments here and there give you a little glimpse of what it could have been.The main problem is that the film is just not funny enough to be able to be a crowd pleaser and looses itself among the too many subplots some of which are way off the main subject to be able to become a classic the golf cart chase sequence is one of the lowest and unfunny points and the father group sequences despite Chris Rock are just too indulgent over the top and long.

	schema:headline " Another SelfHelp Book Gets the Romcom Treatment";
	schema:reviewBody "What to Expect When You're Expecting is another unfortunate example of what happens when real selfhelp book advice is applied to the plot of a romantic comedy. Having just a few weeks ago suffered through the joyless Think Like a Man we have yet again a strained unfocused badly developed relationship farce that focuses more on slapstick gags and verbal jabs than on genuinely funny scenarios. This is a shame because I have no doubt that pregnancy and parenthood can in fact be quite funny  that is in the hands of filmmakers who have a deeper understanding of actual people. There is virtually no truth to any of the characters in this movie. They're more like byproducts from a particularly bad sitcom pilot. A select few are so bizarre and shockingly out of place that they seem to have been transported from an alternate universe.Taking place in mostly in Atlanta the film takes cues from recent romcoms like Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve by dividing itself into several interconnecting vignettes. All of them feature couples on the verge of having a baby. There's Jules Cameron Diaz a trainer on a weightloss reality show obviously modeled after The Biggest Loser and her boyfriend Evan Matthew Morrison a dancer on a reality show obviously modeled after Dancing with the Stars. The two met when Jules was the celebrity contestant. Although she's pregnant her cando attitude motivates her to continue as a trainer. It also inflates her superiority complex as she believes only she knows what's best for her baby. The biggest argument she and Evan have is over whether or not their son should be circumcised. Discover for yourself who's for it and who's against it.There's Wendy Elizabeth Banks the owner of a baby boutique who has just published a kids book on breastfeeding and her husband Gary Ben Falcone who was once a contestant on Jules' weight loss show. Wendy is not feeling the glow of pregnancy she's constantly in some kind of physical pain and because her hormones are all out of whack she has become overly emotional. Gary is constantly in competition with his father a former racecar driver named Ramsey Dennis Quaid. As it turns out Ramsey's new wife a much younger woman named Skyler Brooklyn Decker is pregnant with twins. Even in the advanced stages of her pregnancy Skyler remains gorgeous and unburdened with physical ailments such as a weak bladder swollen ankles and an aching back. It's almost as if she's showing off to Wendy.There's Holly Jennifer Lopez a freelance photographer who specializes in baby portraits and her husband Alex Rodrigo Santoro a music producer. Unable to conceive they decide to adopt a baby from Ethiopia. Alex isn't sure he's ready to be a father. Seeking advice he becomes privy to a secretive band of dads known as The Dudes Chris Rock Thomas Lennon Amir Talai and Rob Huebel who walk around pushing strollers and carrying infants in baby slings. Their two rules of conduct are 1 Whatever The Dudes talk about must stay between them and 2 there can be no judging each other for the stuff that just happens to their kids. In other words no squealing about obvious signs of parental irresponsibility. For some unknown reason all four of them idolize a musclebound jogger named Davis Joe Manganiello who wows them every time he does shirtless pullups.The single weakest subplot features two young food truck owners locked in a turf war. This would be Rosie Anna Kendrick and Marco Chace Crawford. It's a reunion of sorts they dated in high school although Marco's reputation as a player repeatedly got in the way. Decency prevents me from giving away too much of this subplot although I will say that given the fact that this film is supposed to be about the ups and downs of traditional pregnancy these characters stick out like a sore thumb. They would have been much better off in a film devoted entirely to their relationship  provided of course that it was left in the capable hands of intelligent filmmakers.All the births happen on the same night and in the same hospital. I can't begrudge the director or screenwriters a little dramatic license. I can however blame them for allowing drastic shifts in tone just when we think it's all about desperately broad birthing gags we're suddenly broadsided by a neartragic turn of events. If you're not skilled enough to walk the fine line between comedy and drama in a single scene it's probably best you just stick to one or the other. The problem with What to Expect When You're Expecting is that neither genre is handled particularly well. Any potential bouts of laughter or tears are at the mercy of manufactured scenarios that no couple or parent is likely to find relatable. A good comedy knows how to connect with its audience. A bad one does goofy things with only the hope that someone will laugh. Guess which category this movie falls into? Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

The best line that I have heard to describe this comes from a fellow IMDb user gregeichelberger It's New Year's Eve in the neonatal unit Valentine's Day with a uterus Knocked Up times five. That sums up the whole thing perfectly.The Hollywood ensemble is this frustrating trend to load the movie with as many stars as possible so you have only floating heads and no actual characters. Surprisingly one of the worst offenders is the similarlythemed indie dramedy Conception 2010 where we get to follow 9 yes 9! different couples. This movie isn't as bad there are only 5 main couples.The intertwining of them is very limited. The four other girls basically all watch Jules Cameron Diaz on her reality TV shows. The timing on the other hand is all in sync. They get pregnant at the same time start showing at the same time and give birth at the same time. The point is of course that you don't know what to expect since each girl's pregnancy is different and experiences it differently.Jules is going to control it  whether her partner tags along or not Holly Jennifer Lopez is going to lie her way through adoption if that's what it takes Wendy Elizabeth Banks wants the joy but gets the worst Skyler Brooklyn Decker is going to make it perfect just like herself Rosie Anna Kendrick doesn't know what she's going to do. If the movie had left it at that it would have been cute romantic funny and heartfelt and possibly empowering.But then they introduced the dude pack which is even worse than it sounds. They are a group of fathers led by Chris Rock who are given the stupidest sounding lines to try and make funny. It was painful how unfunny it was. Imagine if you will a Hollywood writer being paid to come up with neverbeforesaid lines to turn into popular catchphrases. The way Horrible Bosses was almost successful but ultimately not with Sudeikis' I would like to bend her over a barrel and show her the fifty states. That was exactly the case with the comedy in this movie. All of their lines were met with a few unimpressed question marks on faces but never any laughs.However the motherstobe were pretty good. Some were on the boring side but two were able to deliver enough humour and heart to almost make up for the entirety of What to Expect When You're Expecting. I don't know what it is about Anna Kendrick but she makes my heart melt every time she's on the screen. Extremely cute in a relatable kind of way and able to hold our hearts she was the one that got us through this movie. Elizabeth Banks was able to go as overthetop as only pregnant movie heroines are allowed to and gave it her all to deliver the comedy of what not to expect. Of course it wasn't quite enough because we do know exactly what to expect.".

	schema:reviewBody "You know what I expect? I expect better movies! What to Expect When You're Expecting is once again another ensemble romcom that's basically just a bunch of short stories glued together in a fulllength motion picture. You know with a cast like this this movie would have been better off with a title like What to Expect When You're 'Selling Out'. I wouldn't say that this movie was godawful I suppose that maybe a married couple might enjoy something here but this is still an unoriginal predictable and unmemorable piece of nothing. Director Kirk Jones has provided to give us a giant predictable sellout that does nothing but go with the usual clichs. In movies like this we usually get a bunch of individual stories packed in one movie some that we care about and some that we don't care about. Each story talks about a group of couples who are about to either have a baby adopt a baby or deciding whether to have the baby or not. We've seen these stories plenty of times before so there's already a clue for the audience to know what will happen next. There are some chuckleinducing moments and I cared for a few story lines but it's just a shame because there are so many likable actors in this movie so this might be considered as a waste of talent. Cameron Diaz plays a weight loss contestant on a reality show who's expecting a newborn with Matthew Morrison Jennifer Lopez takes the Angelina Jolie perspective to adopt an African baby Elizabeth Banks plays a pregnant woman with tons of anxiety problems on the torture of pregnancy and what do you know Chris Rock is actually the leader of a group of baby daddies. These story lines are probably careless and mostly not funny if you ask me! The only two story lines I actually enjoyed involves Anna Kendrick as a young woman who is expecting a baby after a certain onenight stand and Dennis Quaid as a NASCAR legend who's expecting a new baby with his much younger and ridiculously hot wife played by Brooklyn Decker. I actually need to score this movie some points for that! But either way I wasn't surprised! This movie is exactly what everyone thought it was going to be so I guess I can say I'm not really that upset with this movie. But What to Expect When You're Expecting is not worth watching in any way but if you're the type of person who enjoys these type of movies my advice to you...wait for rental! I didn't expect that remark to pop out of my mouth. What to Expect When You're Expecting in my review predictable and mediocre but overall unimpressive.".

Cameron Diaz plays a weight loss contestant on a reality show who's expecting a newborn with Matthew Morrison Jennifer Lopez takes the Angelina Jolie perspective to adopt an African baby Elizabeth Banks plays a pregnant woman with tons of anxiety problems on the torture of pregnancy and what do you know Chris Rock is actually the leader of a group of baby daddies. These story lines are probably careless and mostly not funny if you ask me! The only two story lines I actually enjoyed involves Anna Kendrick as a young woman who is expecting a baby after a certain onenight stand and Dennis Quaid as a NASCAR legend who's expecting a new baby with his much younger and ridiculously hot wife played by Brooklyn Decker. I actually need to score this movie some points for that! But either way I wasn't surprised! This movie is exactly what everyone thought it was going to be so I guess I can say I'm not really that upset with this movie. But What to Expect When You're Expecting is not worth watching in any way but if you're the type of person who enjoys these type of movies my advice to you...wait for rental! I didn't expect that remark to pop out of my mouth. What to Expect When You're Expecting in my review predictable and mediocre but overall unimpressive.";

Cameron Diaz might be as unfunny as she can get same goes for Elizabeth Banks.Only woman who almost saves this mess entirely is Anna Kendrick. But even her character goes from hitolow in a split second making you shake your head so hard in disbelief that it might actually fall off. And her characters resolution ... don't get me started on that.So while the movie tries very hard to be sweet and partly achieves it it is more annoying than anything else.

It's way more dramatic but does give a rather quirky look at pregnancy and that 9month process. I didn't have huge expectations going into it but it kept me engaged and that was a surprise. It did have some touching moments and I did really get into the characters and their different dramas. I liked the way they showed the connection between these women especially since SPOILERS they're not all friends and don't even know each other save for one exception. Yeah you'd think they were all buddies given the poster but they're not. The interactions are mostly between the individual women and their individual scenarios with their boyfriendshusbands which are ironically happening coincidentally. That was a real interesting way to portray this drama. I enjoyed it. It's obviously not for everyone but that doesn't really make it bad. 8 out of 10!".

Nevertheless the niche isn't very important because the result is the same a pathetic movie with many famous actors but a deplorable screenplay. So this tedious adaptation fails on every single level as a comedy it's completely unfunny and it doesn't respect the spirit of the book on which it was based because it doesn't offer any advice or inspiration to the future mothers with one exception pretty people also suffer.In previous occasions when Hollywood took books to the big screen they were novels comics or biographies...something with a story characters chronological flow or similar elements of narrative art. However money calls money so any successful book is currently susceptible to be adapted into a movie. The book What to Expect When You're Expecting has sold millions of copies and it's been very useful for many families to face the difficulties of pregnancy at least that's what I have been told. On the other hand the film What to Expect When You're Expecting is a rehash of melodramatic clichs and romantic comedy formulas structured in a series of situation with a bad shape and null rhythm. The result is a film full of insipid dialogues and synthetic sentimentality which only provokes yawns.I honestly can't find any positive element in What to Expect When You're Expecting but at the same time I admit the fact that I have a biological disadvantage and I can't evaluate the film from the point of view of someone who has lived or is living pregnancy. Who knows? The screenplay I found intolerable might hide valuable observations and amusing references to moms and future moms who might feel themselves identified with the characters of this film after all Cameron Diaz Jennifer Lopez and Brooklyn Decker are faithful reflections of the average woman right?. But from my personal experience I can't recommend by any means this execrable piece of junk. And the worst thing of all is that What to Expect When You're Expecting establishes an unfortunate precedent to the adaptations of more books lacking of story. I can already imagine some Hollywood screenwriter trying to write Handbook of iPhone The Movie...Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher are two linguistic geniuses who meet each other playing Words with Friends they hate each other on the beginning but their rivalry becomes into a romance Julia Roberts and Bradley Cooper accidentally exchange telephones at a caf and they attempt to meet each other following the dates of their respective calendars when they finally meet they feel they know each other so well that they decide to get married Patrick Dempsey is a lawyer who sends an innocent text message to the judge Halle Berry but the auto correct acts up and makes it a sexually suggestive message the judge makes him arrest and the lawyer must defend his innocence at court...even though that will mean revealing his love for Berry and finally Robin Williams starts a trial for the State to recognize his marriage to Zooey Deschanel. The problem? Williams ends up falling in love with his lawyer Jennifer Garner and Deschanel becomes so jealous that she will make Garner's life impossible.".

This is one of those ALLStar multiple plot line movies in which the thread that binds all these stories together is so thin it may as well not exist. We have the Hollywood couple of Cameron Diaz Jules the health guru and Matthew Morrison Evan professional dancer who meet on Evan's TV dance show and formed a relationship. Jules helped Gary Ben Falcone lose 100 pounds on her weightloss show. Gary is married to Wendy Elizabeth Banks who finally gets pregnant after two years of trying. Gary's father is Ramsey Dennis Quaid an exprofessional car racer married to his young wife Skyler Brooklyn Decker also pregnant and probably the best thing this film has going for it. Skyler's cousin is Rosie Anna Kendrick who has a one night stand with Marco Chace Crawford. And to round out this celebrity cast is professional baby photographer Holly Jennifer Lopez and her boytoy Alex Rodrigo Santoro who cannot have a baby are in the process of adopting.The film is called What to expect when you're expecting however the better name would be What are the worst possible things to happen when you are expecting. I mean EVERY POSSIBLE BAD thing that could possibly go wrong during your pregnancy is definitely explored in this film!!! The film is such a downer in the first 71 minutes of this film I felt that I needed to start taking antidepressants just to make it to the end of this film. Though the film does start to lighten up in the final 39 minutes by the time that occurs the damaged is done and it's WAY TOO LITTLE TOO LATE to save this comedy or rather dramamedy or just call it what it really is a tragedy !!! I did not enjoy this film not in the least!!! I was looking for an evening of light comedic entertainment and was beatdown with bad relationship issues a miscarriage hemorrhoids breast feeding and the pro and cons of circumcisions and I was NOT HAPPY!!!! Maybe there is an audience out there for this film however if you are a male 1880 this film is not for you!!!! Do not be fooled by the images of Chris Rock and others loaded down with every baby buggy bundle bobble on the market and say Hey that looks like it could be funny. Because IT'S NOT!!!!!

	schema:headline " A waste of a good cast";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm usually pretty good at weeding out the films that put all the best scenes in the trailer then leave you with a bunch of junk when you actually sit through it in its entirety. But I must admit I was fooled with this one. The daddy's group shown in the previews led me to believe this would be an edgy hilarious take on pregnancy. Considering Chris Rock was featured heavily in the clips I thought it would be a safe bet. Unfortunately Chris Rock's  Dudes group has minimal screen time and even when they are on screen the material is just not funny. If you've seen the trailer you've seen the best this movie has to offer.I guess the producers thought they had a huge summer blockbuster on their hands I mean why else would they pay top dollar for so many Alist actors all in one film if they didn't believe the film would be successful enough to see a return on their investments? It really does baffle me because this film is nowhere near as good as it should be to warrant the hefty paychecks of this cast.The film centers around a montage of female characters from early pregnancy to delivery with the exception of Jennifer Lopez she's looking to adopt. There's a young 20something who hardly knows her beau at all a woman who's been looking forward to conceiving with relish but finds the reality of it a rather unpleasant surprise her younger motherinlaw who annoyingly seems to handle her pregnancy with hardly a glitch and a fitness guru who thinks she can control the whole ordeal like she does her diet and exercise regimen.Ironically as a stand alone any one of these couples stories could have been developed into a decent film. However the mingling of all these stories results in a shallow treatment that makes the film underwhelming. And while this wouldn't necessarily make or break it add in the fact that the film is just not funny enough and it's just a waste. Some genuine humor would have made the flaws forgivable. Consider this The only funny scene of the film is about 20 seconds in duration containing nonmain characters who have about 10 minutes total screen time. Wendi McLendonCovery of Bridesmaids and Thomas Lennon share the single funny scene in the film and they're hardly in the movie which means.......you get the point.Overall there is some potential with this film it's just underdeveloped and badly written. I wouldn't pay to see it but it's good way to while away a couple hours if you happen to catch it on TV. Other than that steer clear. This coming from a chick who enjoys rom coms. Thumbs down.".

	schema:headline " Not so great expectations";
	schema:reviewBody "I expected at least a bit more creativity in the romcom What to Expect When You're Expecting. Sure I knew it is a prototype chick flick and yes I am aware I am a male humanoid. But please did you expect me to enjoy the ridiculous and humdrum scenes of this movie. Let me start with the embryonic part of this review. What to Expect When You're Expecting focuses on several stories of women and their pregnancies and adoptions. One story is of a realityshow host celebrity Jules who unexpectedly gets pregnant by another realityshow host celebrity Evan their biggest quarrel is if the child should be circumcised I don't know about you but that just does not cut it for me in sheer entertainment. Another one is the neurotic Wendy who has desperately tried to get pregnant with her formerlyobese hubby Gary and low and behold the unexpected happens one day and Wendy is in pregoland. Yet another yawning story is of Holly a photographer who is not able to get pregnant so decides to get all AngelinaJolied by adopting an African orphan. And then there is Gary's father Ramsey who impregnates his young stunning wife Skyler who goes through the pregnancy experience as if nothing which is pretty close to what this movie was. And I am not even touching the part of a quartet of sugar park daddies who are part of a creepy paternal cult that walk their babies on strollers in the park but what do you expect from Director Kirk Jones' dismal film. The only story that I found semiappealing was of young Rosie and Marco Rosie unexpectedly gets pregnant from a onenight stand experience from the Don de Marco and it authentically incorporates within their relationship. But this movie in the end beginning and middle did not even have one ounce of creativity no thanks to Shauna Cross and Heather Hach's mechanical screenplay. The cast of this movie decided not to labor it too much with tons of silly performances from the likes of Cameron Diaz Jennifer Lopez Chris Rock Elizabeth Banks and Dennis Quaid many of these established actors have been known to deliver worthy performances but not in this delivery. I did think that the up andcoming Anna Kendrick was genuine with her performance as Rosie. And Rebel Wilson was a rebel with a cause with her comedic performance as Wendy's assistant Janice. Nevertheless I rather go through a cesarean section then revisit the awful sections of What to Expect When You're Expecting. It is my birth right to proclaim this movie as one of the worst movies of 2012.  Needs Improvement".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the misnomer of a title Warner Bros.Colorado Territory remains a well liked and memorable forties western. Produced for Warners in 1949 by Anthony Villiers and tightly directed by Raoul Walsh this was the vintage director's reworking of his own classic 1941 Bogart gangster hit High Sierra as a western. The result turned out to be an exciting and top notch outdoor western adventure. However its somewhat hoary and clichd title does tend to give the picture a cheap and dismissive B picture status which is totally unwarranted. They could just as easily have called it simply Colorado which not only would have been a title of greater dramatic impact but would also have made reference to the character in the story Calorado Carson as played by Virginia Mayo. Written for the screen by John Twist it was based on W.R. Burnett's novel High Sierra and crisply photographed in glorious Black  White by the great Sid Hickok.Outlaw Wes McQueen Joel McCrea is broken out of prison by an old accomplice and mentor Basil Ruysdael to plan and execute one last job  the robbery of 100000 from the southbound Denver  Rio Grande train. But Reno Blake and Duke Harris John ArcherJames Mitchel the two others he has to work with are a couple of mistrustful and devious characters who resent McQueen arriving at the hideout and starting to give orders. Along with the two  for some female company  is an attractive halfbreed dance hall girl Calorado Carson Virginia Mayo who immediately takes a fancy to McQueen because he treats her with some respect. Eventually thwarting a double cross by Reno and Duke during the actual robbery on the speeding train McQueen and Colorado escape with the money on horseback hotly pursued by the US Marshal Morris Ankrum and his posse. The picture ends tragically with a wounded McQueen being boldly defended by Colorado in a fierce gun battle as she tries in vain with two six guns to stop the advancing posse. Together hand in hand Wes and Colorado perish.The acting is generally good from all concerned. In a rare instance of playing an outlaw McCrea gives his usual laconic and appealing performance. But better is Virginia Mayo who is very striking as the hard bitten halfbreed who falls in love with the gentle fugitive. And not forgetting the powerful image she created for the blistering finale. Standing daringly and with trenchant resolve and determination she blasts away with two six guns in defense of her wounded man before being brought down in a hail of gunfire. It is a great cinematic moment!Besides the marvellous monochrome cinematography of Sid Hickock filmed in and around Gallup New Mexico the picture is also buoyed by a terrific score by the ever underrated David Buttolph featuring a sweeping and arching main theme and some great action music especially for the train chase sequence.A good western Colorado Territory was never available on DVD before but now thanks to the Warner Archives label it has just been released in a clean and sharp transfer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Raoul Walsh was perhaps the most entertaining director of the '40's with movies like Objective Burma! They Died with Their Boots On and Gentleman Jim behind his name plus he also made some good early westerns. Sounds like the perfect guy to direct a movie like this especially since this movie is a western remake of his earlier directed movie classic High Sierra with Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino. This movie might not be as 'starfilled' as the original but it's just as entertaining arousing and intriguing on its own.Westerns from the '40's were much different from the later spaghettiwesterns everybody knows. The early westerns from the '40's and the decades before that are a bit forgotten movies probably mainly because they differ so much from the later westerns from the '60's and '70's that everybody from that and later generations basically grew up with. Westerns from the '40's were much darker and possibly less formulaic. This movie is basically more 'filmnoir' than real western. It has all the basic filmnoir ingredients in it Backstabbing characters treacherous woman a criminal plot and mysterious unpredictable characters. It makes this movie also real perfect to watch for persons who don't like spaghettiwesterns.Leave it up to director Raoul Walsh to tell a story well and entertaining. The story of Colorado Territory really isn't the most spectacular story you could think of but the way it is told and brought to the screen all can be called spectacular. The movie is filled with some real good action sequences and spectacular looking stunts. But granted that the storytelling is not completely flawless. The movie is perhaps a bit too short and the love story of the movie also doesn't quite work out as good as it could had been. I don't know for some reason it just doesn't feel right or connects with the rest of the movie.The storytelling also makes sure that the movie remains for most part unpredictable which also helps to make the filmnoir elements work out. Colorado Territory is a rare both unpredictable and entertaining movie.The cast is solid. It isn't filled with the most known actors of its period. Perhaps Errol Flynn was expected to play a role in this since he worked a lot with Raoul Walsh in the '40's but instead the main part is played by Joel McCrea who was an expert at playing characters in westerns. He plays a good and convincing toughguy who has a good heart. Perhaps a bit too much of a good heart to make the story entirely believable but that's just common and entirely fitting for '40's moviemaking standards.An interesting to watch and spectacular entertaining noirwestern that just like its original version High Sierra deserves to be seen.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Joel McCrea stars as the outlaw Wes McQueen who makes one last train robbery in Raoul Walsh's exceptional and sprawling Western remake of his own High Sierra.

The presence of Virginia Mayo in this group doesn't make a lot of sense but her part increases as the film moves along. One of the film's best plot lines is the jealousy that comes to the surface of Reno's character as Mayo's Colorado Carson is clearly taken with the cool McQueen played by McCrae. On the other side of the law is a ruthless and relentless US Marshall played by Morris Ankrum who leads an impressively sized posse out to catch up with and either shoot or hang McQueen. The film zeroes in on treachery and deceit at every opportunity. Dorothy Malone's character is especially memorable.".

I finally saw it and greatly enjoyed it from beginning to end. It does have some points in common in the story but it is a totally different film. I would place it among the best westerns ever made. Joel McCrea is ideal for the character he plays a man who escapes from jail and wants to become honest but everything goes against him. He meets Henry Hull and his daughter Dorothy Malone on a stagecoach and starts idealizing her as the perfect wife but he really does not know her. When he meets Virginia Mayo who is together with the outlaws he does not care so much for her initially. Virginia is outstanding in this movie totally different from the tomboy she played in Along the Great Divide also directed by Raoul Walsh and where she was also great. There is a very good sequence of a train robbery also a beautiful cinematography in black and white. This film has been called pessimistic probably because at the time it was made most westerns were meant to provide light entertainment but seeing it nowadays I would not qualify it as that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Colorado Territory is directed by Raoul Walsh and adapted to screenplay by Edmund H. North and John Twist from the novel High Sierra written by W.R. Burnett. It stars Joel McCrea Virginia Mayo Dorothy Malone and Henry Hull. Music is by David Buttolph and cinematography by Sidney Hickox.Raoul Walsh remakes his own High Sierra from 1941 but supplants it into a western setting  with tremendous results. McCrea plays outlaw Wes McQueen who springs from prison and vows to go straight but with a price on his head he is coerced into one last railroad robbery. If he can escape the law he can make a go of it as a new man with a new man and comforted by a new found love of a good woman Colorado Carson Mayo. Can he escape the law and those who would sell him for money?A remake of a classic film noir Colorado Territory is itself classic film noir. Whilst not reaching the dizzying star heights of Bogart's 41 version this is a film of great strengths.

	onyx:emotionText "Colorado Territory is directed by Raoul Walsh and adapted to screenplay by Edmund H. North and John Twist from the novel High Sierra written by W.R. Burnett. It stars Joel McCrea Virginia Mayo Dorothy Malone and Henry Hull. Music is by David Buttolph and cinematography by Sidney Hickox.Raoul Walsh remakes his own High Sierra from 1941 but supplants it into a western setting  with tremendous results. McCrea plays outlaw Wes McQueen who springs from prison and vows to go straight but with a price on his head he is coerced into one last railroad robbery. If he can escape the law he can make a go of it as a new man with a new man and comforted by a new found love of a good woman Colorado Carson Mayo. Can he escape the law and those who would sell him for money?A remake of a classic film noir Colorado Territory is itself classic film noir. Whilst not reaching the dizzying star heights of Bogart's 41 version this is a film of great strengths. Thematically it's noir gold dust the great Walsh not pandering to anyone and ensuring the dark edges of Burnett's novel play out on screen including the shattering finale. The photography is grade A both in chiaroscuro textures and sumptuous location framings.

In some films such as The Tall Men and The Bend in the River the man is able to escape the reach of the law and presumably accomplish his transformation. In others such as this he is doomed to die trying.Fugitive badman Wes McQueenJoel McCrea and feisty tomboyish femme fatal ColoradoVirginia Mayo have high hopes of 'busting out' of his past baggage and making a new start together as ranchers in Mexico hopefully out of reach of pursuing US lawmen. But McQueen is contracted to lead one last train heist as a condition of help in his Missouri jail break and to provide start up money for their future. This puts him on the radar as the 1 western badman leading to the quick demise of both. Yep it's presented as a tragic too late love story. McQueen seems like too nice a guy in most ways to fit his outlaw side. Clearly Colorado is fatally infatuated by his combination of dangerousness and decency. Yep he's her man and she will follow him to the grave.Although officially a remake of High Sierra in a western setting McQueen seems loosely modeled on Jesse James who reputedly was planning to give up his outlaw ways after one more robbery when he was assassinated by a gang member. It also repeats some key features of the previous Duel in the Sun. It lacks any substantial musical or humorous elements being a harddriving drama and love story. The photography is excellent much of it in darkened settings in crisp BW. In addition to the canyonland settings the train robbery sequence was done with the DurangoSilverton railway in the SW Colorado mountains. It supposedly takes place when Colorado was a territory from 186176.This is yet another western where the leading mandare I claim hero? gets involved with 2 new beautiful single women one conventionally prim often newly arrived from the East and the other a 'bad' flamboyant extraordinary beauty. Probably in most films the leading manwho often has a tainted past himself eventually ends up with the 'good' girl. In Anthony Man's The Far Country clearly the 'bad' woman is made for Jeff but she dies defending him in a gun battle. Hence he is left with the 'good' girl whom he considers too young and naive. In the present film the choice is made more complicated by the reversal of the characterization of the two women during the film. Thus when JulieDorothy Malone learns that the tall handsome man who earlier saved her from a stagecoach bandit holdup is actually a notorious escaped convict with a 20000. reward for his capture she tries to open the door and tell the posse that McQueen is inside so she can collect the reward.Jesse James's capture topped out at only 10000. during the same era!. A cat fight ensues as Colorado tries to keep her from informing the posse. Previous to this Colorado expertly extracted a bullet lodged in McQueen's shoulder with doctor's tweezer's as if she had performed many such operations? cauterizing the wound by lighting a bit of gunpowder!. Yes this is a historically legitimate procedure but has to be done expertly for a good result! Obviously from this point on Colorado is the woman McQueen can trust to back him up. Like Tracy in Harry Tracy Desperado McQueen tells his girl that he now has to go it alone knowing that he will resist recapture to the death. Once McQueen is trapped by the posse in what clearly looks like the spectacular Canyon de ChellyAZwhich they ominously dub 'The Canyon of Death' it's pretty obvious he's not coming out alive especially since he can hold his rifle with only one arm. Unlike Tracy's girl Colorado feels she must die taking a measure of revenge on the posse.Before they split McQueen gives Colorado essentially all the stolen money. She stuffs some in the offering box in the old Spanish mission and hides the rest nearby before praying at the alter. Presumably this is what the friar meant in the closing scene when he said this backwater village was renewed by this happy couple who passed through. The posse has no idea where to look for the money and the friars probably won't find the major part for some time.Although his past says he's a habitual desperado McQueen comes across as one of the few characters we can trust along with Julie's fatherplayed by perennial scene stealer Henry Hull and Colorado. Julie McQueen's other partners in the holdup Reno and Duke as well as associates Pluthner and Wallace clearly are untrustworthy backstabbers. Viginia Mayo is winsome as the knockout fancyfree badman's moll with catlike gleaming eyes. She would revisit her passionate tomboy persona in the later excellent Raoul Walsh western Along the Great Divide where she has another meaty role in trying to save her father from a lynching or courtordered hanging as an alleged murderer as well as rustler.".

I'll admit I had some innocent fun in comparing the similarities of both.

His only chance to fit into a criminal role would be when it's 'forced' on him and I don't recall that being the case in this one. But why quibble? Here we have the superior art direction and fast action mostly in the second half true typical of WB at it's late 40'searly 50's peak. This sort of thing makes up for a lot of any kind of castingscripting deficiencies in my book. And what an underrated actress is Virginia Mayo! She can be fiery one moment and then quiet and subtle the next. Very desirable in this one. I mostly prefer my westerns in good color but think perhaps this one was pessimistic and dark enough to warrant BW without decreasing the entertainment value as in Walsh's PURSUED.".

Ida Lupino's vulnerable Marie provides a strong match for his powerhouse performance.Walsh remade High Sierra in 1949 as a western photographed like his previous outing in the genre Pursued in a distinct noir mood and style. If anything Colorado Territory tops High Sierra in cumulative impact McCrea and Mayo bring an intense dark romanticism wholly befitting their rush to doom and Walsh's treatment of the landscapes that both dwarf them and swallow them up is outstanding. This has my vote as one of the genre's top 20.".

	schema:reviewBody "Doug Benson a standup comic you may know from VH1 got the idea to make a documentary about himself smoking weed for 30 days. Ya know just like Morgan Spurlock from Supersize Me where he ate McDonald's for 30 straight days. This has got to be one of the coolest ideas for a documentary in the history of documentaries. It was a pretty interesting flick but unfortunately from a person who makes people laugh for a living not very funny.The flick starts off with Doug not smoking for 30 days and then once that 30 day sequence ends he begins to smoke constantly for the next 30 days. With each sequence he's subject to a bunch of tests from taking the SATs to a psychic test. Also he doesn't quit his day job while he's making the film. You get to see him perform his acts when he has them booked high or not.Doug Benson is a pretty good comic. He has his own slightly flamboyant immature style that he's got down pretty well. He made me smile a few times and possibly giggle once or twice but none of it was really that funny. He talks about pot about how it's cool and he misses it and that's about it. But if you're a fan of Doug's or stand up comedy you should definitely find this flick funny. The two funniest scenes for me was when he wasn't on stage telling jokes but when one of the producers was making a mess of Doug's apartment because of his butter fingers. And a fart gag with some tuba's was nice.Doug even before he began this little experiment was a pothead. There's no doubt about it. And this is what makes the whole process not so intriguing. If you know a seasoned burnout you know they tend to just get stoned. They can easily be high in almost any situation. If Doug wasn't such a pothead it would have been much more entertaining. Morgan Spurlock was a very healthy person so eating McDonald's nonstop would have drastic affects. But since Doug is a pothead in reallife this little 30 day bender isn't really anything too amazing to watch. He's such a veteran smoker that he doesn't exhibit any humorous sideeffects. You don't see him paranoid see him geekout in a laughing fit seeing him cough his brains out etc. etc. Pretty much all the things that's made any Cheech and Chong flick incredibly funny. But I do thank him for being a pothead if he wasn't this movie probably would never have been made.Super High Me was a cool documentary that gave some neat information concerning California laws the history on Marijuana Dispensaries in California and how many types of ways you can actually get high by THC. Lip balm. Believe it.I firmly believe that if Doug wasn't a seasoned smoker this film would have been much more funny. If you've seen one glassyeyed pothead you've seen them all and unfortunately his smoking didn't help make his standup act any funnier either. Then again maybe I'm to blame. Maybe I need to lighten up and just light one up.".

If you've seen one glassyeyed pothead you've seen them all and unfortunately his smoking didn't help make his standup act any funnier either. Then again maybe I'm to blame. Maybe I need to lighten up and just light one up.";

It stars comedian Doug Benson who I knew from The MarijuanaLogues.As Benson describes in the beginning of the film the basic premise is like the one in Super Size Me but with pot instead of McDonald's.He goes through 30 days of detox only to spend another 30 days smoking marijuana nonstop. He has 'tests' done interviews a bunch of other comedians and his standup routines all intertwined with the 'experiment'. This makes for a nice lighthearted fun movie. There's offensive language but it's what you'd expect from standup comedians.Stoners will certainly find something to enjoy here. And although this movie is a comedy and Doug claims he just wants to get stoned there are a few key moments in the film that show people who actually need medical marijuana and the ridiculous state of affairs in which the DEA violates state laws and makes things difficult for folks that are in pain  these moments are intense and sad. One can only hope this will change in the near future.Had this movie turned into a more political direction it would be deserving of a much higher mark in my opinion. As it stands it's a nice and funny movie about pot and I'm glad I had the chance to watch this today and celebrate.Peace out 810".

Benson must have decided not to settle for anything less than the top spot because although the magazine hasn't since repeated their ranking the frequentlystoned funnyman has gone out and made an entire movie about his lifelong love affair with marijuana.Super High Me started out as a jokepart of Benson's stand up routine. Riffing off Morgan Spurlock's documentary Super Size Me in which that filmmaker documented the effects of eating nothing but McDonalds fast food for thirty days in a row Benson wondered what would happen to his health if he smoked pot nonstop for thirty days straight. As he joked with the packed SXSW crowd following the film's screening the experiment wouldn't be too far removed from what he was doing already.Let the experiment begin. Just to make sure that everything was as scientifically pure as could be expected in such a dubious experiment Benson goes clean and sober for a month. He has doctors check his general health and memory while he does the temporary rehab. Then it's thirty days of nonstop tokage Benson has a prescription so he's not really breaking any laws here. Bemused doctors monitor Benson's health throughout his ordeal. He ends up gaining weight and his lung capacity goes down but his intelligence scores and sperm count go way up. I think that it's safe to say that neither Benson nor the audience learn anything notable about marijuana use from Super High Me.But that's not the point. Super High Me works simply because Benson is a very funny dude stoned or not. The film works as an amusing experiment made all the more enjoyable by Benson's funny observations and an occasional bon mot by his semifamous comedian friends. The promarijuana crowd at SXSW was thrilled by the film's wit. Naturally more conservative audiences won't be quite as amused.Super High Me does eschew humor at the end and somewhat awkwardly looks into the conflict between California and Federal laws regarding marijuana. The issue is too serious to merge with the rest of the film's humor but not given enough weight within the film to serve as an effective rallying cry for the audience. Who knows? Perhaps Benson needs to make a sequel to give the issue its full due. As it stands the film can't seem to decide if it wants to be an allout comedy or a critique of US drug policy. It tries to do both and only partially succeed.The bottom line is that Super High Me is still a lot of fun particularly if you see it with the right crowd. Benson knows that finding the right audience is half the battle and since he admits that many of his fans will be too stoned to go to the theater he is offering to ship a DVD copy of the film to anybody who will set up a screening in their city.

Cannabis is a subject that could be talked about for hours with much depth and with some entertainment but this Documentary really seems like a guy who has found a niche market and is trying to exploit it to increase his demographic by filling it with his standup. His stand up is a completely different conversation that I'm not even going to get into. Let's just say I chuckled barely a few times at best.

This film is a joke turned documentary a parody of Super Size Me but with cannabis instead of MC Donald's. What i expected was to watch this guy smoke tons of weed and cover subjects related to it both of which are seldomely met. The truth is Super High Me consists mostly of Doug Benson stand up act. So for the majority we just get jokes about being high with a pointless celebrity appearance here and there with very little concerning the legislation of cannabis. The main point is this watching someone be sober for 30 days then be stoned for 30 days isn't exactly what i'd call entertainment or quality filmmaking.There's only about 34 tests. One for psychic ability is there a point? One for SAT scores One for Sperm Count and one for basic intelligence i guess you'd say. Each of these are covered with about 3040 seconds of screen time twice in the movie so your obviously not getting a lot of information for the majority. This movie pretty much just glamorizes California throughout cause thats the subject most covered. Yes they have dispendencys with different types of pot yes they have DEA take downs and yes they have medical mary jane. I covered that in a probably grammar incorrect sentence. Here its covered for about 1218 minutes very boring. And for a movie called Super High Me i expected to see way more usage. There's a surprising lack of content and as i said before the majority of the movie is his stand up act.The actual production is pretty limited. Basically a guy follows Doug around with a camera not much else no interview shots are planned or anything like a normal documentary the only shot setups i really noticed are those of his stand up act so pretty much its just a guy with a camera filming people talking. No questions are really asked instead we just have stoners talking about gibberish regarding pot Although that pot prince guy was pretty hilarious. The sound balance is uneven at times music will play and render a speaker inaudible. The interviewees don't exactly have any significance at one point one there is Brian Posehn who just eats his burger doesn't say crap and the scene ends and also one with his costar Sarah Silverman just taking some type of rip from some type of vaporizer the guitarists of janes addiction is there playing some chords not saying a thing the scene ends. This is pretty much proof that someone in the crew has to be sober for a movie to be good.So pretty much all you have here is stand up which at times is actually pretty funny. The actual focus of the documentary isn't exactly 'focused'. Stoners just aren't that interesting they smoke pot and sit back and be lazy thats about it. I'm a pothead who smokes pretty damn often and i wasn't exactly impressed. Smoke a blunt and watch something a little bit more worthwhile like half baked or harold and kumar this isn't really a entertaining or groundbreaking documentary. If your really interested in the effects and culture of cannabis check out bbc's show Should I Smoke Dope its pretty much what this should have been.".

What seemed to be ironically ignored especially by Doug Benson was that he spent the entire movie in a droopy eyed slightly slurred state of very mild stupor that may feel great to him but is very uncomfortable to those around him.It was interesting that known marijuana problems such as paranoia were barely touched upon and even examinations of respiratory risks were restricted to measurement of lung capacity with no discussion of whether marijuana presents a greater or lesser risk than tobacco to lung cancer.The sad thing is this documentary could have been a great opportunity to educate about any benefits or hazards connected to marijuana usage but instead it was just a pathetic excuse for a selfavowed stoner to go on the ultimate bender.Selfindulgent rubbish.".

	schema:headline " A Confused Muddled Political Film on Mariuana";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film in its Regional Premiere at the SXSW Film Festival. The point of the film seems to be to openly steal Morgan Spurlock's 30Day premise from Super Size Me and apply to stoner comedian Doug Benson being stoned for 30 days. It lacks the originality of Spurlock's premise. For one many people spend every day stoned and the affects are wellknown. I agree with their premise that that they want to show that marijuana doesn't do much harm to human health and therefore should be legalized. But if this is the best they can do it should perhaps offer some caution about the degree to which marijuana effects cognitive thinking skills and behavior. While it is a funny film at times it adds little to the political debate  unlike the Spurlock film  and doesn't really offer anything new or interesting.As the filmmakers including Benson and director Blieden volunteered during their Q  A after the film they really didn't know what sort of film they wanted to make. Did they want to tell of Benson's humorous 30day stoned journey? Did they want to make a political film about the dispute between state and federal authorities on Marijuana legalization in California? Or did they want to make a club film about Benson's comedy act during the period of his 30day experiment? They couldn't really decide so they combined all three efforts and the film shows that lack of a clear direction. Also they throw in all of these cameos with Benson's comedian buddies that add almost nothing to the film. Incidentally their 10th amendment Constitutional arguments are poorly presented since there is a long tradition of Federal legal supremacy based on Article 4 section 2 of the Constitution which has been the basis of America's Federal system of government for centuries.So it is good for a few laughs and its own political diatribe but it could have been much better. One of the best points that they make is that medical marijuana is in many cases an excuse for recreational drug usage. They imply that it is sort of farce and real debate should be over the legalization of recreational use. If we want to have that debate let's find better film makers and other advocates to make that argument because this barely qualifies as a political documentary. I recommend the film Grass which is a much better film and presents a fascinating history of the prohibition of marijuana in the U.S.".

	schema:headline " Not really a documentary";
	schema:reviewBody "For Starters this should be called The Benson Standup while high comedy routine. Literally 80 of this film is just him performing stand up with poor lighting in various clubs across the U.S. talking about how he is or how great it is to be high. It's one thing to have a serious discussion about the effects of marijuana but its completely pointless to hear some stoner talk about how high he is and how great he feels. All it does is further validate the stereotype that many people who smoke pot just bores everyone else with various uninteresting stories about how high they were in situations which they vaguely remember. Additionally when the entire comedic material is about smoking it gets old. Chapelle or another comedian wouldn't be very funny if their entire routine was based on one subject either.There is more scientific research found in a 7th grade science fair project than this farcical attempt at a scientific experiment about smoking marijuana. One of the stronger parts of the film was the discussion of medicinal marijuana and its effects particularly among seriously ill patients but that was short lived as the documentary quickly cut to yet ANOTHER dimly lit stand up routine.Super Size Me was interesting but the downfall in that documentary was that the result of eating fast food everyday for a month was hardly surprising or controversial making the movie a foregone conclusion before it even began. Benson had an opportunity to tackle a serious and controversial subject that is hardly settled sprinkled with moments of hilarity. Benson should have used his comedy routines as a crutch not as a pillar using it now and then to provide some levity to the film. Instead what we got was some stoner who had a little too much financial backing advertising his own stand up routine. The contribution this film gave toward the debate of smoking marijuana is basically unchartable. I would expect high school stoners to put together a more insightful and scientific project than this.However Benson really gave away his lack of commitment to a real project on smoking marijuana as at one point in the film he states something along the lines of I'm not really into the whole activist marijuana thing I just wanna smoke. I only wish that this was shown in a trailer so I could have gotten at least one red flag that this film wasn't going to be very good.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently acquired Italian horror director Michele Soavis Cemetery Man which was released recently for the first time on DVD. I had seen it before but somehow now it became one of my favorite horror films. It has a style beauty and grace that many horror films seem to miss nowadays. So naturally I set my eyes on seeing all of Michele Soavis horror films. I had already seen two of them The Church and Cemetery Man and The Sect isn't out on DVD so I decided to see his only other movie on DVD which is Stagefright. This was Michele Soavis directorial debut so I didn't really know what to expect. A flawed film made by an at the time rookie? A promising film with glimpses of greatness here and there? The story is about this group of actors that are putting up a play. They have very little time to practice some of the dance moves and songs so they are all under a lot of pressure. A psycho killer finds his way to the theater and locks everybody inside with absolutely no way out. Then he begins to systematically kill all the actors on the play in some really gruesome ways.Well its no secret that Soavi was Argentos pupil and I think that out of all of Soavis horror films that I have seen Stagefright is the one in which this is most evident. There's the killers point of view some strange and interesting camera angles and even an animal themed killer. But thats not a bad thing in my book because eventually Soavi found his own voice and style as evidenced by his last horror film Cemetery Man. Still Stagefright has a great style and look. What I love the most about Soavis films is that they deal with all these horrible killings yet the film has a class and a finesse about it that kind of elevates the sleaziness of the slasher genre to a high that it rarely reaches.Don't get me wrong here this movie may be artsy and classy but its still very very much a slasher film. There's some truly brutal deaths here! After the movie sets up its premise the ball gets rolling really fast! Thats one of the things I liked the most about this movie it had a fast pace and wasn't boring in the least! Once the killer puts on that cool as hell Owls Head mask on his noggin things get really gory and interesting. From people being cut in half with chainsaws great scene man! to some cool decapitations this movie had me cheering for more! So slasher fans and fiends you wont be disappointed! Another excellent thing about this movie was that it wasn't an incoherent mess. I've seen a lot of Lucio Fulci films a lot of Dario Argento films and a few other Italian directors and they all suffer from the same illness. They cant seem to bring together a story and tell it in a coherent understandable fashion. Not so with Soavis Stagefright. I was surprised at how smoothly the story flowed and I was surprised that I was actually understanding it without any extreme effort. In a sense I would say that Soavi took everything that Argento and Fulci did wrong and did it right. He learned from their mistakes and therefore he is a better filmmaker for it. He is the next step in the evolutionary ladder as far as Italian Horror goes. This might also be why Soavi is heralded as the savior of Italian Horror by many a horror connoisseurs.So in conclusion Stagefright is a solidly well directed slasher. One that showed promise for what is one of horrordoms best directorseven though his body of work is comprised of only four movies. I hope Soavi wakes up from that dream soon and delivers us with something as good or better then what he has already done. Soavi you the man! Rating 5 out of 5".

	onyx:emotionText "I recently acquired Italian horror director Michele Soavis Cemetery Man which was released recently for the first time on DVD. I had seen it before but somehow now it became one of my favorite horror films. It has a style beauty and grace that many horror films seem to miss nowadays. So naturally I set my eyes on seeing all of Michele Soavis horror films. I had already seen two of them The Church and Cemetery Man and The Sect isn't out on DVD so I decided to see his only other movie on DVD which is Stagefright. This was Michele Soavis directorial debut so I didn't really know what to expect. A flawed film made by an at the time rookie? A promising film with glimpses of greatness here and there? The story is about this group of actors that are putting up a play. They have very little time to practice some of the dance moves and songs so they are all under a lot of pressure. A psycho killer finds his way to the theater and locks everybody inside with absolutely no way out. Then he begins to systematically kill all the actors on the play in some really gruesome ways.Well its no secret that Soavi was Argentos pupil and I think that out of all of Soavis horror films that I have seen Stagefright is the one in which this is most evident.

This one however is a cut above no pun intended the majority of other slashers.Stagefright features an abundance of overly gory and creative death scenes. This of course is no bad thing. No bad thing at all. The film's first death scene sees the wardrobe assistant take a pick axe in the face and that death scene alone beats any of the rather dull methods of death featured in other 80's slashers such as Friday the 13th and The Burning single handed and it gets better than that...one actress is stabbed to death in front of her director and the rest of the cast power drills chainsaws axes and fire also feature in the movie's vast weapon repertoire. On the subject of the chainsaw it surely has to be the most underutilised weapon in horror film history. The tool just cries out to be used to maul and saw up victims and yet it hasn't had a great deal of screen time over the years considering it's potential. This movie however has a lovely chainsaw section which sees limbs get lopped bodies carved up and an incredible death scene in which the victim has the lower half of her body removed while being rescued from falling down a trapdoor.This film's main downfall according to some people will be it's characters script and acting. The characters are paper thin the script at times is badly written although not throughout and the acting is wooden to say the least. However as one doesn't go into an 80's slasher movie expecting Oscar winning performances Oscar winning scriptwriting and great characters one can forgive these things. What this movie does have lots of though is style and atmosphere. It's easy to see the influence that master director Dario Argento has had on his understudy Michele Soavi. Soavi who would later go on to direct his masterpiece Dellamorte Dellamore piles on the style in this movie. The style is very reminiscent of the sublime 'Opera' actually which also came out in the great year that was 1987. One scene in particular involving the main character hiding out in the shower while one of her costars is killed in the next booth is very Operaesque indeed. The creepy atmosphere in the movie comes mostly as a result of the claustrophobic setting which is made more claustrophobic when you consider the fact that the characters are locked in with the madman. The creepy atmosphere comes into play again towards the end of the movie when the 'slasher trademark' victim has her final duel with the killer Soavi is able to build up tension through a series of scenes including one very suspenseful sequence in particular which the key to building is wrenched out of the stage floorboards in front of the killer. The suspense in the build up the killer's downfall is not wasted as unlike so many other films Soavi is able to build the movie up to a satisfying and exciting conclusion.Stagefright is an underrated gem and more than deserves the praise that lesser entries in the slasher sub genre such as Friday the 13th receive. A creepy exhibition of atmosphere and creative gore Stagefright comes with the highest recommendation from me.".

The mentally weak man unable to separate reality from his own demented imagination considers himself to be at home and violently begins to annihilate cast and crew.

The stylishly filmed sets and efficient scenery makes it feel like you're watching a more sophisticated version of Bava's Demons. This is exactly what makes him such a brilliant director! Give him little and he still manages to deliver a fully equipped horror film. Call me nuts but I think there are directors who actually have the talent to make violence look like artand Soavi definitely is one of them.

	schema:reviewBody "Michele Soavi's debute film was this wonderful Italian horror film that's simply one of the best slasher films ever made!Cast and crew of a stage production find themselves locked inside their theater with an escaped homicidal maniac!Stylish and colorful direction highlight this excellent giallo film. Soavi makes the most of his clever cinematic techniques with inventive camera work and nice set pieces. Soavi has obviously taken a page from director Dario Argento in his artsy directorial style. He turns the dank catacombs of the theater into a dark shadowy playground for our killer who wears a truly spooky owl's head. Soavi sets up an atmosphere of great tension setting the occurrences during a thunderstorm using great reoccurring imagery and making even the huge theater a claustrophobic trap for our cast. There's some great moments of smart suspense as well like the sequence with Alicia under the stage.Being a giallo film there's a lot of bloody scenery to be had. There's plenty of vicious memorable murder sequences that will please any gorehound to no end! The cast is pretty good even if they are dubbed something fierce. Barbara Cupisti is fetching as the films leading lady. The film boasts a weird and beautiful rock score that has a awesome contrast with the films visuals.All in all Stage Fright aka Deliria is a topnotch film that's a true mustsee for horror fans everywhere! 12 out of ".

	onyx:emotionText "Michele Soavi's debute film was this wonderful Italian horror film that's simply one of the best slasher films ever made!Cast and crew of a stage production find themselves locked inside their theater with an escaped homicidal maniac!Stylish and colorful direction highlight this excellent giallo film. Soavi makes the most of his clever cinematic techniques with inventive camera work and nice set pieces. Soavi has obviously taken a page from director Dario Argento in his artsy directorial style. He turns the dank catacombs of the theater into a dark shadowy playground for our killer who wears a truly spooky owl's head. Soavi sets up an atmosphere of great tension setting the occurrences during a thunderstorm using great reoccurring imagery and making even the huge theater a claustrophobic trap for our cast. There's some great moments of smart suspense as well like the sequence with Alicia under the stage.Being a giallo film there's a lot of bloody scenery to be had. There's plenty of vicious memorable murder sequences that will please any gorehound to no end! The cast is pretty good even if they are dubbed something fierce. Barbara Cupisti is fetching as the films leading lady. The film boasts a weird and beautiful rock score that has a awesome contrast with the films visuals.All in all Stage Fright aka Deliria is a topnotch film that's a true mustsee for horror fans everywhere! 12 out of ";

	schema:headline " Artistic slasher superior to most similar films from the era!";
	schema:reviewBody "A psychotic former actor named Irving Wallace Clain Parker escapes from a mental hospital and hides away in an actress's car. After being driven to a theatre where a group of actors are rehearsing a play he quickly dispatches the actress and then proceeds to lock himself in the theatre for a gruesome night of blood shed. Italian director Michele Soavi directed this artistic and gory slasher movie. Bypassing the usual clichs of 80's slashers StageFright' is a welcome change from the likes of Friday the 13th'. Though the plot does on occasion stretch the lines of credibility there is a persistent feeling of realism created by the way that Soavi is able to manipulate the characters and his exceptionally intelligent use of the soundtrack. Soavi makes the soundtrack an integral part of the movie by having parts of it actually in the world in which his characters reside. This means that the killer is able to manipulate to a point when music is played in order to instil terror in the viewer as well as his victims. Many movies have used a similar effect but few have been able to use it as proficiently and inventively as StageFright'. The soundtrack itself is very fitting to the way the film is paced. Soavi astutely blends a fastpaced and exciting first hour with a more methodical suspensedriven finale. The integration of the pace changes is virtually seamless and really adds to the effect Soavi attempts to create. David Brandon and Barbara Cupisti head up the cast and portray their characters very well. Brandon's portrayal of the merciless but soon remorseful Peter is of a very convincing standard and certainly compliments the constant ominous atmosphere of the movie itself. Although the cast may not be the most talented of performers none of them really failed in putting in a respectable portrayal of their different characters. One highlight was the casting of perennial victim Giovanni Lombardo Radice credited as John Morghen in the role of the rather camp Brett. Radice adds a small but welcome element of humour to the movie with his multiple quips and snide remarks towards other cast members of the play. The humour however rarely takes priority over the main story and once the killing begins the humour is all but gone. The murders themselves are brutal and effective. A wide range of weapons are used to kill off the cast in extremely bloody ways from a knife all the way to the beloved chainsaw. In my opinion it was a shame that the killer wore such a ridiculous looking costume but this did not really have any negative impact on a somewhat harrowing movie. There were some sporadic moments of badly written dialogue and the occasional inconceivable situation but none of that really harms StageFright'. The movie is a very artistic and imaginative slasher that is executed better than the majority of slashers from the same era. The death scenes are generally inventive and particularly bloody. The special effects are also generally of a very high quality and succeed in adding more realism to an already fairly realistic movie. Unfortunately there are few scenes that could be deemed as scary but StageFright' excels at being an atmospheric horror movie. Stylish and artistically directed good performances and for the most part well written. I recommend this movie! My rating for StageFright'  7.510.".

	schema:headline " Great Italian slasher by Michele Soavi";
	schema:reviewBody "Michele Soavi's feature film debut as a director was this film Stage Fright aka Aquarius and Deliria from 1987. The film was produced by veteran producer cinematographer and director Aristide Massaccessi aka Joe D'Amato who is responsible for many hard core porn films action adventures and horror exploitationers from Anthropophagous the Beast to Buio Omega. Stage Fright is written by Luigi Montefiori aka George Eastman the man who played the cannibalistic monster in D'Amato's Anthopophagous and Anthropophagous 2 Absurd so Soavi's debut has many great names in its credits. The actors are also great and include Barbara Cupisti in lead role as Alicia John Morghen Giovanni Lombardo Radice and the director himself in little role as a police officer. D'Amato gave Soavi pretty much freedom to do this film and he did the right thing by trusting this young talent the result is fantastic piece of slasher cinema.A group of stage play actors and crew members are practicing their newest number a horror musical which seems and sounds by the way pretty interesting. It rains hard and one of the actresses hurts her leg so she and her friend have to visit the hospital nearby. Everything goes fine despite the fact that in the same hospital there is a dangerous psychopath killer in mental health therapy and the same guy committed horrible murder some years ago. When he hears some young females are in the hospital old memories start come his mind and willing to kill seems to be born again. When the girls return to the set they soon find themselves trapped inside the huge building and someone killing them one by one. This is the structure of this film and even though it sounds very usual the film is very noteworthy and made by talented people.There are great visuals in this film and it is easy to see Soavi had been working with Argento before his own directorial career. There are twisted camera drives and angles and many little but more than effective details which are also among the elements that make Argento's masterpieces so great. There are many worth mentioning scenes and details in Soavi's film and one is definitely the use of dummies especially at the very end of the film. They are so incredibly ominous at the end scene that it seems like which of the dummies is just dummy and which the killer! Totally stunning imagery and Soavi reminds me of another great horror director Scott Spiegel whose films are also full of little but effective details and crazy camera anglesdrives. Spiegel is perhaps more positively crazy director than Soavi who is pretty calm director but they definitely share this unique style and innovation in their film making.There are many scenes that will scare the viewer especially if the film is viewed in peace and alone in the dark as recommended. The mask the killer wears is very scary and also many memorable scenes include that mask. The tension lasts throughout the film and Soavi really does great job by using visuals and also music in creating atmosphere and tension so rarely found in nowaday horror efforts. The murders themselves are very gruesome but also very stylish and not too gratuitous and that is another thing Soavi has learned without a doubt from Argento. The murders in Stage Fright are gory at times and they may offend some viewers but still I think they only serve the film as a whole since the scenes are horrific without showing too much. I had seen the film previously on murky and bad quality VHS which didn't reveal as near as many little details than the version I saw now. Soavi shows very little at times but it is much more than if he had shown more!The only negative thing in this extraordinary film I found is the ending since I don't know what it's all about. I mean the character who stays repeating line Right between the eyes.. What is the point in this since it is so stupid and gratuitous especially when the characters are mostly pretty believable and personal in this film. I would like to ask Montefiori why he included such stupid ending in his screenplay since it tones a little bit down the whole film and I really was left wondering what's the point in this repeating.The stupid end is easy to forgive since there are so many positive things about this film. I really appreciate Soavi's work on this film and also on his other films like La Setta Sect La Chiesa The Church which are his films I've also seen. Hopefully this talent manages to continue his personal line and do more films despite the fact that as a horrorfantasy director Italy is not as great place to live and work as possible. Stage Fright deserves 910 from me.".

	schema:headline " An impressive debut from Michele Soavi";
	schema:reviewBody "I last saw this film several years ago on YouTube and in less than stellar quality. At that time I was not a great admirer of Soavi perhaps because I was hoping for Dario Argento Jr. and got something different. Since becoming a huge fan of Dellamorte Dellamore 1994 however I've been planning to rewatch his other films and now I'm finally getting around to it. This is Soavi's feature debut  before this he cut his teeth as assistant director to Argento Lamberto Bava and Joe D'Amato  and here we can see the influence of these various mentors. The flamboyant camerawork and imagery certainly bring Argento to mind while the premise an acting troupe gets locked inside a theater with a serial killer is reminiscent of Bava's Demons 1985. The material isn't so similar to D'Amato's work but we have him to thank for the film's existence and for Soavi's directorial career since he was perfectly content to remain an assistant director since he produced it and hired Soavi.As a director Soavi hadn't quite found his own voice yet  he's very imitative of Argento here  but to his credit he conjures imagery worthy of the master. No one who has seen this film will forget the bizarre owl mask donned by the killer an image that would not be out of place in Franju's Judex and the scene of him sitting on stage with the posed bodies of his victims tranquilly stroking a cat as feathers descend on them like snowflakes is one of the most indelible in the whole of Italian horror. What already sets Soavi apart from Argento is his cheeky humor. The comic relief scenes in Argento's films generally come across as rather clumsy and awkward e.g. the befuddled mailman from Four Flies on Grey Velvet but Soavi is consistently clever. The opening scene for instance thwarts our expectations to great comic effect. Still Soavi knows how to stage an effective death scene and he doesn't hold back on the red stuff but even the most horrible scenes tend to have a touch of black humor. One bit I particularly liked involved one of the characters spilling stageblood all over the dressing room as their friend is drilled to death his blood starts to drip onto the fake stuff. I can't help but wonder if this is a tongueincheek criticism of the phonylooking blood in most Italian horror films.The cast is quite strong Barbara Cupisti is a sympathetic heroine David Brandon is brilliant as the temperamental director perhaps Soavi was drawing on his experiences with Argento here and Giovanni Lombardo Radice is pretty amusing as a flamboyantly gay actor. Special praise must be singled out to the actor playing the silent masked killer IMDb claims that it's exploitation legend George Eastman who projects great presence simply through the use of his body language  I'd favorably compare him to Lon Chaney.The experience between my first and second viewings of this little gem is truly night and day. This is not just an astoundingly good film for a first time director but a minor masterpiece of the genre. Dario Argento must have thought so as well Opera bears some striking similarities to it and Argento would subsequently enlist Soavi to direct The Church 1989 and The Sect 1991.".

Scenes involving the killer owl were great just the right amount of carnage that wasn't over the top. How can I forget the girls in the movie they are super attractive as well all wearing skimpy outfits for their stage performance.

	schema:reviewBody "Stage Fright is surprising in how reminiscent it is of Dario Argento's style. Most notably when it gets suspenseful and The Goblinstype music starts playing instead of something more typically suspenseful classical music. Since the plot takes place in a theater filled with actors who happen to be in costume of course it is also bright and colorful and almost artsy just as Argento films tend to be. But moving on.The story's pretty simple. There is a serial killer locked inside a theater with a group of actors. They die off one by one what else did you expect. Simple enough. But what makes this movie so GOOD? The characters are all as they say a character. Animosity exists among the actors but then the killer is out there and so they are a collective group of victims at the same time. They all meet their makers in different way for the killer who creepily enough wears a mask from the play the actors are starring in doesn't have an attachment to any one tool. He will use what he can when he can and you never know what it may be. The lead victim Alicia is easy to empathize with. She's on the quiet side but you don't want her to die and you know if someone gets the killer it will have to be her. The gore is nice as usual some realistic and some not but all of it is somewhat classy.Here's something to think about. The play within the movie goes as so a man goes around raping and killing at night. He wears a mask. Later in the movie for reasons I won't spoil the director wants the killer in the play to be portrayed as the real life killer. Later in the movie and this is all still early on the real life killer puts on the original mask from the play and goes around killing like so. Now how's that for cool? You don't find weird stuff like this in every movie.The general 80's and Broadwayish scenery for Stage Fright is pretty cool too. I was reluctant to watch this because what do I want to see a bunch of actors in some play get slaughtered for? I think Scream ruined that for all of us right? Well I was wrong. This movie is excellent. It all comes together very nicely. It's good to watch in and of itself and it's got a good soundtrack. Plus the story itself which while not the most intricate helps make for an overall excellent movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "We have all seen Stagefright before it's a predictable typical slasher with an unconvincing killer and young pretty people being axed off though this hasn't been done by Michele Soavi. The most noteworthy elements of the film are the camerawork cinematography score and it's violent brutal deaths which are ranked by horror fanatics as some of the most vicious kills in the slasher subgenre. It isn't a movie to be taken seriously and a massive 1980's cheesefest which is what makes it so fantastic.First off what Stagefright fails at is classic slasher rules drugs sex and language which is all absent from this movie. However I don't think the Guide to Making a Slasher Handbook was Soavi's inspiration as this is after all a directional debut. This isn't another Friday the 13th and it isn't another Sleepaway Camp  this is a Michele Soavi movie loaded with outrageous loopy visuals bizarre dialogue bad acting and savage murders. When Soavi came out to the film industry as Argento's protg he really meet expectations and Stagefright along with later films such as The Church and Cemetery Man go to prove it. Yes it does not have naked bodies the characters are not drug inducing menaces and there is a lack of foul language but so what  this is far better than a lot of other slashers that came out in the 80's because it is just so fun and we can thank Soavi's style for that.Whilst the movie is completely silly it's still entertaining especially for the eyes. The visuals are completely wonderful with cinematography exposing colour through the lens in a flamboyant fashion especially when all the characters in the film are wearing such eccentric clothes. The camerawork is professionally solid and stands out the panning is soft the stills are not always very still and it's the style of camerawork one would assume would come from Argento's protg. The score is 1980's cheese but it works a wonder and it fits well in a movie such as Stagefright it's also a hoot to listen to as you watch a woman being torn in half from the waist down.I will not spoil the deaths in this review. There are some really nasty eye opening kills in this movie which are illogical nonsensical and completely derivative but that's Italian Horror for you and as a matter of fact  that's the movies for you. If someone is into violent slashers then this is perhaps the film you've been looking for though the movie isn't overflowing with gore and eye cringing kills which can be a letdown for gore fanatics.Stagefright is typically predictable like one would find in any slasher but it offers something quite unique  it's artistic cinematic elements are fantastic the music is a thrill ride to listen to it's easy to watch the characters are all wearing eccentric 80's fashion like you'd expect from a metropolis stage performer in that era and its environment is at least not a camp beach cemetery small town or anything you've seen one hundred times before in a film which requires the protagonist to take of their clothes. Stagefright is another run of the mill slasher but it is Michele Soavi's run of the mill slasher and that is what makes it unique. It's cheese but it isn't like this movie is taking itself serious so sit back and enjoy this reminder of what Italian slashers were like in the 1980's.".

As this occurs so does the escape of a crazed actormurderer from the local insane asylum whom happened to brutally kill his costar several years back in the same theater. He returns to wreak his vengeance upon the cavernous rehearsal hall's new inhabitants donning an owl mask and weilding a variety of lethal impliments of destruction.As you can see there really isn't much to Stagefright in terms of plot but this aspect does not work against Stagefright it proves to be an asset. Due to the lack of contrived subplots and red herrings director Michele Soavi this film was his debut proving just how strong of a director he is can concentrate on the magnificent atmosphere and carnage that ensues. Speaking of carnage Stagefright not only offers some marvelous suspensetension  but some great gore. The score only helps to accenutate the mood of the movie and while the characters may be twodimensional the aformentioned aspects of Stagefright surpass them. Stagefright is recommended definitively.Grade A".

	schema:headline " Good Slasher Film From Michel Soavi...";
	schema:reviewBody "STAGE FRIGHT is another original take on a common theme by Italian director Michel Soavi. Typically working with common genres Soavi infuses his own stylish take on horror films which is a welcome change over many of the dull derivative knockoffs that are usually done. Soavi did the same thing with DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE another great film... where he took the zombie genre and stood it on it's head taking common themes and elements and transforming them into something new and refreshing. Although STAGE FRIGHT isn't a unique film in terms of the slasher genre Soavi makes it more fun and interesting with his own unique twists...The story is about an escaped mental patient who terrorizes a dance troupe who are locked in their rehearsal studio. Being that this is a slasher film at least partly in the classical sense the members of the troupe are knocked off onebyone in pretty original fashion.One of the main strengths in STAGE FRIGHT are Soavi's obviously intelligent and competent direction. The film has pretty high production value and the uncut DVD is transferred beautifully. My main gripe is in the sound level settings where a good bit of the dialog is very quiet and then when music plays it's exponentially louder than the dialog tracks. Not a big deal but I had to constantly adjust the volume to hear the dialog during the dialog scenes and then turn it down so that I didn't blow my ears out during scenes that had music. Speaking of the music the score is typical early 80's Italian with weird rocksynth instrumentals that sound like a weird watereddown Billy Idol song. Not my favorite choice as far as scores go but not a big deal either and pretty typical of Italian horror films of that era. The plot in STAGE FRIGHT also had some decent twists and the gore although not extremely heavy is far better than your average U.S.theatrical release. Overall one of the better of the slasher films highly recommended for fans of the genre  8.510".

There happens several bloody murders and gruesome executions . A troupe of struggling cast members is rehearsing for a smalltown production of a play. Everything seems to be as it should until one of the stage actors appears dead. In a panic the others attempt to get out only to find they are now locked in the theater with the murderous. As the other players soon have more to worry about than remembering their lines . Michele Soavi's first great success is compellingly directed with startling visual content . This frightening movie is plenty of thrills chills high bodycount and glimmer color in lurid pastel with phenomenal results . This is a classic slasher where the intrigue tension suspense appear threatening and lurking in every room corridors and stage interior and exterior . Interesting screenplay was written by 'Lew Cooper' one of numerous pseudonyms that writeractor George Eastman uses  in actuality Eastman's real name is Luigi Montefiore . The thrilling of the story is to find out which one of them committed the murder and who will get out alive.The movie belongs to Italian Giallo genre  Mario Bava Planet of vampires House of exorcism along with Riccardo Freda Secret of Dr. Hitchcock  Il Vampiri are the fundamental creators . These Giallo movies are characterized by usual zooms and utilization of imagesshock with magenta shades of ochre and overblown use of color in shining red blood  translucently pale turquoises and deep orangered . Later on  there appears Dario Argento Deep red SuspiriaInferno another essential filmmaker of classic Latino terror films and finally Michele Soavi . Soavi was given a chance as an assistant director by director Aristide Massaccesi aka Joe D'Amato. In their first film Soavi acted in an uncredited part and was the assistant director. Over four more films with Massaccesi Soavi served as a bit part actor screenwriter and personal assistant .

Although Aquarius was a boxoffice flop in Italy it was a success abroad . Despite the low budget  equivalent to under 1 million U.S. dollars and lowproduction values the picture turns out to be a passable slasher  including some exciting surprises . This genuinely mysterious story is well photographed by Tafuri though being necessary a right remastering . Furthermore  includes a poor editing involving the soundtrack by means of synthesizer  however resulting to be sometimes atmospheric and frightening musical score composed by Simon Boswell among others . The motion picture was well directed by Michael Soavi  remembered to this day as one of the many masters of Italian Horror cinema as a director screenwriter actor and assistant director. Soavi first met writerdirector Dario Argento in 1979 where the director took Soavi under his wing after learning of their same tastes with film making. Argento made Soavi the second assistant director for the movie Tenebre 1982 with Lamberto Bava as the first assistant director. Pleased with his work Bava hired Soavi as his assistant director for the mysterythriller A Blade in the Dark 1983 with Soavi in a supporting role. Afterwards Argento brought back Soavi to work as his assistant director in Phenomena 1985 with Soavi acting in a small role. Argento rewarded Soavi by giving him his first assignment as director of a music video The Valley featuring music by Bill Wyman for the movie Phenomena plus as director for a documentary on Argento's films. Soavi worked again for Lamberto Bava as assistant director in Demoni 1985 in which Soavi also appeared. Soavi began to look elsewhere for work where he was hired as an assistant director and cameraman for British actordirector Terry Gilliam with The Adventures of Baron Munchausen 1988. With new skills Soavi returned to Argento as a supervisor for special effects in pera 1987 where Argento offered him to direct another film a horror flick titled La Chiesa 1988 and filmed on location in Budapest . The international success of The Church inspired Soavi to direct another film The Sect 1990. Soavi worked on a number of screenplays and directed the horrorcomedy Cemetery Man 1994 which was a huge hit in the USA. Afterwards Soavi took a break from working to spend time with his wife and family. Recently he returned to filmmaking with two madeforItalianTV dramas . Aquarius rating  Good this is an imaginative and acceptable picture in which the camera stalks in sinister style throughout a story with magnificent visual skills.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an horror fan knows movies that truly creep you out and make you tense are far too few in existence. This film stands as one of the greatest slasher films made.Soavi doesn't use the cheap tricksexcept the black cat jump out in the beginning but I swear that was put in as a joke to gain scares he uses atmosphere and a more human killer. The sets used in this film made me giddy when scenes would start. When our heroine awakens at the end and walks out to look upon an entirely black and blue set knowing the killer is hidden somewhere in the theatre I just cringed with happiness and fear. Soavi doesn't waste our time in this one either he doesn't worry about creating a mystery of the killers identity we learn very early on much like we did in Halloween and then we start the killings. What I find so great about the film is that he doesn't try the fear involving jump outs he creates tension. That is the reason I love this film so much and why Halloween also stands as one of my top slasher flicks. He creates situations that you can imagine yourself being in and that is where the constant fear comes from. Things like the guy left behind in the freshly pitch black theatre collecting his money as the rest of the group runs off without him. Along with that we have the girl who locks herself in a dressing closet to avoid the killer in the costume room. My favorite scene though would have to be after the heroine wakes up she finds her way to the back and walks down a black and dimly lit very LONG hallway with doors on either side and the camera pans with her following each step this entire scene had my stomach jumping with delight. The killer is also human in this which is a relief. He is not all knowing with each person he kills it is entirely believable that anyone could have found them there. Whether it be from the noise they made or the fact that he was watching them all along you won't see anyone disappear and hide only to have the killer somehow be directly behind them. I am a sucker for atmosphere movies and more realistic situations if you like either check this out But you must give negative credit where it is due also so here is some of that. It seems as if with each point we reached that needed to tell a plot point in order to advance the story the plot points just don't make sense. In the beginning when the two girls decide that a minor sprained ankle is worth sneaking out to a mental institute to get it looked at just seemed like a very rushed and a kind of who cares it works idea. The director telling the girl to hide the keys was also very stupid to me why didn't he just hide them himself? Is not like he would have been tempted to leave. And the last I can think of right now when our heroine is knocked outan important point it is done so in an exceptionally lame and in a manner that makes no sense at all. There are a few more scenes that just make you say What? why?? but I guess it does work because it is minor in comparison to the rest of the film.".

Horror and Italian horror specifically has more misses than hits... and by the end of the 1980s was a dying subgenre. Soavi kept the fire alive at least for a few more years than it would have survived on its own Argento as great as he his cannot bear the entire burden of Italian cinema alone. The visually impressive part is quite true as Soavi uses colors to his advantage throughout this one... a technique he likely picked up from Argento.Fans will recognize actor John Morghen whom Harper calls waspish the darling of the Italian horror world. Sadly unlike past performances Morghen dies off relatively early in the film and is not given the onscreen death he deserves. Interestingly I read an interview with Morghen where he has trashed the horror film and its fans... one wonders why he has made so many and why he shows up at conventions throughout America. I have to give credence to Simon Boswell's rocking 1980s score. Some reviewers look back now and knock Boswell for his inclusion of heavy metal into this and other films such as Phenomena or the Demons films. Let's be clear this is not Boswell's doing. The directors at the time did this. I don't really know why. But unlike the others I don't mind it... it really gives a pumping rhythm to what could otherwise be a slowerfeeling film.Fans of horror slashers Italian films Soavi etc. all need to put this on their list. And if it doesn't already exist there needs to be a demand for a special edition disc. To my knowledge there really isn't such a thing yet and that's a shame.

Although fairly routine a bunch of useless brainless people trapped in an enclosed area which strangely enough doesn't have any fire exits being picked off by the ruthless killer with an owl mask one by one until finally having the final showdown with the final girl. In my opinion the movie is spot on like the directing the lighting and the music score. Some of the scenes in this movie I thought were great was the part when the killer sits on the stage surrounding himself with all his victims and when the final girl finds the key which is a few inches away from his feet and she has to go underneath the stage to get it which I thought was really nerve racking. On a sour note the film does sport a dumb cops parked outside filler subplot that didn't bring anything to the story except atrocious lines and failed humour. But on a whole this movie does have some faults like the acting is pretty laughable and some of they're actions in certain parts were stupid. Barbara Cupisti Alicia wasn't that great of an actress and the scene when she's supposed to have a sprained ankle but still manages to run away from the killer and climb up ladders but I still rooted for her in the end and she was the best looking babe out of the bunch. David Brandon Peter well I thought he was a bit over the top.The best thing about this movie were defiately the deaths the first death pickaxe in the mouth was definitely memorable a man getting drilled through the door is just one of the highlights such as the head chopping bit a girl getting cut in two along with some bloody stabbings.All in all this movie does have faults but if you're into Slashers that don't take themselves to seriously then try this out it's not overlong which is a good thing the suspense is high as is the body count. 710".

	schema:headline " The Best Slasher Pic of the 80'sHands Down!";
	schema:reviewBody "I won't budge on my opinion of this film!  It is the single best slasher film of the 80's.  No other film that I can think of created such a menacing downright spooky atmosphere for me.   The plot revolves around a group of actors who are rehearsing for a musical that is about a serial killer.  However the actors are unaware that a real serial killer has escaped from a near by mental hospital and has made his way to the theater by hiding in the car of one of the actresses.  The wardrobe woman is brutally murdered causing the sleazy director to take full advantage of the publicity by locking the actors in the theatre and pushing the opening of the musical to just 2 days away!  His greed turns out to be a deadly mistake when the killer locks himself in with the cast and begins picking them off on by one in very gruesome ways.  First off the custom that the killer wears a giant owl it will make sense if you see the movie is freaky as hell!  The visions of the giant owl carrying an axe down the dark corridors of the old theatre are about as scary as anything you will see in any film. But what is most effective about this film and what sets it high above any of the American counterparts that it was inspired by is the direction. Michael Soavi manages to create a dark moody and clausterphobic atmosphere that is indeed more scary and gruesome then the murders themselves.  The director really focuses on style and atmosphere rather than making the murders the focal point of the film like so many slasher movies from the 80's did.    The final showdown between the heroine and the killer and her search for the key to the outside creates an unprecedented tension for a slasher film. For coming so late in the 80's this film succeeds at what other slasher released before it Friday the 13th Prom Night My Bloody Valentine Slumber Party Massacre so desperately tried to be.  A 9.5 out of 10.  Near perfection for a slasher film.".

	schema:headline " The City as a Set the Setting as a Stage";
	schema:reviewBody "From the getgo StageFright is playing with expectations. Like many giallos we open with a working girl plying her trade on the mean streets. Out of the shadows hands emerge pulling her back. Simon Boswell's frantic electrojazz score begins playing. The killer dressed in an absurd owl mask leaps from the alleyway rolling on the ground. Everyone begins to dance in exaggerated fashion. The camera pulls back revealing the city as a set the setting as a stage. This is akin to what Mario Bava did in Black Sabbath revealing the artifice of the film format. If we read the rest of the opening in this light StageFright shows the Italian film industry in miniature. The director is an artist determined to push taboos. The financiers cares not at all for the director's vision only if his investment is returned. The actresses are pushed through the meat grinder degraded. The entire production is rushed its premire only a week away. Considering director Michele Soavi worked for years in the Italian film industry as an assistant director he can no doubt attest personally to the stuff that goes down on a low budget set.Despite its deeply European sensibilities StageFright is not a true giallo. The identity of the killer is known from the beginning while the police play a small role. Instead the film owes more to the most American of subgenres The slasher. With so many depended on formula many slashers are set apart by their setting. An empty theater proves a fantastic setting for bloody slashery. The premise is right inline with the genre A theater trope doing late night rehearsals are unknowingly locked in with a brutal killer. The unstoppable killer wears a silly mask and offs everyone in brutal ways utilizing numerous weapons. The cast is large and loosely defined. An actress is pregnant with the sound technician's child the leading man is flamboyantly gay the director is trying to sleep with all of his actresses. It's not really important. StageFright even throws in an improbable springloaded cat.Despite fitting in perfectly with its slasher brethren the style of StageFright is undeniably Italian. Soavi's studying under Argento is hugely apparent sometimes. Soavi's camera swoops around the theater taking a frantic firstperson perspective. The camera swings from a deadly pickax crashzooms on raised knives and shows red paint mingling with spilled blood. The style is Agrade. When the killer finds the work shop shown from his perspective blatantly recalls Deep Red. Soavi even directly goofs on Dario either copying or parodying the man behind a man reveal from Tenebre. Boswell's score isn't exactly Goblinesque. The mixture of hard rock and electronic tones still recalls earlier Italian genre films frequently powering the action.The film blatantly links horror with opera mixing murder and dance choreography. The kill sequences continue the Italian tradition of stylized gore. An actress is stabbed repeatedly on stage calling the audience out on their voyeurism. A man is impaled through a door with a giant spiraling drillbit gore spilling on the floor. A woman is cleaved straight in two through a floorboard a helpless body pulled out. StageFright doesn't mess around. Irving Wallace gets a chainsaw. We see an arm sawed off in clear view followed by a fullon decapitation the head rolling across the floor. For all its stylization StageFright is intensely explicitly gory.Unlike most slashers who space their kills out over a ninety minute run time Irving Wallace has eliminated most of the cast by the hour mark. Practically a very gory satire for its first hour StageFright takes a definite tonal shift. The final girl is left completely alone in a theater with a viscous serial killer. The film becomes a series of jitteringly intense nearencounters. Alicia cowers in a shower stall the killer attacking another girl in the adjacent stall. Because the design of the killer's mask you can never be sure what he's seeing. The hallways strike you as very small very tight. The theater becomes very quiet Alicia aware of how much noise she is making.One extended sequence in StageFright will always stick with me. The music drops out the camera slowly revolving around the entire auditorium. The killer arranges his victim's bodies on stage smearing each with feathers tossing a mannequin head off. Irving Wallace sits down patting the cat in his lap head down. The key to unlock door Alicia's way out of this nightmare sits in the slots of the stage. She crawls under the stage slowly trying to wiggle the key down into her arm worried about drawling the cat and the killer's attention. I truthfully without hyperbola believe it to be one of the most intense sequences ever put to film. After its torturous conclusion the scene climaxes with a phenomenal jumpscare one that always gets me no matter how many times I see the film. The catwalk encounter that follows is great as well powered by the rock score and making good use of an axe and extension cord but can't compare to the edgeofyourseat intensity of the previous scene. Even if the rest of StageFright wasn't so good the film would always be great because of that moment.The final scene returns to the earliest moments meta qualities. Soavi cribs from Argento again the protagonist remembering back to an earlier scene searching for a clue. The killer is put down shot in the head. However at the last second blood oozing from the bullet wound he looks to the camera and smiles. It's a winking acknowledgment of the clich of the immortal slasher killer as well as pointing out once again the artifice of the film format. StageFright is a very underrated Italian horror effort one of the eighties best frequently overlooked. I adore this one. Cemetery Man' is Michele Soavi's masterpiece but StageFright was the film that proved he was a master.".

	onyx:emotionText "From the getgo StageFright is playing with expectations. Like many giallos we open with a working girl plying her trade on the mean streets. Out of the shadows hands emerge pulling her back. Simon Boswell's frantic electrojazz score begins playing. The killer dressed in an absurd owl mask leaps from the alleyway rolling on the ground. Everyone begins to dance in exaggerated fashion. The camera pulls back revealing the city as a set the setting as a stage. This is akin to what Mario Bava did in Black Sabbath revealing the artifice of the film format. If we read the rest of the opening in this light StageFright shows the Italian film industry in miniature. The director is an artist determined to push taboos. The financiers cares not at all for the director's vision only if his investment is returned. The actresses are pushed through the meat grinder degraded. The entire production is rushed its premire only a week away. Considering director Michele Soavi worked for years in the Italian film industry as an assistant director he can no doubt attest personally to the stuff that goes down on a low budget set.Despite its deeply European sensibilities StageFright is not a true giallo. The identity of the killer is known from the beginning while the police play a small role. Instead the film owes more to the most American of subgenres The slasher.

When she hurts herself in show she and a friend quietly leave to get it treated mistaking a mental hospital for the real thing. Returning back feeling better a brutal murder keeps them in the building. Rehearsing still they soon discover that the murder was an escaped mental patient accidentally brought back to the studio. With the cast and crew still locked inside the slowly dwindling occupants fight back against the masked madman.The Good News This is one of the best Italian slashers around. The setting is one of the better features of the film. The building is incredible with several great stalking areas long hallways a huge stage for the production and so much more going on that there's a really great feel coming from the location. This one offers up many great moments from the location that really work well. This also has a great air about it one that feels perfectly comfortable being such a film. It doesn't stay away from any of those typical clichs. This one gets sown and dirty with being a traditional slasher film. There's a whole lot to enjoy from this one due to how much it plays by the slasher rules. That means that it puts in appearances for almost everything the genre has to offer and it makes the film seem that much more important because of it. This one also becomes more entertaining when it moves into the slasher territory since this has plenty of goodness from its slasher moments. The stalking is among the best in the genre as every single one is tense exciting and wholly interesting which is exactly what a stalking sequence should be. The chase up into the rafters is beyond glorious as there's a long battle to get there followed by several extended stalking scenes and there's even a couple of particularly brutal kills as well. This one gets more points for several scenes it doesn't seem obvious as to what's going to happen and that is a fantastic skill to having in a film much less several times within the same sequence. A later scene where the killer attacks a group of victims who have locked themselves inside a small room is another standout scene. The first murder is also a highly enjoyable suspense scene as there's so much to love about the scene with the ridiculously suspenseful build up to the nearlyinvisible cover the pouring rain provides to the false shocks and the final one delivers huge. Another rather huge one is killing the actress on the stage in front of everyone simply because they never show the switch onscreen and then when the play starts the reversal is glorious. None though can top the suspense bestowed upon the real highlight of the film where the killer is perched on a stage with a victim below trying to get a key stuck in the floor without them noticing it. This is just unbearably suspenseful and is just nervewrangling to the extreme and contains so many great moments that it just becomes all the better. There's even more creepy moments in here that it really does set the movie on edge. Even though the mask is a little weird it's unique enough to make it original and memorable that fits in with everything that's going on and gives the film a sense of separation from the others out there. The last really big plus is it's blood and gore. The kills here are outandout graphic where one is pulled into view from below sawed in half at the waist with a chainsaw repeatedly hacked with an ax decapitated with an ax drilled through the stomach with an electric drill set on fire and stabbed in the stomach among so much more. These here all make it that much more important.The Bad News This one here only has one flaw in it and that's the ending. This here doesn't feel at all like an effective ending coming across more as a prologue to a sequel minus the killer losing the fight and really should've ended it with her being carted away by the authorities. It doesn't fit in well with the rest of the movie and still would've been the perfect amount for a slasher. Still though this was not enough to deter the full effect of the film.The Final Verdict With a lot to really love about this one and only an incredibly useless flaw this is one of the best of the genre. Highly recommended to all Italian or giallo fans as well as those into the late 80s slasher scene while those who aren't that into any are urged to use this as a starting point for how great the scenes are.Rated URR Graphic Violence Language and Brief Nudity".

This is a musical documentary at first and not a closer look as to who or what Michael Jackson was.An argument could be made that Lee decided to focus all his energy to the musical genius that Jackson was and how hard he worked to finish an album such as Bad including his any skills. The man was composing producing writing the songs choreographing his videos singing and dancing live vocal arranging and beatboxing! It is a shame that the album itself had to endure endless criticism for not reaching the levels of Thriller and at that period it was considered a disappointment despite selling more than 30 million copies worldwide and being accompanied by the most successful tour of all time.After 25 years though Bad is considered one of the best albums out there a record unparalleled in terms of hits and quality balance. Bad is a record richer than Thriller with less filler and more meat. Lee's interviews raw footage and behind the scenes tactics prove just that. Taking a massive 5 year period to be recorded with hundreds of finished demos lots of artistic input and various musical collaborations Bad now gets the treatment and much awaited spotlight it deserves. Bad 25 celebrates the rich sound that Jackson's third solo record contained along with diverse musical engineering and craftmanship. The album has so many hits on so many levels  the short film of Smooth Criminal the anti gravity lean the West Side Story dance number of Bad the rock gritty sound of Dirty Diana with Steve Stevens' input the psychedelic vibe in Leave me alone and the powerful anthem of Man in the mirror are just cases that display suggest and reveal a creative and hard working genius at the peak of his game.It is really sad that people still tend to emphasize any negative or controversial aspects that Jackson may had. But the musical one is not one of them. For he remains at the pantheon of the most brilliant musicians and performers ever to walk the earth and perhaps the greatest. And we cannot take that away from him. Ever".

That film makes Bad 25 look especially like secondhand news as an array of musicians technicians sound engineers and others weigh in on MJ's followup to the stillreigning highestselling album of all time in Thriller. One by one the songs on Bad are broken down into the stories of how they came to be produced while it is noted throughout that at that point in his adulthood MJ was becoming a savvy businessman. I especially like the stuff from those who knew MJ at the time of the recording while hangerson Justin Bieber Kanye and Chris Brown all received boos at the Toronto screening during TIFF. In This Is It we get right up close to the King of Pop so having a doc with a bunch of people telling us about him just doesn't resonate as fully and to my surprise there is a lot of talking in this movie compared with the amount of music in it. This is not a bad movie. It made me nostalgic for my youth and to want to hear these songs in full. And of course MJ's passing has only increased the shivers I get when I hear that choir go man in the mirruh! but as far as music docs go this is pretty much par for the course.".

These particular hit and short film took Michael's popularity to a whole new range around the globe maybe it didn't make it in US but it was the most international single from the album.

Even though especially the footage of the making of 'Bad' and the origins of other songs were great to see and very interesting some of the interviews with celebrities were not. People like Justin Bieber and Mariah Carey did not have a lot to contribute and for me the tearjerking question 'where were you when you heard about Michael's death?' followed by a montage of celebrities looking down tearing up etc could have been left out. It is important to pay a tribute to the King of Pop of course but it could have been done in a tighter and 'smoother' way. It reminded me too much of some MTV 'The Rise  Rise of..' format. The style of the film talking head weird cross zoom rotate fade original footage talking head was also part the reason why to me it felt it should have ended about twenty minutes before it did.".

	schema:headline " A Documentary To Beat All Other Michael Jackson Documentaries";
	schema:reviewBody "Bad25 is going to appeal to the Michael Jackson fan. It casts some much needed light on the creative process the led to the finished Bad album. This documentary will not appeal to those who want to learn more about Michael's private life especially his eccentricities. It was interesting that the buying of the Beatles catalogue may have led to some of the junk journalism. Some junk journalism was released by people in Michael's group. If this is indeed the case it backfired badly for Jackson. The documentary is a standard example of a factual documentary with a lot of talking heads. I feel that Justin Bieber Mariah Carey Kanye West Chris Brown and Cee LoGreen and maybe one or two others were unnecessary addins. They added little to the story though with Mariah it was funny to hear she had two dresses reminiscent of a Thumbtzen dress in the late 1980's. Little things like that are nice to hear in my opinion. I have grown impatient with the amount of focus on Michael's private life. I'm a scientist and if I have learned anything it is this. Outside of science all you have is a court of law which examines the available evidence. The general public have no right in my opinion to judge a person upon junk journalism. I remember in the documentary The Michael Jackson Story Seb Fontaine narrator pointed out at the beginning of the documentary that it is easy to forget what all the fuss was about in the first place it was of course his music. It is really sad that some people have actually forgotten why Jackson became famous in the first place. This documentary reminds us of a man driven by passion for music driven by a passion to surpass himself musically driven by a passion to entertain. He was a workaholic and he deserves credit for his hard work. It was not easy and few people remember this when they critically examine his music. There was one part of the documentary which fell down considerably. That was the discussion of the song Just Good Friends. It was considered a coffee break between Liberian Girl and The Way You Make Me Feel. I don't understand why. I like it. This documentary will bring people back to the man and his music. Buy the DVD Watch it and leave your junk journalism down forever.".

	schema:headline " BAD25 A Great Tribute to the King of Pop";
	schema:reviewBody "I had a chance to see 'BAD25' this past weekend at Yale University's Whitney Humanities Center. By the end of the 2 12 hour viewing I was in tears. Seeing Michael not in his last days before his untimely demise re 'This Is It' but during the momentous development of the followup album to the groundbreaking record breaking Thriller album was a treat for real Michael Jackson fans. An emotional roller coaster that allowed you to laugh out loud at the anecdotes shared in one moment and listen in wonder during another. For real music fans like Spike Lee who grew up surrounded by musical talent and raised by a musician watching the process for developing this album was a rare treat and a superior lesson in what it takes to harness the genius of an artist. Spike perfectly wove together interviews with Jackson's longtime collaborators his sound engineer Bruce Swedien super star composer Quincy Jones his long time musicians choreographers and other collaborators with those of present day artists that have been inspired by and owe much of their success to Michael Jackson's influence and legacy. Interspersed between those segments you get to see Michael at work. You witness his work ethic and all that inspired him to entice his audience visually. His short films not videos were as dear to him as the music he made. Spike was approached to do this documentary to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the release of the 'Bad' album. I remember where I was when I heard the first single. I was away at school living in Washington D.C. I remember staying up late to watch his videos. I remember what it was like to hear 'Liberian Girl' for the first time. When you watch this documentary not only do you get to relive each of those moments but you get to understand why you were so touched and affected by each song and each short film. A tremendous amount of work and nuance went into each recording. Bruce Swedien took us through the simple and yet unappreciated ways in which he was able to help create specific sounds for each song. Many amateurs will lament this approach because they do not understand MJ's influence. People will decry the use of old footage of Michael in concert but if you get to view it again you will understand. The Michael we knew and grew up loving was more himself during that time in his life than he was in the weeks and even months leading up to his death. Michael was suffering terribly from his addiction and was surrounded by those willing to aid him in that addiction. Painfully his family stood by helpless which is typical when dealing with an addict.Spike Lee very cleverly showed the reactions as he asked each person where they were when they heard that Michael Jackson had passed away. I too remember where I was when I heard the 'rumor'. That's what I called it because I did not believe it. Did not want to believe it. And as many said like Danyel Smith during the interview 'still can't believe it'. Spike spoke to the audience after the viewing ended. He explained why the last segment of the documentary was dedicated to the making of the song Man In The Mirror written by the incredible singer  song writer Siedah Garrett. In short he explained to us in so much as when John Lennon died and 'Imagine' dominated the airwaves Man in the Mirror stood out as the song that represented this icon. All of his songs were played but Man in the Mirror is the anthem that touches us all. I dare anyone not to tear up during those last 10 minutes. I want to thank Spike Lee for allowing us to revisit 1987. I can not think of a more perfect tribute to MJ and those who were lucky enough to work with him. And I feel especially lucky to have shared the experience of the documentary with my young nephew who loved every minute of it. A budding but true Michael Jackson fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "NOTE This is a review of the sixtyfour minute snippet of Spike Lee's Bad 25 that aired on ABC on November 22 2012. The original film is about two hours and eleven minutes and is scheduled to be released on DVD in February 2013. When available I will publish a new review of the full length film which will be mixed points from this review along with newly established ones.Every artist big or small comes billed with their own projected style or personal feature. Gene Simmons had his tongue Madonna had her dresses but Michael Jackson had his moves and his groove music executive Andre Harrell tells us in Spike Lee's muchanticipated Bad 25. Just watching an old video of Michael Jackson performing live and dancing on stage inspires all sorts of reactions among the old and the young. His talents are unforgettable his music touching in the way words can not describe and eternal much like his spirit.We begin by welcoming expected statistics to the table Michael Jackson's album Thriller is the best selling album in music history how do you follow it up? With another fantastic record that boasts five singles all of which charting number one. That album of course is the iconic Bad released in 1987 with a cover boasting Michael staring at you in a black leather jumpsuit with several silver buckles and the five singles being I Just Can't Stop Loving You Bad Man in the Mirror The Way You Make Me Feel and Dirty Diana. After those backtoback successes you can bet that pretty much every tune off the album became its own single.Followed up are a variety of interviews from modern stars such as Mariah Carey Chris Brown and Kanye West and a number of artists and composers that had firsthand experience with Michael such as his main producer Quincy Jones and Tatiana Thumbtzen who costarred with him in the music video for The Way You Make Me Feel where she remarks fondly about how Michael was so shy and vulnerable leading the director of the short film to change the ending from a kiss to a simple hug. I say short film purely for the spirit of Michael Jackson he never liked to call the video counterparts for his songs music videos but short films and they definitely played like one. The only modern artist I can think of that tries to tag on a story with her videos is Lady Gaga but even she can't embody the true sense of power and bombastic greatness of the king of pop.Quite possibly the most interesting segment in the film is the footage we get behind the scenes of the Bad short film shoot with acclaimed director Martin Scorsese manning the camera. In front of it are not only Michael Jackson with a band of young highlyskilled choreographers but Wesley Snipes in a debut role as the one peer pressuring Michael before he exclaims loudly and proudly that he is bad. But not criminally bad bad as in cool he says.Another short film shoot we explore is the production of the kinetic infectious anthem Smooth Criminal which just so happens to be one of my favorite Michael Jackson songs. We see how deeply and closely the short mimics the film noir style of pictures like The Third Man with its heavy use of shadow and color. In its entirety the short is expertly crafted and the music is beautifully sung and like mentioned in the film is completely worth it to see the Smooth Criminal lean where Michael and his group of dancers lean forward to the point of almost appearing horizontal.Bad 25 will suffer by comparison to Michael Jackson film greats like Michael Jackson's Moonwalker and Michael Jackson's This Is It. It's difficult to top those cherished pictures mainly because it shows Michael as a living breathing human and what we're left with is to remember him through archived concert footage and the hundreds of interviews he gave in his heyday. I'm giving this cut of the documentary three stars only as a placeholder because I can sense that it is heavily cut and a large part of the exploration in the five singles feels rather slim. To judge this entire project solely on the viewing of the hourlong special we were fortunate to get is a little disheartening and unfair. I haven't seen the half of it  literally.Starring Michael Jackson Jermaine Jackson Quincy Jones Martin Scorsese Cee Lo Green Chris Brown Mariah Carey Kanye West Sheryl Crow and Tatiana Thumbtzen. Directed by Spike Lee.".

Granted the acting is choppy as it clearly jumps between the kids being themselves and then saying scripted lines. But the characters are real. The most poignant point of the film was that murders are taking place in impoverished neighborhoods just a short bus ride away from the multimillion dollar homes and cushy lifestyles of Beverly Hills. The story was weak and lacked fluidity but the reality of the characters made up for it twofold. With the exception of the preppy kids who seemed a bit forced the characters are all spot on for how LA kids today truly are. And the graphic descriptions of sexuality are not exaggerations. If you want to know exactly what the innercity youth look like today look no further than Wassup Rockers. This film is a must see for anyone who intends to work with kids especially in an urban environment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Larry Clark is one of the rare active filmmakers in North Americaand in the worldwho makes films that are overwhelmingly important and immediate. Though on the surface his subjects are not openly political nor full of grand pretenses his films are among the most vital portraits of the cultural political and social landscape of North America in recent years. In Wassup Rockers Clark the leading infant terrible of world cinema has perhaps created his greatest polemic. He has put his fists down. After the roars of rage of his two previous films Bully and the masterpiece Ken Park the filmmaker lets more tenderness into his scenes than ever before. Ken Park certainly had moments of great tenderness often between shocking moments the concluding sex scene which has been hailed by some as the most moving sex scene in cinema certainly comes to mind but Wassup Rockers has a different sense of tenderness. This portrait of punkrock Latino solidarity of Salvadorian and Guatemalan refugees in South Central Los Angeles who belong only in their own worlds is poetic and inspiring like all of Larry Clark's films it is most beautiful in its portrait of the ugliness with which the world treats the wretched of the world perhaps because it provides us with a sense of reality that we recognize. Like Kids Wassup Rockers is set during one eventful symbolic or completely meaningless day in which they decide to visit the white man's world of which they can only imagine like all oppressed people think of their oppressors. Just wanting to skateboard a fetish of Clark's in the luxurious parts of Los Angeles is enough to change their world as they battle bigot after bigot and are exposed to the extreme violence that lies beneath the surface of bourgeois comfort. There is one extraordinary scene between one of the boys who like all of the other main actors in the film is a nonprofessional more or less playing himself whose character like the others even has his own name and a wealthy girl that he meets both try and have a conversation with one another but they are never really able to communicate to penetrate and to break through the walls of social class that separate them they speak different languages one speaks of constant struggle the other of comfort one speaks of death the other speaks of knowing only life one speaks of friends the other speaks of brothers of comrades in arms. The images sometimes extraordinary for the sake of being so real are made even more powerful by the blaring punk rock which provides an incredible rhythm for the film instilling in the film an unmerciful and energetic musical counterpart to the proletariat struggle depicted in the images of the film. As always though a simple analysis of a Larry Clark film tends to never really capture his incredible sense of ambiance because his objective is not to make a statement about anything that can be easily understood cerebrally but to understand these kids who live in constant marginalization without realizing it who didn't choose the conditions in which they live but face them fearlessly collectively like a tribe going into battle fighting together.".

	schema:headline " Upbeat Mainstream comedy  Not Typical Clark";
	schema:reviewBody "If I were to summarize this film in short I'd have to call it a Comedy that is somewhat like a mainstream version of KIDS.I've been a fan of coming of age films for many years. I've seen all of Clark's work along with numerous international films such as Pixote Nunmal TimelessBottomless and many many other films that fall within the genre. What I've always found appealing about Clarks work is the bleak outlook and hopeless feeling you'd get after watching his films. Even while many criticized Ken Park for being more shock then substance it still gave me that feeling that KIDS did. This is what I had hoped for going into Wassup Rockers. I wasn't really concerned with the shock value of say a Ken Park but I was looking for that same feeling I got after watching Kids.I didn't get that feeling.Now while watching Wassup Rockers I'd find it hard to believe one couldn't make comparisons to KIDS. The movie opens with the camera pointed at a young boy named Jonathan who basically outlines what we're about to see over the remained of the film. He talks about his friends and their habits and the types of things he does or sees on a daily basis. It's very reminiscent of the begging of KIDS when Telly's commentary starts the film off discussing girls. You then have various scenes depicting some of the activities the youth get into. In KIDS you've see the skateboarding the drinking the blunt rolling and the girls.. In Wassup you see pretty much the same minus the drugs and drinking something there is NONE OF in this film. You do however get a scene in which two males are talking about their first time much like the scene in KIDS when Rosario Dawson and Chloe were in the bedroom with two friends discussing oral sex. It's not that this is a KIDS 'remake' more than it just felt very similar in terms of the content.Now for the things that failed. First this has to be the worst acted film Clark has worked on. I understand and appreciate the fact he found these kids in South Central on the street but there were times in which the acting was so poor it just wasn't believable. I just couldn't believe one of the confrontations between a group of African Americans and the crew for example. It almost seemed like someone was standing off to the side waving say something!. When speaking after the film Clark mentioned that the script was a mere 32 pages and a lot was improve and that would explain some of the acting. Think about this for a second. You found a group of kids who have never acted before and you ask them to improvise the majority of the script. While I'll admit this makes the film feel genuine at times it also makes it feel forced at times as well. I'm also not sure how many Clark fans will find his 'upbeat' feel to be a positive change. One of the audience members asked what happened to you? even stating that this film is a feel good filmnothing like you've ever done before upon which Clark responded by saying I've done Ken Park That's as far as I can go with that. I wanted to do something newsomething different and he has. The problem is I liked Larry Clark for that reason and now I question if he'll ever go back. There is even a parody of Clint Eastwood in the movie suggesting that it be taken light heatedly.With all of that being said I still think this is a big accomplishment for Clark. In my opinion he went back to the film that started it all and created it in a format that could be enjoyed by more people. His discussed his experience at Cannes and the TIFF a year prior when introducing Ken Park as well. He wanted to be able to reach out to these fans he had yet he couldn't due to their ages and his films ratings. Another one of his comments however may be a little more insightful into the real reason this film was made when he stated This was the hardest film for me to make. In elaborating on the reasons he touched on a few things one being investments. He suggested investors had written him off because they considered him crazy so it was very hard to get backing. Almost like nobody wanted to risk taking a chance on Clark after Ken Park. I myself wonder if this wasn't the real purpose of this film. He needed a film that could make some money so he could continue to be a director. Some may refer to this as being a Sell out type film but I won't be that harsh. I can see this film playing in small theatres in the US to be honest and I don't see any reason why it wouldn't get an official DVD release in the US also something Ken Park has never experienced. I just can't seem to grasp the idea that one of the more controversial directors in America today has decided to create was seems to be an upbeat mainstream comedybut hell who am I? So where does that leave it? I didn't enjoy it as much as KIDS nor do I think it's as good a movie. I'd also argue Bully was better overall. Ken Park on the other hand would make the more interesting debate. Ken Park was more memorable and enjoyable to me but Wassup Rockers had a lot more substance to it. I guess that means I'm also guilty of the shock value Clark films can offer something Wassup Rockers has left behind.A good film indeed but not typical Larry Clark. You can decide if that's a good or bad thing".

There is even a parody of Clint Eastwood in the movie suggesting that it be taken light heatedly.With all of that being said I still think this is a big accomplishment for Clark. In my opinion he went back to the film that started it all and created it in a format that could be enjoyed by more people. His discussed his experience at Cannes and the TIFF a year prior when introducing Ken Park as well. He wanted to be able to reach out to these fans he had yet he couldn't due to their ages and his films ratings. Another one of his comments however may be a little more insightful into the real reason this film was made when he stated This was the hardest film for me to make. In elaborating on the reasons he touched on a few things one being investments. He suggested investors had written him off because they considered him crazy so it was very hard to get backing. Almost like nobody wanted to risk taking a chance on Clark after Ken Park. I myself wonder if this wasn't the real purpose of this film. He needed a film that could make some money so he could continue to be a director. Some may refer to this as being a Sell out type film but I won't be that harsh. I can see this film playing in small theatres in the US to be honest and I don't see any reason why it wouldn't get an official DVD release in the US also something Ken Park has never experienced. I just can't seem to grasp the idea that one of the more controversial directors in America today has decided to create was seems to be an upbeat mainstream comedybut hell who am I? So where does that leave it? I didn't enjoy it as much as KIDS nor do I think it's as good a movie. I'd also argue Bully was better overall. Ken Park on the other hand would make the more interesting debate. Ken Park was more memorable and enjoyable to me but Wassup Rockers had a lot more substance to it. I guess that means I'm also guilty of the shock value Clark films can offer something Wassup Rockers has left behind.A good film indeed but not typical Larry Clark. You can decide if that's a good or bad thing";

This means no more flying semen or murdered grandparents. This is a story about kids from the ghetto who don't quite fit in in the hood and definitely don't fit into mainstream whitebread America but that's all okay with them cause they have their freedom and they have each other. I applaud Clark on this one. If you're a fan of the gratuitous 17 and under sex scenes then look elsewhere Clark get the sex scenes done this time without going over the top. They're actually there as part of the story and not in the film for shock factor. Bottom line amazing flick and I hope it gets mainstream distribution. Of all his films this one has the best shot of actually getting decent box office exposure.".

But his portrayals are often so racy and exploitative for most of today's youth that the viewer can sometimes get confused with what of the content is based on reality and what is just Clark's semiperverted imagination. Wassup Rockers is a mindnumbing stream of consciousness story about Mexican kids who dress like punk rockerstight jeans uncut hair live in south central Los Angeles and skate Beverly HillsHollywood for kicks. Their misadventures include getting funky with white girls crashing a rich hipster party and getting shot by Charlton Heston. Gee sounds like some sort of counterculture masterpiece right? Well not quite. Of course like other Clark movies the kids aren't actors they don't act. Most of them just kind of take up space. The worst part is the 10 minute long improv conversation between Kiko and one of the white girls in her bedroom. At best it could be compared to a schoolroom skit on diversity but not convincing movie material in the least. The rest of the movie is just awkward and disorienting. Though I thought it god awful I couldn't help but laugh hysterically at the completely accurate portrayals of wealthy hipster kids. Go see Wassup Rockers if you love skate montages and madeonthespot hardcore punk songs. The majority of the movie is said scenes. If you're not a fan however don't waste the 8 dollars.".

But then finally something started to take shape the film is if about something a class tale with the South Central Hispanics roaming around Beverly Hills just looking for a place to skate and getting into various misadventures some funny some deadly. And at the same time even more than Kids there's a raw quality to the performances with mixed results. It's like that docudrama Streetwise from the 80s with a touch of Ferris Bueller and then put to a soundtrack of ripoffs or soundalikes of the Casualties.Part of the problem of Wassup Rockers is that it is not too interesting within its aimless structure. Having a film without much of a plot can work fine they're made all the time in independent quarters in America and especially Europe. But it should amount to something by the end and by the end of Wassup Rockers there isn't very much of a point except well don't go into Beverly Hills for too long if you're Hispanic and looking like a member of the Ramones by way of Tony Hawk. But within this jumparound structure around some of the random sex scenes and skateboarding and the kind of cool scenes of the kids riding their boards to LA punk rock Clark does create a fun Bmovie. At the least it's never boring and if it isn't really groundbreaking or as revelatory or whatever as Kids and it isn't it does provide something of a small window into something we haven't seen before or at least I haven't seen before.Not all of the performances are below par an in fact there's a charm and down to earth honesty to a lot of scenes a scene that made me think a lot of Streetwise is when the kid Chico is talking to the Beverly Hills girl in their underwear in her bedroom  this is stripped down to the point of simple documentary and it suddenly becomes affecting strangely enough. And if nothing else it works as a B movie a kidsontheprowl story that should appeal most to anyone who likes to just roam around when they have nothing to do when they're 14 or 15. It's a minor work that has moments of real power.".

These films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. Kids exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among the young. Bully touched upon similar issues. Ken Park dealt somewhat hamhandedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui. Irrefutably all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouth.Wassup Rockers is about a group of poor Hispanic skateboarders from SouthCentral Las Angeles who go to arbitrarily go to Beverly Hills to skate. That's it.Wassup Rockers is nothing.It has no substance. It has an essentially nonexistent narrative. And like Kids it features a cast of firsttime actors who were drawn out of the films setting. However unlike Kids none of them have any semblance of talent. There is better acting in porn. This film features without a doubt the most terrible performances I've ever seen in a feature film. One can respect Larry Clark to exposing these young men to the filmmaking process but these kids are absolutely cringeworthy folks. Might I add that apparently these gents also produced the soundtrack which features some of the most dismally inept garage punk you'll ever hear my advice is to pop a couple of migraine pills before you enter the theater or you'll regret it afterward.But then again it's not like they had much of a script to work with. Every line that is uttered is a contrived patheticallydelivered and irritating beyond all measure. The story itself is ludicrous. It starts out reasonably enough but soon slips quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity. This begins of course with a capricious sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls followed by a series of clichd National Lampoonish encounters characters being killed off for no reason and finally resulting in a ridiculous anticlimax. Shots go on much longer than they need to. Be prepared to watch people fall of skateboards for about fifteen minutes straight overlong lingering shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding down streets. But then again with the script at a scant 32 pages they need as much useless filler as possible. Perhaps Wassup Rockers would have worked better as a short film.Anyways I could go on like this. This is the worst film Larry Clark has made yet. For those of you who are interested in seeing a Clark movie if only for his shocking pederast antics look elsewhere. This is by far the tamest film he's made yet and it's also the worst. It's flat out horrible. Like Uwe Boll horrible. Definitely the worst one I saw at the festival.110".

The other thing most people don't get is this movie was a lot like the Laramie Project. It was borderline documentary which is what it should have been. Plus them white boys getting their asses beat was the best fight in a long time. The movie was also very real. So many other Punk movies portray us as these bumbling heroes with no place to go but this is how its like. This and Suburbia are the only movies out there worth a damn for this lifestyle.

South Central is not at Redondo Beach... but that is small time. He poetically captures the feel of the metro on the freeway unique. He could have filmed a bit more when the kids head down into the new Supercamp Metro station at Hollywood and Vine. The Oscars used to be handed out right there at the Pantages and it is the last thing you see going down into the metro if you turn around and look back across Hollywood Blvd the first thing when you come up out the vast new metro system there too. In a way this is Clark's homage to Hollywood and all of that. If you want a quick study of L.A.'s many minorities ride the new Metro lines. It is cheap cheap cheap and fun. Loved the way the kids all corrected everybody about their origins this is not after all a film about East L.A. which has been there forever it is about the kids of the Central Americans maids etc. who live in South Central on the way to Long Beach. The actor with the gun looked so much sounded so much like the middle generation motorcycle guy of the famous Hollywood acting Dynasty famed for Grapes of Wrath Barbarella They Shoot Horses Don't They that i was surprised to check the credits just now and learn that it was not Mr. Peter in the role of the man with the gun in his back yard. Maybe it really was Mr. Peter but too shy to admit it. Do not go to this film expecting to find a story out of the Garden of Earthly Delights which Hollywood now knows about after so many day trips to the Prado. A Kellerman story complete with gay friendliness this definitely is NOT. On the other hand there is no Gay Unfriendliness either. Enjoy............".

I understand throwing in one or two characters like this perhaps to make some kind of point about the way that teenage girls have internalized their own intense sexualization by contemporary society but ALL of the female characters? I found this very problematic and sad for young women especially. It gave me the sense that the movie was turning these boys into victim heroes at the expense of women along with all the other race and class forces arrayed against the boys. I am sure that the girls growing up in the South Central neighborhood where these boys hail from are going through as many or more struggles as the boys. A truly authentic portrayal will represent that instead of portraying women of all classes as predatory promiscuous creatures without any other facets to their characters.".

They end up opening the eyes of a group of rich and spoiled young girls getting chased by the police getting attacked by jealous jocks and everyone else that they come across both gay and straight end up all either falling in love with them or being admirers of them. A couple people end up actually dying too! This film has everything!!!! No but seriously the plot of this film may sound kind of like a cross between Ferris Bueller's Day Off and The Warriors which isn't far from the truth. I'd almost call it a remake of The Warriors if I weren't such a purist. Either way though I had so much fun with this film. Within ten minutes I ended up falling in love with all these boys and I especially loved how genuine they are about everything. They consistently remain true to each other which is so rare in youthrelated films today. They are all brave and good natured. They aren't violent they don't do drugs and they are charming in a weird way. I would probably not be bothered by the idea of them hanging out with my nephew. They really lend a lot of energy to the film which helps the film stay more focused on the surroundings rather than plot and this really isn't the kind of film that should have a plot or at least a complicated one.This film likely won't be everyone's cup of tea. The subject matter relating to gang violence punk rock and skateboarding will not appeal to a lot of viewers. In addition to that most will not appreciate the blatant stereotypes of all the characters surrounding this group of boys. I personally was not bothered by most of it. I felt that it somewhat helped define the characters a little bit more by allowing them to roam in an environment that wasn't reality and was somewhat simple. I did find the one scene with the Charlton Heston lookalike to be a little too tasteless but I was too entertained and fascinated by what was going on to really be much bothered by it.I think that this is one of Larry Clark's strongest films. It's not quite as good as BULLY but it's not really the same kind of film either. WASSUP ROCKERS is really more of an entertainment picture. This is pretty much Larry Clark's lightest and most positive film though when the darker situations come into play Larry Clark goes all the way with it. WASSUP ROCKERS is entertaining moving scary hilarious and bizarre. It's very fast paced so even if you dislike the film it will be out of your system before you know it. In short this is a great film and I applaud Larry Clark for pulling off such a fun film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wassup Rockers is a marginally amusing exercise in the world of delinquents and underprivileged youth but I am instantly reminded of the director's Larry Clark other works such as Bully and Kids which were far far superior to this film. The film plays like a tired rehash of previously fresh ideas and while we understand that Clark has a deep fascination and understanding of the teenage wasteland that currently exists today we are unsure how much longer he can keep the idea going.The film focuses on a group of Guatemalan and Salvadoran skaters in Southern Los Angeles that rebel against conventional society by not conforming to the simpleminded hiphop style and music their gangdriven neighborhood happily enjoys. The teens are often referred to as rockers as they wear skintight jeans listen to heavy metal and punk music and proudly wear their hair long and thick. We follow them as they wander aimlessly from skatepark to skatepark looking for excitement and thrills as well as some much needed escapism. They wind up being fish out of water when they take a trip to the 90210 culture of Beverly Hills where they meet two lovely young women who allow them to stop by their house any time. This is the domino to the trigger of catastrophic events that are likely to and will unfold.A third of the film is devoted to getting to vaguely know these faces and show how they operate in their skating world the other is devoted to showing how they associate with the upperclass when they hail from the ghetto and the remaining third shows them acting under pressure and fear. Tonally the film is confused widely uneven and unable to keep a solid shift through the day's events without gradually throwing in a curveball.The characters have some recognizable substance to them but they are sort of cardboard stereotypes despite the film's efforts to try and lead them away from that common clich. The film teeters on the edge of these kids opening up but it quickly becomes rambling directionless monologues instead of truly insightful pieces. It is also fair to say that all of the teenactors do an admirable job at working with the script and many if not all of them are first time actors showcasing truly remarkable talents in central roles.The film's main goal is to try and put ongoing tensions between class differences and racerelations on the spot. It succeeds in many of its initial goals and doesn't come off as heavyhanded or overly preachy. Try saying the same about Crash.Many shots incorporate heavy rock music with montages and long shots of skateboarding. This is where the film shines as a whole. It is welcoming to see this human appearance and Clark has shot long instances of events previously mainly in his film Kids. Honestly it seems as if Wassup Rockers plays like a watered down neutered version of that film. I truly admired Kids for its consistency bravery and screenplay which bled poignancy and sadness but Wassup Rockers can't even come close to approaching the chords that film hit effortlessly. Clark has said a lot about the teenage youth in the past but he doesn't use this effort to say much of anything provocative.Starring Jonathan Velasquez Francisco Pedrasa Milton Velasquez and Yunior Usualdo Panameno. Directed by Larry Clark.".

The film plays like a tired rehash of previously fresh ideas and while we understand that Clark has a deep fascination and understanding of the teenage wasteland that currently exists today we are unsure how much longer he can keep the idea going.The film focuses on a group of Guatemalan and Salvadoran skaters in Southern Los Angeles that rebel against conventional society by not conforming to the simpleminded hiphop style and music their gangdriven neighborhood happily enjoys. The teens are often referred to as rockers as they wear skintight jeans listen to heavy metal and punk music and proudly wear their hair long and thick. We follow them as they wander aimlessly from skatepark to skatepark looking for excitement and thrills as well as some much needed escapism. They wind up being fish out of water when they take a trip to the 90210 culture of Beverly Hills where they meet two lovely young women who allow them to stop by their house any time. This is the domino to the trigger of catastrophic events that are likely to and will unfold.A third of the film is devoted to getting to vaguely know these faces and show how they operate in their skating world the other is devoted to showing how they associate with the upperclass when they hail from the ghetto and the remaining third shows them acting under pressure and fear. Tonally the film is confused widely uneven and unable to keep a solid shift through the day's events without gradually throwing in a curveball.The characters have some recognizable substance to them but they are sort of cardboard stereotypes despite the film's efforts to try and lead them away from that common clich. The film teeters on the edge of these kids opening up but it quickly becomes rambling directionless monologues instead of truly insightful pieces. It is also fair to say that all of the teenactors do an admirable job at working with the script and many if not all of them are first time actors showcasing truly remarkable talents in central roles.The film's main goal is to try and put ongoing tensions between class differences and racerelations on the spot. It succeeds in many of its initial goals and doesn't come off as heavyhanded or overly preachy. Try saying the same about Crash.Many shots incorporate heavy rock music with montages and long shots of skateboarding. This is where the film shines as a whole. It is welcoming to see this human appearance and Clark has shot long instances of events previously mainly in his film Kids. Honestly it seems as if Wassup Rockers plays like a watered down neutered version of that film. I truly admired Kids for its consistency bravery and screenplay which bled poignancy and sadness but Wassup Rockers can't even come close to approaching the chords that film hit effortlessly. Clark has said a lot about the teenage youth in the past but he doesn't use this effort to say much of anything provocative.Starring Jonathan Velasquez Francisco Pedrasa Milton Velasquez and Yunior Usualdo Panameno. Directed by Larry Clark.";

He portrays adolescents in a way no other film maker can his movies are often gritty and probably provide for the most authentic depiction of youngsters growing up in tough neighbourhoods. Wassup Rockers could have been made by someone else. It has probably the most ridiculous storyline of any movie I have ever seen and it genuinely has stunned me that the same person who made Ken Park has churned out this waste of a movie. I can only assume Clarke was told to tone it down with this movie and given 20 as the budget and half an hour to make it. It genuinely is that bad when it ended I was glad until I realised I wasted 2 hours of my life watching such garbage.".

It wasn't very gory at all lest someone believes blood to be very gory. If it were longer and had more scenes I believe it would be way better. Being a 2005 movie the computer graphic parts could have been way better there were some cheesy parts that just made me giggle. I'm certainly not used to Japanese horror movies because American's rely mainly on suspense. They should have given a few of those actors a bit more air time and not everyone should have died. The main guy should have gotten out of it alive but thats my opinion he was cute after all. I rented the movie but I certainly would buy it any chance I got. I like it enough though two thumbs up.".

	onyx:emotionText "It was a really good movie. It kept me guessing and trying to figure out what happens. A few things weren't answered though so I counted against that. It wasn't very gory at all lest someone believes blood to be very gory. If it were longer and had more scenes I believe it would be way better. Being a 2005 movie the computer graphic parts could have been way better there were some cheesy parts that just made me giggle. I'm certainly not used to Japanese horror movies because American's rely mainly on suspense. They should have given a few of those actors a bit more air time and not everyone should have died. The main guy should have gotten out of it alive but thats my opinion he was cute after all. I rented the movie but I certainly would buy it any chance I got. I like it enough though two thumbs up.";

Well it isn't as simple as that in this intriguing ghost story whose ambition outweighs it's execution. The setting is a nowclosed down school where our couple believe to be a good enough place to hold a child hostage until they get paid. But as the story develops we get an understanding of who this spooky girl really is. But not just that..we find out who REALLY done the selecting to begin with. Right away the girl shows an eerie attachment to Mitsuru. She doesn't want him to leave her but often plays disappearing acts with Mitsuru and Maki. The first fifteen or so minutes shows them trying to find her throughout the halls but we soon find that it isn't they who do the finding but she who allows them to see her. Soon Mitsuru's buddies come to the school but how they got their information of this location comes in play with a plot twist that changes the whole relationship between our couple's life together. An important thematic element..YasudaMitsuyoshi Shinodais the major source of conflict and his relationship with a certain girls will come to major importance as the film comes to a close. Yasuda puts pressure on Mitsuru to get the ransom so that he can pay for drugs. This shows how far Mitsuru has sunk in his life. A key turning point in the film comes when we actually find who this girl really is what happened to the girl Mitsuru and Maki were supposed to have kidnapped and the reasons behind several murders and spooky goingson in the school.The setting and it's selection not to mention the girl's fascination with Matsuru's not leaving are key components in the overall scheme of things in this ghost story. The deaths that occur to certain characters who get what's coming to them is secondary to a surprise ending which gears more towards a sad closing between two people who make peace with themselves. That final fifteen minutes will probably not work for most people because it's quite a mood changer that really creates a bit of an unevenness but overall the film provides some good creepy moments as characters search dark hallways as something hiding in the distance lurks. Overall the film doesn't quite hit the high marks like it wishes and we question who was actually killing all the people in the film.".

I guess you have to see the movie and maybe then you will tell me what's the whole point with the ending... you should watch it... anyway about the title pray i guess the real pray must be the friends of the main character the main character seems bad but in the end you will understand why he behaves like he does.. I also found this comment about the movie This is better than a lot of the very recent straighttovideo horror I've recently reviewed. It is easily superior to Ghost System in both plausibility and impact and comes across as far more mature and developed than even the best of the Kadokawa Horror series in which Mizukawa Asami likewise appears or any similar collection.But this remains squarely in the BGrade tier leaving a bit to be desired in terms of narrative creativity overall dramatic acting and cinematic style. Regarding style this film seems quite dark literally throughout. The stylistic reason for this of course is to juxtapose the brilliantly lit flashbacksupernatural scenes so as to create greater visualemotional impact. But that said you will undoubtedly wonder why the vast majority of this storyline takes place in incredibly underlit settings. In terms of acting I felt Tamayama Tetsuji did a fine job. This was the first time I've seen his work and won't be surprised if he reappears in future films reviewed here within the hallowed halls of SaruDama. The other cast by and large come across as mediocre at best and I myself was about to start haunting Mizukawa Asami due to her over the top hysterics and constant screamwhining. And finally as regards narrative creatively I won't go into detail any further than I already have when I noted that the creativity here involves solely the perhaps unique interweaving of otherwise established themes into an interesting whole.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this film a lot more than I expected to. I was never very taken with Beavis and Butthead's short sketches on MTV and in truth they've never really taken off in England the same way they did in the States. The somewhat obvious satire lacks the gentle wit of Mike Judge's other creation King of the Hill and spending 80 minutes in their company was a dubious prospect.However ...Do America sensibly opens out the scope taking in less broad targets. For a start we have Beavis and Butthead's hippie teacher who gently strums his spiritual song Lesbian Seagull. It's a testament to the profile of the cartoon that Englebert Humperdinck gives his own rendition of this for the end titles. But best of all is their neighbour redneck Tom Anderson Catchphrase I'd love to get my hands on those two bs for whacking off in my camper van who while not the same character has the exact same voice personality and appearance of Hank from Hill. Judge obviously knew when he was on to a good thing and built a series around this great character.The plot is brilliantly silly with the two boys getting involved unwittingly in a plot that sees a killer virus attempted murder and the emergence of World War III.

	onyx:emotionText "I enjoyed this film a lot more than I expected to. I was never very taken with Beavis and Butthead's short sketches on MTV and in truth they've never really taken off in England the same way they did in the States. The somewhat obvious satire lacks the gentle wit of Mike Judge's other creation King of the Hill and spending 80 minutes in their company was a dubious prospect.However ...Do America sensibly opens out the scope taking in less broad targets. For a start we have Beavis and Butthead's hippie teacher who gently strums his spiritual song Lesbian Seagull. It's a testament to the profile of the cartoon that Englebert Humperdinck gives his own rendition of this for the end titles. But best of all is their neighbour redneck Tom Anderson Catchphrase I'd love to get my hands on those two bs for whacking off in my camper van who while not the same character has the exact same voice personality and appearance of Hank from Hill. Judge obviously knew when he was on to a good thing and built a series around this great character.The plot is brilliantly silly with the two boys getting involved unwittingly in a plot that sees a killer virus attempted murder and the emergence of World War III.

	schema:reviewBody "Beavis and Butthead was one of the many points in my childhood where I knew I was unlike anybody else. I was entertained beyond belief by these two dimwits who knew nothing in the world outside of their couch and their television. Seeing this movie young most likely around ten I honestly didn't like it. I found it to be boring and I hated how Beavis and Butthead left the town of Highland and ventured out into the big world.I watched it a year later and went on to like it. This is my third viewing. Now I can fully appreciate it. I understood all the jokes but at the same time I wished the film took place in the town of Highland I realize that the creators and the director respectively had to create a plot that was very large and made to fit an eightyfive minute run time. Not the usual five to ten minute run time the MTV program was used to.At the time this movie was the near conclusion to the MTV program that ran for five years. There was rumored to be a sequel for years and remained in development but never happened. Fine by me. We got something better. It took fifteen years but in 2011 it's said that the show will return to MTV with brand new episodes poking fun at music videos and viral videos. I'm skeptical yet my excitement is through the roof.Beavis and Butthead Do America is about the two adolescents that go in search of their missing television set. Wandering into a motel they become mistaken by a drunk named Muddy Willis as the men he hired to kill his wife. Saying he hired them to do his wife the boys believe they are being payed to have sex with Muddy's wife. The boys don't object but then become labeled the most dangerous men in America by the FBI who are in search of a mysterious chip they call the unit. The humor isn't as racy as people would expect. It maintains a PG13 rating and uses it neutrally. That comes off as one of its flaws sadly. Like the South Park movie that boasted an R rating with very foul language and sex references clearly showed what could be on the big screen differs greatly from Comedy Central. With Beavis and Butthead Do America it does the same thing it would've done if it were a TV movie. Even The Simpson's Movie went a little further than its FOX limits.Still it's worth it for the pleasure of seeing one of the greatest animated duos on the big screen doing what they do best nothing. The best thing about the teens is they get in trouble without even trying to get in trouble. They are a victim of bad timing but somehow avoid every possible consequence. The FBI agent orders roadblocks they are in the middle of the desert. They order the Dream America bus to stop they get on a Nun's bus.My favorite scene is when their peace'd out teacher tries to tell them from the bottom of his heart that having no Television actually opens a window of opportunity. He claims people need to realize that we don't need TV to entertain us. After that very near and dear moment all they pick up is entertain us. Beavis and Butthead Do America has gotten better with repeated viewings but is seems it never was boring. I think being young and dumb the film didn't sit right with me for the reasons I stated above. After the third time it was pretty cool.Starring Mike Judge Demi Moore and Bruce Willis. Directed by Mike Judge.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beavis and Butthead Do America is filled with vulgar humour sadistic or otherwise bizarre characters and a convoluted plot insane enough to make no sense. These are some of the movie's finer qualities. If you didn't like the main duo to begin with then this will do nothing to convince you otherwise. But why should it?Mike Judge has managed to fill out the 75 or so minutes well without making it drag and he's done it with style. Since he cannot change the simplistic constantly sniggering leads he has done the most logical thing he could by surrounding them with a plethora of multifaceted characters tied together with a conspiracy plot that takes them into other locations where their simplebuteffective doubleentendre humour can flourish. Previous characters make a return and are given some development where relevant to the plot.It all starts inauspiciously enough  the hard rock obsessed teenagers awake one day still on their couch to find their beloved television is missing. Not smart enough to put the pieces of the puzzle together to catch the thieves in the act they try and steal one from their school. Wandering around town ever more desperate they somehow manage to usurp the television thieves but not in the way you might expect. This lands them right in the thick of it and the unassuming pair make their way through. Hilarity ensues on a regular basis.In my opinion as a wouldbe critic we need more films like these. Certainly there are plenty of grossout movies some of them also animated as a side note the animation here is a nice balance between the original show and something more polished but there are few that can take simple toilet humour and dress it up so well making it more than just a guilty pleasure to enjoy after a few beers andor a joint. This is right up there with the finer moments of South Park for such an achievement and can easily be considered Beavis and ButtHead's crowning moment of funny andor awesome.Overall this is a fun feelgood comedy which doesn't require all your brainpower to enjoy to the fullest though an extra watch or two might throw up a few sight gags or subplot references that you missed the first time around for whatever reason! The plot seems somehow relevant too considering that it also deals with an issue that has been a headline grabber in post911 society.

	onyx:emotionText "Beavis and Butthead Do America is filled with vulgar humour sadistic or otherwise bizarre characters and a convoluted plot insane enough to make no sense. These are some of the movie's finer qualities. If you didn't like the main duo to begin with then this will do nothing to convince you otherwise. But why should it?Mike Judge has managed to fill out the 75 or so minutes well without making it drag and he's done it with style. Since he cannot change the simplistic constantly sniggering leads he has done the most logical thing he could by surrounding them with a plethora of multifaceted characters tied together with a conspiracy plot that takes them into other locations where their simplebuteffective doubleentendre humour can flourish. Previous characters make a return and are given some development where relevant to the plot.It all starts inauspiciously enough  the hard rock obsessed teenagers awake one day still on their couch to find their beloved television is missing. Not smart enough to put the pieces of the puzzle together to catch the thieves in the act they try and steal one from their school. Wandering around town ever more desperate they somehow manage to usurp the television thieves but not in the way you might expect. This lands them right in the thick of it and the unassuming pair make their way through. Hilarity ensues on a regular basis.In my opinion as a wouldbe critic we need more films like these. Certainly there are plenty of grossout movies some of them also animated as a side note the animation here is a nice balance between the original show and something more polished but there are few that can take simple toilet humour and dress it up so well making it more than just a guilty pleasure to enjoy after a few beers andor a joint. This is right up there with the finer moments of South Park for such an achievement and can easily be considered Beavis and ButtHead's crowning moment of funny andor awesome.Overall this is a fun feelgood comedy which doesn't require all your brainpower to enjoy to the fullest though an extra watch or two might throw up a few sight gags or subplot references that you missed the first time around for whatever reason! The plot seems somehow relevant too considering that it also deals with an issue that has been a headline grabber in post911 society. But not without a couple of sniggers along the way of course.7 stars out of 10 very very good.";

Of course the plot line is going to be pretty farfetched to get Beavis  ButtHead to leave Highland let alone their couch and the humour of Beavis  ButtHead will wear thin for most people after half an hour but I have to say I'm a fan of these guys and the movie is pretty damn entertaining.Still I think the movie lacks some of the 'social commentary' aspects of the TV show. Yes the TV show had lots of toilet humour and Beavis  ButtHead doing stupid things but I actually think the show had more depth to it than most people gave it credit for especially with the stereotypical characters it dealt with. The support cast of the TV show is absent here no Coach Buzzcut no Daria no Stewart no Todd and McVicker my favourite the principal driven to a nervous wreck by Beavis  ButtHead plays only a minimal role. I guess this is something that had to be done to get Beavis  ButtHead out on the road to make it more of a 'cinematic' experience but it is a shame that people watching only the movie will miss out on some of the funny stereotypical characters the show featured.Beavis  ButtHead Do America is definitely not for everyone there is nothing 'offensive' about it but most people will find the humour dumb and repetitive.

I remember when it originally came out that Beavis  ButtHead were pretty played out by this point and a feature length theatrical film filled with big names voicing characters Bruce Willis Demi Moore Robert Stack Cloris Leachman Eric Bogosian Richard Linklater Greg Kinnear David Spade and David Letterman as a Roadie seemed like overkill. I remember grudgingly liking the film but rewatching after having not seen Beavis  ButtHead in quite some time the film felt pretty fresh and surprisingly prescient given the amount of pop culture youth take in today along with the dumbing down society also see Mike Judge's underrated satire Idiocracy for further explorations of these same themes. However it may be that I'm now older and and am just cranky old man bemoaning kids these days. Back in 1996 MTV was the main source of youth pop culture and Beavis  ButtHead were a hilarious sent up of MTV's lowest common denominator fans. Today youth consume pop culture instead through any number of social media apps and streaming appsdevices rather than one channel and Tiger Beat magazine. The medium may have changed but a satire of youth culture being dumbed down to a ridiculously low level of by our two heroes is still just as relevant today. I think it's this element of satire that many critics missed back when Beavis  ButtHead originally aired. Beavis  ButtHead were never presented as characters to to aspire to or intended to be seen as cool. They were made by their creators to be held up for ridicule and to be mocked. Admittedly many youth at the time missed the intended irony and instead enjoyed the TV series for all the wrong reasons but that's not a reason to dismiss the characters outright. Now to this film in particular the pair have their precious television stolen and they then set out to find a replacement which has them mistaken for hitmen and puts them in the middle of government espionage and intrigue of which they are completely oblivious. I found just about everything in the film hilarious and worthy of being considered satire. Everything in the film works as both as straight humor and also as social commentary. From the oblivious Tom Anderson a likely cousin of King of the Hill's Hank Hill to Mr. Van Driessen lovingly sung rendition of Lesbian Seagull over a montage of Beavis  ButtHead obscenities committed across the country on their ill conceived cross country road trip to score to the pair meeting the Bubba US President of the 90s Bill Clinton is all quite funny and quite clever. Overall if you can get past or get into the crass surface level humor Beavis  ButtHead Do America is heeeeeelarious.".

	onyx:emotionText "Beavis  ButtHead Do America is a good movie with a pretty well written storyline and a terrific voice cast. It's nothing outstanding but it's simply a fun and enjoyable ninety minutes of animated adult comedy. I'm not a huge fan of the Beavis  ButtHead television series I like it but don't love it and that's the same way I felt about this I don't have any care or sympathy for these characters but seeing them behave like huge idiots in this movie which is basically just a long episode of the series was certainly a good time. Die hard fans of the television series will certainly love it as for people who have never seen a single episode it is still worth the watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. After their TV is stolen Beavis  ButtHead travel across America in search of it.";

I was in a deep dark depressing time my wife left Metallica released Load and I was on the verge of committing suicide. Then I saw on a movie and I knew my dark days would end. I bought fifteen tickets and I put on my best Metal Health shirt and walked to the theater. I was immediately greeted with the into parodying a 1970s blaxploitation and the greatest intro song since Beetlejuice. Then I saw it's quick wit humor. I cried tears of joy I never cry. Remember the magic carpet ride in the film Alladin? Well imagine feeling that sense of euphoria and godliness throughout a movie Whos runtime is is 120. When I left the film I went and got a haircut got clean clothes fed my pet gerbil and got a job. It turned my life around. It taught me to love myself as well as nature. It taught me to teach young children to swim. If you want to experience true wonder and feel as though you're a child again WATCH THIS GODLIKE FILM.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scoring with chicks obsesses Beavis and Butthead in director Mike Judge's first featurelength animated opus Beavis  Butthead Do America a rude but occasionally clever cartoon farce that ridicules those two trendy booger picking adolescent slackers. Although I've seen my share of their television shenanigans I haven't kept abreast of their obnoxious antics the way some of my friends have so I tagged along with two Beavis and Butthead connoisseurs. My B  B fans felt Beavis  Butthead Do America was the equivalent of a greatest hits album of their clowning around on the tube. Aside from a surprise or two Beavis and Butthead are just as nauseating on the big screen as they are on the small one. They did feel that Do America was a great way to introduce these reptilian lifeforms to silver screen spectators. Beavis  Butthead Do America opens with two amusing sequences. The first spoofs King Kong with giantsized versions of our lamebrained protagonists stomping helterskelter though a miniature city while tanks and helicopters blast away at them. The sketchy animation looks pretty good on the big screen too. In the second sequence Isaac Hayes provides the lyrics to the hilarious title sequence that sends up the old ABCTV undercover law  order series Starsky and Hutch with our characters dresses up as the two heroic cops. Neither sequence has much to do with the other or the story in general but the sequences are fun and the film lurches off to a colorful start with them.The screenplay by Beavis  Butthead creator Mike Judge follows our protagonists across the United States. Thieves have stolen Beavis  Butthead's television set and the kids set out to find them. Instead they meet a thug called Muddy voice of Bruce Willis who promises them a small fortune if they will kill his wife. Of course when our sexstarved idiots agree to do his wife they make the mistake of thinking that Muddy means for them to engage in sexual relations with her. Ironically the two thieves who pinched Beavis  Butthead's TV were supposed to carry out the hit for Muddy.Once this mistakenidentity plot gets underway Federal Agents with the Department of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms appear like storm troopers for justice. They pursue Beavis and Butthead on a crosscountry chase because they believe that the guys are terrorists with a horrible biological bomb. In an inspired bit of voice casting Untouchables star Robert Stack provides the voice for their fascist nemesis. He resolves to capture the guys and he forces anybody whose had contact with them to submit to deep cavity searches. Stack's voice is perfect because he plays the part with such deadpan sobriety. Other cute bits include Butthead's visit to the White House where he hits on Chelsea Clinton. Chelsea dumps him unceremoniously out the window in an act of defenestration. Later the boys visit with President Clinton. He makes them honorary ATF agents. Another funny scene has Beavis and Butthead dismissing the geyser Old Faithful because they call it boring only to be dazzled by urinals in a nearby toilet that flush when a light sensor is activated. Probably the only surprise in the entire comic film is their trek through the desert where they meet two scumbag bikers who turn out to be none other than their fathers. Undeniably just as Beavis and Butthead is an acquired taste so is this very crude comedy. The boys have changed little since their tube days. Beavis picks his nose constantly and repeatedly sings his bunghole song. The boys resemble the Trix rabbit in the cereal commercial because they never get what they want. The only characters from the TV series that drop in for appearances are Mr. Anderson their hippie teacher and their school principal. You won't see Mr. Buzzcut Daria or Stewart.If you enjoyed Beavis  Butthead on MTV Beavis  Butthead Do America should make you chuckle often throughout its brisk 81minute running time. If numbers are anything to go by the 50 million plus that Beavis  Butthead Do America has grossed pun intended! at the box office thus far should guarantee a sequel.".

The effect is rather like watching Norman Wisdom in the same film as Jerry Lewis while each tries to slow down and dilute his schtick to make the other look better. One excruciating routine has one of them repeatedly failing to notice as the other dirties the window he has just cleaned. The rather cute Fos has her features fixed in an expression of contempt throughout though it might be boredom and Riaboukine is wasted in the Alan Rickman role. The hardware and production values are in fact pretty well matched to the Die Hard films even the colour processing is the same but it only makes one long all the more for someone to either shoot or defenestrate these two cretins and put us out of our misery.

	schema:reviewBody "Dis 'Hard' was what the posters for this movie read a clever french play on the American film Die Hard.  La Tour Montparnasse is a blatant spoof of Die Hard by the two incredibly popular French comedians Eric and Ramzy.  I'm not sure there is an American equivalent to these guys but Martin Lawrence comes to mind.  Eric and Ramzy combine to create the mismatched comedy pair one tall the other short one loud the other shy.  Although this pairing has been done over and over and over again Eric and Ramzy are good natured and playful and are enjoyable to watch.The film on the other hand isn't so easy to watch.  La Tour Montparnasse is the sole skyscraper in Paris the natural setting for a French Die Hard knockoff.  The movie starts off with Eric and Ramzy playing window washers on the side of the building.  They are wasting time spitting off the building and trying to flirt with the women inside the building.  Within 3 minutes of this movie you have a rough idea of the intelligence behind it. It is dumb.  It is childish.  It has pretty low production value.  But there are some decent gags.The scenes I thought were quite funny was a matrix spoof yes it's pretty topical humor and an incredible spoof of Bruce Lee's Game of Death.  This joke probably flies by most of the audience I think I was the only one laughing in the theater but it is hilarious.  There is also a decent Speed spoof at the very end of the film.The negatives to the film?  It is pretty dang homophobic.  Apparently in France it is still okay to have homophobia in the films but I found it a little jarring.  There is a constant banter between Eric and Ramzy about gayness.  The production values for the film are also quite low but considering comedies usually aren't huge budget blockbusters anyway it's not such a huge deal.  Maybe the most blatant problem is the film's tendency to act like Scary Movie it comes off as a series of gags with no real connection between them.  The plot is thiiiiiiin and it serves only to bridge the gags or spoofs in the film.Overall I would give the film a middle of the road 5.  It's not great it's not terrible and any Bruce Lee fan should definately watch the great spoof near the last half hour of the film.".

The story of the film is really old I knew the ending half way though the film but the cinematography was excellent. The songs are terrific composed by one of my favourite music composers Pritam. Every song is good and I like the remix version of the song Miss you everyday better than the original. Tusshar  Kareena were the best Ayesha Takia was OK but the other guy who played Ranveer was terrible someone else should have taken his place. I just don't understand one thing that when Tusshar  Ayesha met the first time in Rocky's birthday party Ayesha's hair was flying all over when she was in front of Tusshar how can there be wind indoors? was there a fan in front of her?  if a fan was in front of her then why wasn't Tusshar's hair flying?

Karan hukka has also an important role in this film. This is actually a love triangle. Tusshar has done some degrees in architecture but not practices because his father is rich. But Ayesha likes guys who are self dependent. So despite Tussshar loves Ayesha he could not tell her that. Tusshar gone to become established. But meanwhile Ayesha became engaged with Karan. Tusshar came back but seeing Ayesha engaged he decided not to tell about his love because he wanted to see her happy. The story will end up in a typical bollywood style. This type of story we have actually seen so many times that we can predict the ending very easily. The acting was flat throughout the film. At least the director could have done better to lift the film slightly up. There were some comedy scenes but they were just annoying. The songs are also forgettable except that item song by Kareena.

I am not a Bond fan and I always considered Brosnan a lightweight actor.Much to my surprise Brosnan was dead on in his portrayal of an uncultured heavydrinking but loving father who has his children taken away.  It was obvious that he was very passionate about the role and seemed to be on a mission to prove his mettle as a serious actor.This is a very atypical movie not really fitting into any of the usual predictable genres.  It has its funny moments but it is mostly sobering and heartwrenching.  Aidan Quinn Julianna Margulies formerly of ER and the little girl who plays Evelyn head an impressive supporting cast.Those who require explosions and car chases need not bother with this one but if you enjoy an intelligent touching human drama you will be in for an unexpected treat.".

Much to his naive and broken heart's dismay he later realizes that once the government has them it intends to keep them from living in a paternal one parent home. It tells the story of this man's journey becoming a better man and father. It also tells the story of the incidents behind the over turning of an unconstitutional law which had never been successfully challenged. Played brilliantly by Pierce Brosnan who was born in Ireland with Alan Bates taking on the role of the exbarrister retired who changed the course of Irish family history.

At least it goes after the right things a father having custody of his kids rather than them being forced to live in an institution.The story is based a true situation in the mid 1950s Ireland in which in the end the Irish Constitution was amended because of this case. Desmond Doyle Pierce Brosnan is the loving father whose wife runs off one day with another man leaving him with three little kids and little visible means of support. Since he didn't have enough finances the government makes the kids wards of the state and places them in Catholic schoolshomes institutions?.On that Catholic or religious angle you get a lot of positive and negative scenes here. You have a bad nasty almost sadistic nun Sister Brigid but the others are fine caring ladies as they should be. Overall however you see a lot of faith portrayed in this film and it's mostly good. Of course that faith was more out in the open in the '50s than today but it was inspiring to see in many parts.Brosnan is excellent in the lead role a man everyone can identify with a loving but flawed man. He drinks too much he swears he doesn't have a steady job but he has great heart and has great determination to the right thing. One has no trouble rooting for him in this story. I think it's the best role he has ever played far better than his superficial James Bond or thieves roles he normally plays.But nobody hits you as emotionally as little Evelyn Sophie Vavasseur one of Doyle's three kids and the one that is focused upon here. The two little brothers are not given much screen time for some reason. Brosnan's allies in here  the two lawyers played by Stephen Rea and Aiden Quinn are likable as is Alan Bates who plays a rugged exbarrister who winds up helping the team. Bates might have had the best role for the supporting actors.This is such an involving story one that you really care about the people it can bring a tear or two in the end but what's wrong with that? When you are finished watching this film you feel good.".

Evelyn is the eldest of the three children and has a special bond with her father which is the basis of the whole movie.  Pierce Brosnan plays his character with a delicacy and dedication in which you the viewer completely forget him as Pierce Brosnan and start to really believe that this is a documentary type movie and not a Hollywood production.  As Pierce Brosnan is Irish by birth it is not surprising how well he can pull off a moderate Irish accent but it is still a bit shocking considering how English he usually seems when he is seen onscreen.  Stephen Rea Alan Bates Aidan Quinn and Juliana Margulies round out the rest of the adult cast and all put in performances that are worthy of their talents.  Juliana Margulies being an American born actress is able to portray an Irish woman with accent very convincingly.

He suffers from a prejudice that only mothers can raise kids.I liked this movie because I identified with the father. To my surprise my kids love this movie also. They've watched it about 10 times. This is partly because they've been the victims of a courtordered custody change. But also my daughters find the Evelyn Doyle character inspiring. She is calm and courageous and sensible in the face of a wrong system.";

	schema:headline " An AntiAngela's Ashes?";
	schema:reviewBody "Those of us who endured the gruelling Angela's Ashes a few years back probably came away with the impression that living in 1950s Ireland was like living in hell or maybe slightly worse.  We were treated to the dysfunctional family to end all the father was a mean drunk the mother was nuts the kids were brats their relatives were all vicious or nuts they were poorer than dirt they lived under the heel of a Stalinist Catholic Church and it NEVER STOPPED RAINING.  I left the cinema wondering not why so many Irish had left their country but why any had stayed.Now along comes Evelyn which also is about poor people in 1950s Ireland but this seems to be the Hallmark greeting card version.  The father played by Pierce Brosnan using I imagine his native accent does drink but he's not at all mean about it his kids are angelic and the mother who abandons them only gets about five minutes of screen time and is soon forgotten. There are relatives who may not like one another but are united in their love for the kids an enjoyable scene has Evelyn the daughter running back and forth conveying messages between two of them.  There are a lot of wellmeaning friends and acquaintances.  They live in a nice home and don't seem to be starving or barefoot.  It almost seems no big deal when the mother leaves if anything one supposes what little money they have will go further with one fewer mouth to feed there's an obligatory scene with Brosnan versus a boiling pot because of course all men are morons in the kitchen.So it seems a little odd when government minions step in and announce that nice Mr. Doyle whose wife left him can't keep his kids any more.  Now I know this is based on a true story and I know from other sources there was indeed a vast orphanage gulag complete with slave labor in Ireland partly so that church and state could pretend it's possible to have a functioning country without divorce or abortion and there was always nearby England. Some of that background would have been fascinating in Evelyn but maybe too depressing.   So we just have to accept that here's this quaint country with this goofy law arbitrarily taking people's kids away.  Doyle readily accedes to the removal then abruptly wants them back.  His efforts make up the remainder of the movie.The problem here is what psychologists call cognitive dissonance on the one hand we're constantly reminded that the struggle of Doyle and his supporters against the churchstate hierarchy is hopeless on the other hand there's never really a sensation of hopelessness or desperation. There's a kind of amiable smoothness to the events and frequent humorous moments.  This may be partly due to the guiding hand of director Bruce Beresford who has never met a dramatic situation that he couldn't make cozy whether it was the Boer War in Breaker Morant Southern racial tensions in Driving Miss Daisy capital punishment in Last Dance or Japanese POW camps in Paradise Road the latter also with J. Margulies from ER. The orphanages in which the kids live don't even seem that unpleasant aside from one fascistic nun whose misdeeds get exposed anyway.  The real horror of the Irish orphanage gulag was that it was swept under the rug for decades. This movie functions under a sunshine law literally I don't want to spoil the  big climactic scene for anyone but let's just say that if they ever do another version of Alice in Wonderland spunky little Sophie Vavasseur is just the one to stand up and up and up and tell all the high muckamucks they're all just a pack of cards.I hope this isn't making it seem I didn't enjoy the movie quite the contrary.  I especially liked the ordinaryjoe quality of Brosnan's Doyle neither sinister nor saintly fumbling his way toward becoming a better man for his kids' sake.  If anything I wish they'd given him a few more warts if only to make the point that if a parent is not clearly abusing his or her kids then those kids belong with the parent  and not with the sodding government or church.  Nice to see some of my favorites like Stephen Rea and Aidan Quinn and Alan Bates being such good sports. Julianna M. gets probably her most normal film role yet and shows at least to me why she should be a major star.  She exudes realness.  When male characters contend for her I buy it.  Can't say that about every actress some of whom probably get paid a lot more for their roles sorry Sandra Bullock.Basically this is a feelgood flick and we can always use those.  But like the orphans still behind the walls at the end there is a darker theme still waiting for it's moment in the sun.By the way dogracing's not a very nice thing either.".

The child actors were very convincing although with the habits they were wearing it was hard to tell the good nuns from the bad nuns. The screenplay had just enough humor to keep the movie from getting too sappy which is critical if you want guys to keep from walking out. Much better material for Pierce Brosnan than the James Bond scripts.".

This film really touched me and caught the attention of many more and changed a nation. I liked especially the part when the girl describes the truth of what the sister did to her contrary to what she said about helping her it was cool to rip the mascara off of her!

Pierce who in my mind has been the best Bond in the business excluding Connery who being first gets originality and was good for 2 or three more at least proves again as in 'Grey Owl' he is a first rate actor who shouldn't be judged simply as another 'Bond action man'. He acts his heart out in this role and brings the viewer a lovely story that probably wouldn't have been told without his personal support. More please Pierce if the Bond producers can't recognise talent and the public great judgement more 'Evelyn' type stories please Pierce and the Oscar should be just around the corner.

Known for his television work in Remington Steele and for his movie appearances as James Bond he's come to symbolize suave sophistication and any woman's ultimate romantic icon.With this movie Brosnan attempts to go against type. He succeeds to a degree because for the entire movie all one can see is Brosnan with an Irish accent playing a sweet hard working Irishman who has that Irish temper that flares in one inopportune but justifiable moment and will come to bite him later on via a cartoon vengeful nun. Note the mention of the word Irish it's for a reason. I felt as though I was being hammered with it it's as if the movie wanted to make sure I knew just where EVELYN was taking place.EVELYN has another big problem. Several siblings get separated after they are taken away from Brosnan's Desmond Doyle but the story chooses for inexplicable reasons to focus on the Dickensian experiences of the daughter  who grants the movie its title  who meets the aforementioned cartoon nasty nun who seems all too eager to enforce her discipline.Also even at its 90 minutes it seems just a tad long and a shade too manipulative for me to really feel the story. A moment when young Sophie Vavausseur as Evelyn has to testify her case against the prosecution does feel real and has a quiet mysticism about it. Other than that much of what happens in the movie has a perfunctory element to it. The inclusion of actors Aidan Quinn Stephen Rea Alan Bates and Julianna Margulies brings little relevance.

I could only think of him saying I'm BondJames Bond and now he comes with this Irish accent with doesn't suit him right and he is Irish! but we forgive him. In fact we forgive lots of things in movies like this. Brosnan ends up achieving a moving and dedicated performance making us forget about his old spy roles. He plays Desmond Doyle a father abandoned by his wife that has to leave their children to authorities due to a lack of money. Then with strength and courage plus the help of some they arrive to a trialThis is based in a true story.These characters the ones I like to call helpers because they stay with the hero from the start until the end. They also carry on with specific plot obligations. Alan Bates plays the old fox Tom Connolly who wants to take his glory days back and he puts a lot of enthusiasm to the movie. Brian McGrath's Hugh Canning Connolly's friend and newsman who informs the results of the trials in the most cheerful way. Nick Barron the lawyer who was first against but then helped more than any other played by Aidan Quinn with an elegant smile and charm. Stephen Rea shows to be in top form with his honest but shy lawyer Michael Beattie. And his sister Bernadette Beattie puts some love again in Desmond's life and is played by Julianna Margulies with innocence and wisdom. It is a wonderful showcase of performances director Bruce Beresford seems to know them all and when everybody looks comfortable Still from all these characters the one who highlights the most is Evelyn Sophie Vavasseur one of Desmond's children. I can clearly see the plot's interest in her because of thefilm's title but even when the bond between her and her father is strong she shouldn't have been the plot's center because it obligates us to give an importance to her that she doesn't probably have. There other two sons I won't even mention their names because they don't even seem to be there and Desmond's father Henry a marvelous Frank Kelly but we mostly see Evelyn in church with the nuns and no other relevant subplot whatsoever. However young actress Vavasseur is a revelation and shows gifts of an immense talent and that's a positive thing for pieces of this type.We get the usual including a script by Paul Pender full of phrases as I said directed to the heart that unite to that touching music and that captivating image in this movie where everything is correct but it ultimately depends of usIf we let it in or not.".

However young actress Vavasseur is a revelation and shows gifts of an immense talent and that's a positive thing for pieces of this type.We get the usual including a script by Paul Pender full of phrases as I said directed to the heart that unite to that touching music and that captivating image in this movie where everything is correct but it ultimately depends of usIf we let it in or not.";

Nonetheless he holds his head up high and has a real pally attitude. Frank Kelly Father Jack from Father Ted plays a kind hearted grandfather well. In the best character ranks is also Sophie Vavasseur as Evelyn who steals the show shes a brave and defiant cookie in the institution and the court.It's also good in nature with Brosnan's family sticking together along with the support he receives from Frank Kelly Julianna Margulies the lawyers and pub patrons. It's also good natured with the concept of the sun through the clouds being Frank Kelly looking down from heaven.It's also good as an expose of over the top and out dated morals being injected into government generally speaking. Even though Brosnan was dumped by a wife who clearly wasn't interested in staying he genuinely made an effort to care for the children. But the law ruined everything.But politics aside it's a simple pleasant story involving strong sympathetic characters played by a good cast.

	schema:headline " Film is simply told and quite effective";
	schema:reviewBody "While on the surface this appears to be a story that lacks originality but it truthfully tells a true story that ended up challenging Irish laws. Story takes place in Ireland circa 1953 where an unemployed carpenter finds out that his wife has left him for another man and he has to take care of his three kids. Desmond Doyle Pierce Brosnan is not only unemployed but a hard drinker and when he is forced to face the courts he has no choice but to surrender his kids where they are placed in orphanages and in the care of nuns. Desmond is led to believe that if he gets a job and cleans up his act he can get them back but the Irish laws state that a single parent cannot raise children by themselves unless the other spouse is dead or signs an agreement. SPOILER ALERTDesmond talks to a lawyer named Michael Beattie Stephen Rea who tells him that it's useless but his Irish American friend Nick Barron Aidan Quinn decides to take the case and both he and Desmond are interested in the same bar maid Bernadette Julianna Margulies. After they lose their first trial they decide to go all the way to the Supreme Court to challenge the law and they enlist in the help of a legendary retired lawyer named Tom Connolly Alan Bates who guides them through all the phases.This film is directed by the talented Bruce Beresford who is always good at making films about characters beating the odds or at least trying to survive them. The story is simple but it is based on fact and if certain events and characters seem a tad obvious it's suppose to because the film wants to point out that the ridiculous Irish laws are based on something even more ridiculous...religion. Events such as what takes place in this film were common place during those times and that's why the trial that takes place is so important as it led to many families being reunited. Brosnan is solid here with his performance and his usual suaveness and intelligence are put to the side as he portrays Desmond realistically as a slob and a hotheaded drunk who must change his life if he wants to get his children back. It reminds viewers that he can play other roles and he does it extremely well with this effort. The simplicity of the story enhances the drama that's played out on screen and the strength of the film comes not only from it's performances but from it's deep rooted honesty.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oscar Wilde was one of the great wits of his age but he was allegedly not averse to appropriating other people's bons mots. It is said that after his friend and rival James Whistler had made a particularly apposite remark Wilde sighed and said I wish I had said that!. Whistler's reply was You will Oscar you will. The American film industry has a similar attitude to other people's films to the one that Wilde had to other people's conversation. When the European particularly the British or French film industry comes up with a particularly admired film Hollywood gives a collective sigh and says We wish we had made that! You will Hollywood you will!Recent years have seen a glut of remakes of European films but admittedly the results of this creative plagiarism are by no means always bad. The plot of Sommersby may have been blatantly lifted from Le Retour de Martin Guerre but it is still a good film in its own right. Moreover I was one of those who thought that Luc Besson's Nikita did not lose much in translation when it was remade as the Bridget Fonda vehicle The Assassin. Sometimes however Hollywood manages to come up with a remake that is so inferior to its original model that the two films do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. Diabolique is a case in point.HenriGeorges Clouzot's Les Diaboliques was one of the classic thrillers of the fifties as good as the best of Hitchcock's work. Jeremiah Chechik's remake borrows the same basic plot of the original but transfers it from 1950s France to 1990s America. At the centre is the sadistic headmaster of a private school a man who brutally mistreats not only the boys in his care but also his wife and even his beautiful mistress. The wife and mistresstired of his mistreatment plot together to murder him and to dispose of his body in the filthy school swimming pool but when the pool is later drained the body has disappeared. As in the original there is a sudden surprise twist at the end. Chechik also howeverintroduces elements that were not in Clouzot's film. The wife Mia here becomes a former nun who has renounced her vows after losing her faith but is still haunted by guilt. There is a suggestion of a lesbian relationship between Mia and the mistress Nicole. Chechik also introduces a major character in the form of a female detective with no equivalent in the original film.Diabolique has come in for some sharp criticism largely because it is a remake of a classic. It is a mediocre film rather than a horrendously bad one and if we did not have its famous predecessor to compare it with it would doubtless be seen as just another banal and unsuccessful crime thriller. Nevertheless I think that the criticism it has attracted is justified. Chechik must have known that one of the perils of remaking a film is that your work will be weighed in the balance against the original and woe betide you if it is found wanting. And compared with Clouzot's Chechik's film is wanting indeed. He lacks the French director's sense of pacing and ability to convey suspense with the result that his film is slowmoving where the original was brisk and flabby where the original was taut.I was also disappointed by the acting. Isabelle Adjani can be a fine actress in her own language as she showed in La Reine Margot but I have not been impressed with her in Englishlanguage films and here her character never came to life. Sharon Stone was slightly better as the hardbitten sluttish Nicole but this was not really one of her better performances and did nothing to alter my view that she has not always chosen the best vehicles in which to show off her talents. Chazz Palminteri's headmaster was almost too unpleasant to be believable and Kathy Bates seemed wasted as the detective. Watching Clouzot's film I was glued to the screen with anticipation as I wondered how the film would end watching Chechik's my attention was rather glued to my watch as I wondered when it would end. 410".

	schema:headline " Lackluster remake";
	schema:reviewBody "The classic French thriller Diabolique has a sturdy story which is one reason why it is a target for remakes. The film was remade for American television twice  first as Reflections of Murder featuring Tuesday Weld Joan Hackett and Sam Waterston and later as House of Secrets with Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner. To be honest both of those remakes are certainly interesting to watch if lacking in the suspense and novelty of the original. Reflections is fairly faithful to its parent while House of Secrets maintains the bare bones of the storyline and throws in a different setting and some elements of voodoo. If you have not seen the original the enjoyment level of both those films will be elevated.The same cannot be said for the first dunderheaded attempt to cinematically remake the French classic for American audiences. Keeping the original name story and setting would seem a step in the right direction but the film fails due to some incredibly foolish choices.The action takes place at a private boys prep school overseen by the hateful Chazz Palminteri. In between stealing funds from the school Palminteri enjoys subjecting wife Isabelle Adjani  who suffers from a weak heart  to assorted cruelties. In his spare time he engages in SM with ice queen blond teacher Sharon Stone. The two women  tired of his abuse  decide to murder him drop his body in the disgustingly filthy school pool and make it appear that he drowned in a drunken accident. Naturally nothing goes according to plan.The best thing about this film is probably the casting of Sharon Stone in the role made famous by French actress Simone Signoret. If anyone embodies some of the same cunning and sensuality of Signoret from the original in a modern actress it would be Stone. Unfortunately the screenplay and everything around her fails to support her in any way.The changes made to the screenplay are not improvements. While a remake need not be slavishly faithful to the original it should not completely go off the beaten path the way that this film does particularly in its finale. The shock twist ending of the original may no longer be fresh but the shaggy dog pseudofeminist tilt tacked on to this latest effort seems to come completely from left field and is a blatant misfire.If Stone was an inspired choice the remainder of the cast is less so. Isabelle Adjani looking puffy and listless is completely underwhelming as the abused wife. At no point does she engage our sympathy and she often seems entirely too lacking in energy to be remotely terrified. This may well be the most laidback frightened performance one has ever seen on celluloid.Kathy Bates shows up as a detective investigating Palmineri's disappearance and driving the women to distraction. Her performance is immensely enjoyable and she seems to be having a good time. As a cancer survivor she gets to crack completely inappropriate jokes and attempts to lay the groundwork for the we're all sisters under the skin meme that creeps into the film's finale. Unfortunately her character and performance belongs in a completely different and one would argue better film.And the casting of Chazz Palminteri as the abusive schoolmaster is a disaster. Palminteri providing the same performance here as he does in his guise of the reliable Mafia hit man roles in which he specializes is laughably miscast. As tough as he comes off Adjani could arguably physically match him and Stone could step on him without blinking twice. Not only that but we have to believe that there was something that attracted these two attractive women to him and kept them in his orbit when they could easily have moved on. Palminteri resembling a large trout and playing a man with the charisma of a barracuda seems an impossible prospect for these women. We have to believe that one lovely woman would fall for him much less two and no gigantic leap of faith can make this happen.Director Jeremiah Chechik has absolutely no idea how to maintain suspense or an atmosphere of foreboding. The scene shifts are klutzy and obvious. The pacing is often laborious which allows the viewer time to mull over the complexities of the plots and doublecrosses played out before us and realize how absurd the entire scenario truly is  something that the original as well as its TV remakes never allowed the viewer time to contemplate. This material needs a skilled hand but what is provided is a clumsy sledgehammer.The original is noted especially for its shock ending. This remake seems initially to be going for the same thing and then suddenly backtracks  with remorseless characters suddenly developing consciences and people conducting themselves in ways not previously indicated in their respective behavior. By the time all of the leads end up in a watery fight one realizes what a foolish level to which the film has sunk. One is sternly advised to locate either the original French classic or one of its TV counterparts before descending to this entry.".

	schema:reviewBody "With some of Hollywood's worst trash on his resume Director Jeremiah Chechik gives us something slightly better than his worst The Avengers and much worse than his best Benny and Joon.This oddly unsatisfying 1996 remake of the classic 1955 French thriller illustrates Hollywood's ham handed ability to turn a classic suspense tale into a weak atmosphere piece. I say oddly because Isabelle Adjani and Sharon Stone are together on the screen for almost the entire film and the two actresses truly bring out the best in each other. So you have a long series of wellplayed scenes by fine actresses but they are strung together into a slow paced story line that lacks unity and consistent motivation. Which could be caused by a lot of things but is most likely the result of trimming in postproduction in which important unifying elements were left on the cutting room floor. Or it could be that the director and production designer just failed to translate the writer's vision onto the screen.Since this ultimately this is a story about an evil character who develops a sentimental side it is absolutely critical that this process is communicated to the audience. The audience should not just be surprised by the ending but should be able to think back and see all the motivational pieces click into place. In this regard the movie is a complete failure.Then there is the issue of cheating. Because we only know what he wants to tell us a director has a variety of legit ways to introduce misdirection and surprise into a film. But occasionally a director lacks the integrity and vision to play by the rules. Such is the case here as only the audience sees the underwater shot of a clearly drowned Guy Chazz Palminteri. It is shown to convince us that he is dead but this then makes his reanimation impossible. Plus it is fairly useless because you know that he has to come back for there to be much of a story. That is cheating and there is more cheating in the unintentionally comical climatic scene. The beauty of the original movie was the absence of cheating and the macabre irony of the ending. All that is missing.Whatever it means that the only reason to watch this version of Diabolique is for the acting of Adjani and Stone. Although Adjani was 4041 years old when she made this film she has lost little of her beauty. While she was probably the world's most beautiful actress in her twenties there is simply no debate that she was the most beautiful 40 yearold in cinema history. Stone pretty much plays her hardasnails self but she is given some great lines and her character is a great contrast to the ethereal take Adjani gives to her own character.If you are looking for a better but less obvious remake of the original Diabolique track down 1971's Let's Scare Jessica To Death. This almost forgotten horror classic is truly scary. It has much better production design than 1996's Diabolique with creepy whispering and images that stay with you and creep you out even weeks later. Jessica is a woman recently released from a mental institution who goes to a farm in a quiet rural area. The odd locals and their local legends begin to mess with Jessica's head as her husband and his secret girlfriend attempt to scare her to death.".

The frustrating thing about the movie was that it was JUST GOOD ENOUGH and kept JUST ENOUGH of the elements of the original plot to make me hope that things would improve somehow. So I kept watching it. But it never did.I am not Sharon Stone's biggest fan but I acknowledge that she gave a compelling performance in Casino and that very few actresses past or present could have played her role better. Joan Crawford or Betty Davis maybe. And she's a black hole of bitterness and anger here somehow sexually inviting and repellent at the same time. That doesn't make for comfortable viewing. There's the same problem with the lesbian undercurrents between the wife and the mistress  it ought to be titillating or erotic but it's just stale and nasty. And Chazz Palmintieri is a great character actor see 'The Usual Suspects' or Bullets Over Broadway but the character he plays is such a flatout sonofabitch that you really don't want to watch him.But the real the problem with the film is that they were going for dread and suspense but the pacing and rhythms of each of the individual scenes was way off  empty and interminable. So the viewer wound up feeling dread and BOREDOM instead. That doesn't make for 'recommended film viewing'.I still hope to seek out the original one of these days so at least the remake didn't spoil anything. And some one else might like this version just fine on its own merits depending on how big a Stone fan they are it is really her movie  her character drives the events in the plot.".

Mia  a teacher named Nicole Horner Sharon Stone whom is one of Guy's many lovers devise a plan to kill him  make it look like an accident the plan is to drown him  then throw him in the school pool where he will be found  to the police his death will seem like a simple drowning. However after a few days the body isn't found so Mia orders the dirty pool drained when Nicole 'accidently' drops her keys into it once drained Guy's body is not there. Was Guy dead? Did someone find out there plan? Who knows...Directed by Jeremiah Chechik this is a remake of the black and white French film Les Diaboliques 1955 which itself was based on the novel 'Celle Qui N'Etait Plus' by Pierre Boileau  Thomas Narcejac  I thought was a fairly lazy  plodding mystery thriller with truly one of the worst twist endings ever. The humourless  slow moving script by Don Ross takes ages to do what the average episode of Columbo took about 10 minutes to to show someone committing the socalled perfect murder. Then it switches to creepy thriller mode as the body vanishes from where the murderers left it  seemingly has come back to life before it all falls apart with one of the worst most predictable  frankly unlikable twist endings ever. I can't continue my review any further without massive spoilers which will give away the ending so beware anyway I hate the fact that Mia  Nicole suddenly turn into the heroes of the piece when they were just as bad as Guy since in the case of Mia she planned to kill him in cold blood  Nicole was prepared to trick Mia  ultimately kill her if the plan had succeeded. They were really unlikable character's to begin with so this horrible ending where they become the heroes by killing Guy which is basically exactly the same thing which they set out to do in the first place just grated my nerves. Also if Mia was feeling so guilty why did she seem almost redeemed at the end? She still ended up killing Guy anyway so why the miraculous change of heart? Also what about Nicole? She still was part of some scheme where someone was always going to die be it either Mia or Guy. The ending is just so misjudged it makes no sense with the rest of the context of the film it's horribly acted  it's utterly predictable. In fact I guessed how this would end within 30 minutes  I was absolutely right in just about every detail. A really horrible film with an even worse ending one to avoid.Director Chechik has made some really really awful films  after this mess  his subsequent big screen adaptation of The Avengers 1998 which is considered one of the worst films ever made Hollywood thankfully hasn't let him anywhere near a film camera since. This guy should be directing traffic rather than films. This is blandly shot in dull autumnal colours which give it forgettable look. I also have to mention the acting especially by the two female leads Stone  Adjani who are simply terrible. I hated their character's I hated their acting  thought they were two of the worst performances by leading actors in a Hollywood flick I've ever seen. In the UK this is rated '18' meaning noone under that age can watch it I have no idea why as there's no violence worth mentioning no nudity or sex  it's devoid of any action or excitement.Technically the film is alright but it's flat dull  blandly filmed. There's no real style here  it's not a film I will remember in any way apart from that terrible ending. As I've said I think the acting by the two leads is simply awful.Diaboliques is a slow moving utterly predictable thriller with a horrible ending that didn't do anything for me. One to avoid. This probably would have worked better as a 30 minute Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode or maybe even as an obscure black and white French film from the 50's...".

They were really unlikable character's to begin with so this horrible ending where they become the heroes by killing Guy which is basically exactly the same thing which they set out to do in the first place just grated my nerves. Also if Mia was feeling so guilty why did she seem almost redeemed at the end? She still ended up killing Guy anyway so why the miraculous change of heart? Also what about Nicole? She still was part of some scheme where someone was always going to die be it either Mia or Guy. The ending is just so misjudged it makes no sense with the rest of the context of the film it's horribly acted  it's utterly predictable. In fact I guessed how this would end within 30 minutes  I was absolutely right in just about every detail. A really horrible film with an even worse ending one to avoid.Director Chechik has made some really really awful films  after this mess  his subsequent big screen adaptation of The Avengers 1998 which is considered one of the worst films ever made Hollywood thankfully hasn't let him anywhere near a film camera since. This guy should be directing traffic rather than films. This is blandly shot in dull autumnal colours which give it forgettable look. I also have to mention the acting especially by the two female leads Stone  Adjani who are simply terrible. I hated their character's I hated their acting  thought they were two of the worst performances by leading actors in a Hollywood flick I've ever seen. In the UK this is rated '18' meaning noone under that age can watch it I have no idea why as there's no violence worth mentioning no nudity or sex  it's devoid of any action or excitement.Technically the film is alright but it's flat dull  blandly filmed. There's no real style here  it's not a film I will remember in any way apart from that terrible ending. As I've said I think the acting by the two leads is simply awful.Diaboliques is a slow moving utterly predictable thriller with a horrible ending that didn't do anything for me. One to avoid. This probably would have worked better as a 30 minute Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode or maybe even as an obscure black and white French film from the 50's...";

	schema:headline " Two beautiful women in a misguided remake of a great French classic";
	schema:reviewBody "I heard some really bad things about this remake of the classic French film 'Les Diaboliques' and I would never have expected it to be a patch on the brilliant original anyway the only reason I even bothered to watch it is because it happened to be on TV and there happened to be nothing else on. However after the first half hour or so while the film indeed is nothing on the original it seemed like it was going to end up being a decent thriller. But then the problems start the parts where the original's character reflected on what they'd done were the best parts of the film here they're extremely boring and that's where the film falls down. The plot is basically the same as the original and focuses on a school which is ran by a man with a wife and a mistress neither of which like him. They decide that killing him would be a great idea and promptly do it. However after disposing of the body in the school swimming pool and later having it emptied the body isn't there! And what's worse is that the women start to find clues that he may still be alive...It's a real shame that this film wasn't better as the two female leads are excellent. I'm not sure that I would have made it all the way to the end if it wasn't for the fact that I had the beautiful Isabelle Adjani to admire. It's not her greatest performance and she seems to be on autopilot but she fits into the scared mousy role well. She is joined by Sharon Stone who is brilliantly cast as Adjani's colder and more collected opposite number. Stone also looks good which is certainly a bonus considering the shortcomings of the rest of the film. The problem with the second half of the film is really that it's not interesting and there aren't enough other things going on to make up for it. There's a hint of a lesbian relationship between the two leads though nothing really comes of it definitely a big mistake considering how great they both look! Having already seen the original the ending came as no surprise but I'm certain that I could have guessed anyway as there soon becomes only one way that it can go. Overall I could probably watch Isabelle Adjani all day long but not when the film in question is this one. There's not much point bothering with this...see the original instead.".

Just the thought conjures up visions of a vampish Mary Kay Letoureau although director Jeremiah Chechik studiously avoids that angle. Her partner in crime is French actress Isabelle Adjani who plays Mia Baran an exnun who is the owner of the school unhappily married to after being seduced by it appears the school's sadistic task master Guy Baran played with a steady macho malevolence by Chazz Palminteri. Adjani whom I recall vividly from Truffaut's L'Histoire d'Adele H. 1975 in which she played Victor Hugo's daughter Adele who was obsessively in love with an English army lieutenant who didn't want her. The masochistic persona employed there is revisited here as Mia is used by both her husband and Nicole Horner who is also Guy's mistress.Coming lately onto the scene is Kathy Bates as a mandespising middleaged slightly butch Nancy Drew who doesn't let a partial mastectomy slow her down as she sleuths about looking for clues. She has some fine oneliners but perhaps the best in the film comes from Sharon Stone. Two of the school's middleaged bores have just come upon Stone and Adjani in the courtyard. Stone's everpresent cigarette inspires this from one of the men Don't you know that secondhand smoke kills? Sharon Stone maneuvers past him blows smoke in his face and replies Not reliably.This is a remake of Les Diaboliques 1955 starring Simone Signoret which I have not seen. My guess is that the French version played it straight and made the ending at least plausible. Here we have not only a ridiculous ending but a plot in dire need of a plot doctor. I have also not seen the TV version Reflections of Murder starring that quintessential sexkitten and personal favorite Tuesday Weld. Anybody got a copy?Bottom line see this for Isabelle Adjani whose over the top performance is garnished with an au naturale glimpse and for Sharon Stone who is at her diabolical best. Be aware however that if sexual exploitation of the male libido is not your cup of tea you will not like this movie and even if it is you may find the story more than a bit silly.".

I have also not seen the TV version Reflections of Murder starring that quintessential sexkitten and personal favorite Tuesday Weld. Anybody got a copy?Bottom line see this for Isabelle Adjani whose over the top performance is garnished with an au naturale glimpse and for Sharon Stone who is at her diabolical best. Be aware however that if sexual exploitation of the male libido is not your cup of tea you will not like this movie and even if it is you may find the story more than a bit silly.";

Kathy Bates pops out of nowhere to accomplish nothing except adding 30 more minutes onto this pseudothriller borefest.  As the movie went on I found myself concerned less and less with the gratuitous sex and notsointricate plot twists that I seriously considered going out to the lobby to play Space Invaders.".

But the movie is shot gorgeously the score is sumptuous and oddly touching and the movie is often hilariously campy.  Some lame stabs are taken at making the material more relevant and serious Kathy Bates character is a cancer survivor lesbian overtones are rampant but these just make it more absurd.  Even if you haven't seen the original you'll figure out the surprise ending a mile away.  And a thriller could not possibly be plotted more carelessly.  But you've got to give points to a movie that dares to make Sharon Stone a math teacher at an allboys school no less!.  Watch and marvel at how Stone gleefully tramples over doormat Isabella Adjani in every scene as if she's a dragqueen version of herself.  Many will find this movie boring but if you go in expecting a campy silly good time you won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mia is the sickly wife of Guy together they run an exclusive boarding school.  However it is public knowledge that Guy is also sleeping with maths teacher Nicole.  Tired of both being physically and emotionally abused Nicole and Mia decide to murder Guy and drown him in a bathtub before dumping his body in the school pool.  However the body goes missing and it appears that someone is pretending that Guy is still alive.  Meanwhile a private investigator begins to suspect something is amiss.With a solid cast I had reasonable hopes for this film.  It all looks classy enough with good direction however the plot is a pretty basic thriller plot that will remind many viewers of something else that they have seen.  The film has several twists that will be apparent before they happen and it does sadly lack thrills and tension for much of the film.The cast try hard but are hampered by a plot that works nicely on a storyboard but doesn't really engage onscreen.  The characters are also a bit too flat and never really give the actors a chance to show off.  Stone is stuck in another tough vamp role that she just goes with without putting bones onto it.  Adjani is a good actress but she can't really deliver here likewise Palminteri is simply mugging it as a monstrous wife beater. Bates is given a very small role why she has to be a survivor from breast cancer is beyond me  it just seems to be mentioned a lot for no clear reason. The relationships between the characters are not really worked out they are as thin as the characters are.  Particularly Mia and Nicole's relationship could have been stronger instead it is very middle of the road and didn't interest me  despite some lesbian teasing from Stone.Although it all looks good and has a strong list of names in the cast the film fails to really inspire.  I wasn't really engaged that much part of the mystery kept me interested but I felt that the twists and final payoff weren't really that surprising.  Worth seeing but really not very different.".
