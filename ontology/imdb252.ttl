And I'll admit another reason I liked it was the lead character had the same name as me. To find a Ryan in any film is a rarity but also one where the hero is such an outcast was fun. The ending gets a bit outlandish and doesn't really resolve anything but it seemed to the filmmakers point anyway. I mean what else can you make of a story about a geeky 17yearold who may be the halfhuman halfextraterrestrial leader of a clan of weirdos from the planet B52? Exactly.".

I mean that in a good way because the film itself is well crafted and the characterizations of the supporting cast puts a smile on this viewer's face.The intro was particularly interesting and helps draw you into the characters and their world.  Unfortunately this aspect of the film is not carried on throughout leaving the viewer to wonder exactly what happened. Even so the intro does a good job setting the overall tone for the film an offbeat teenage outcast come of age type of movie.Two highlights of this film are Adam West and Andrea Thompson.  Adam West does a bang up job of portraying a well meaning neoUFOconspiracytheorist whose sole aim is to bring about certain events he as thinks they should unfold.  He thinks he knows it all because the things he's seen to him seem to be falling into place for a really big event that'll solve all his and his follower's problems.  Andrea Thompson plays the local bad girl who comforts our protagonist Ryan Richmond and plays her part almost too well by this I mean that when I saw her performance to me it seemed as if the producer's were trying to cut down on costs because the character she portrayed seemed so vaccuous at times and I thought that was because of the actress.  I was wrong.  I've seen Andrea Thompson in other stuff and now know that her performance in this film was just a notch or two above everyone else as she gave us the lonerchick in a leather coat.  If she had played the character a little more light hearted the film might've benefittted some.The underlying theme of the story is the outcast phenomena that occurs with many teens and the pitfalls they face when confronted with people who seemingly understand them but only on a very superfical level and the disastrous consequences of such interactions when their true aims are made manifest.  It's a good morality play for adolescents but even so the film lacks energy at points and suffers some because of it.There're a few laughs here and there and if you're a film fan who likes interesting characters and quirky films then this may prove to be a bonafide masterpiece for your collection.  Otherwise even though I enjoyed it I wouldn't recommend it to everyone as the mixture of offbeat comedy with teen angst strives for a goal that's a bit too ambitious for another otherwise fairly good film.  Overall the comedy rides a low sine wave some of the laughs are good others not as much.".

The scene as shot had paramedics hauling injured patrons out the front door of the hotel to a waiting ambulance. Hugh O'Brian's character came over to me a uniformed cop and asked for a ride downtown. We jumped in my police car and took off. The aliens ran to an old bus and took off but for some reason the front axle of the bus broke just as they were filming and had to be manually pulled back in place. It was a fun gig and all the actors were friendly and going along with it. Almost all of that scene got cut except for a panning shot that shows me with my back to the camera looking up and talking on a handheld radio. !".

A light play around a 'dramcar' and of course love where the rich carsalon owner fells love with a poor but attractive young girl. To reach her hands he makes as if she had won the car as a prize and to get close to her he offers his service as a chauffeur with sharing the income to prove that he's poor too. At the end of course everything turns out and we get the casual happy end. Sadly the best piece of action the wonderful way of Gyula Kabos's speeches and dialogues is only meaningful for Hungarian viewers.".

Well he should think twice before telling silly things. Indeed Max et Jrmie 1992 is his best movie since Greystoke 1984. And this terrific movie is perfectly mastered by Claire Devers. This woman's got plenty of nerve to film violence and blood.As it was the case with another French movie the little criminal 1990 dialogs constitute the vividness of the movie. They contain a lot of humor that enables to keep the spectator in suspense. It also enables to reduce the seriousness of the dramatic side of the story. But especially Claire Devers emphasized on the dialogs for a better focus on the relationships between the two men on one hand Jrmie Christophe Lambert a lost young man who wishes to gain Philippe Noiret's friendship and on the other hand Max Philippe Noiret an elderly man who'll gradually become attached to Max. Little by little a a bit confused but strong friendship will link the two men. Obviously this friendship will have its ups and downs.Apart from this the action sequences aren't neglected for all that and they turn out to be thrilling. At the end the whole gives a stable movie and remarkably well constructed. In spite of a few weaknesses Claire Devers dressed a caricatured portrait of JeanPierre Marielle's assistant and the last twenty minutes tend to run out of steam it's useless to be fussy for this brilliant success. This is arguably one of the best French detective movies of the nineties. At last one thing I don't understand how can such a good movie have a rather low mark on IMDB? It's not fair it deserves much more recognition.".

It follows King David who as a child had slain the giant Goliath and now we find him in adulthood as the second King of Israel. A tough and assured King David however has affairs of the heart causing great problems. For once he spies Bathsheba taking a shower rebath it 's the start of a journey encompassing adultery and betrayal a journey that will end in the judgement of God being called upon.Typically for the genre David  Bathsheba is a large grandiose production. From its excellent set designs to it's positively gorgeous Technicolor photography Leon Shamroy it has enough quality to warrant sitting along side the best the genre has to offer as regards production values. Untypically tho the film is sedately paced and relies on 99 of its worth being driven purely by dialogue. This is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some swash to go with their buckle. This is a very humanist picture in fact lets not beat around the burning bush here it's a Biblical love story flecked with sins of the heart. But that is no bad thing at all because breaking it down we find it's very well acted Peck has a stoic yet vulnerable thing going on real well  Hayward is pushing it to the max and it be a fine story directed with knowing skill by the often forgotten Henry King. And although some of the dialogue is admittedly cringe inducing the character flow is never interrupted as Phillip Dunne's The Ghost and Mrs. Muir Oscar nominated screenplay holds the attention throughout.Sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of the BiblicalSwords  Sandals genres most likely because it is a talky piece that has heart as its main selling point but really it's well worth the time of anyone interested in the most lavish of genres. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always believed that David and Bathsheba was a film originally intended for Tyrone Power at 20th Century Fox although Gregory Peck does give a good account of himself as King David the monarch with a wandering eye.A whole lot of biblical subjects get covered in this film adultery redemption sin punishment and generally what God expects from his followers.When you're a king even king in a biblically prophesied kingdom you certainly do have a lot of prerogatives not open to the rest of us. King David has many wives including one really vicious one in Jayne Meadows who was the daughter of Saul David's predecessor. But his eyes catch sight of Bathsheba out in her garden one evening. Turns out she's as unhappily married to Uriah the Hittite as David is to quite a few women. Uriah is one of David's army captains. David sends for Bathsheba and him being the King she comes a runnin' because she's had her eye on him too.What happens an affair a pregnancy and a carefully arranged death for Uriah in a battle. But an all seeing and knowing Deity has caught all of this and is not only punishing David and Bathsheba but the entire Kingdom of Israel is being punished with drought disease and pestilence.The sexist law of the day calls for Bathsheba to have a stoning death. David shows weakness in his previous actions but here he steps up to the plate and asks that the whole thing be put on him. He even lays hands on the Ark of the Covenant which was an instant death as seen in the film.My interpretation of it is that God admires guts even if you're wrong and he lets up on David and forgives them both. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon and she and David are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah until they're both conquered.Susan Hayward is a fetching Bathsheba caught in a loveless marriage with Uriah played by Kieron Moore. The only thing that gets Moore aroused is a good battle. I liked Kieron Moore's performance as a brave and rather stupid horse's rear. No one can lay the law down like Raymond Massey. His Nathan the Prophet is in keeping with the John Brown character he played in two films same intensity. So when His own law called for death why did God spare Bathsheba and keep David on the throne. Maybe it was the fact He just didn't want to train a third guy for the job. He'd replaced Saul with David already. But I think the Christian interpretation might be that this was a hint of the New Testament forthcoming that one might sin and receive mercy if one asks for it penitently. I'll leave it to the biblical scholars to submit interpretations.Watch the film and you might come up with an entirely new theory.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is famous for several qualities a literate script for once in partlyreligious filmmaking by Philip Dunne some very good performances a firstrate production in every department and its intelligent direction by veteran Henry King. If one were making a film then getting such talents as Leon Shamroy as cinematographer Lyle Wheeler as art director and Alfred Newman as composer of original music would guarantee a quality production. Add the cast of this film including Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward as the title characters James Robertson Justice Raymond Massey Kieron Moore Jayne Meadows and John Sutton plus a dance by Gwen Verdon and expectations might be raised that the resulting film could be made into something special. But in a biblical subject script usually a subgenre prone to illogical motivations and miraculous interventions everything would ultimately depend on the author's skills. Philip Dunne here has supplied human beings a rare achievement in biblical films. David is a man in this film manysided not someone doing mythical deeds on paper in the Old Testament. Gregory Peck makes him curious passionate selfcontrolled selfdeprecating and appealing. As Bathsheba Hayward is scarcely the perfect choice but conveys a good deal of commonsense earthiness and emotional normalcy that helps one see why the King of Israel would risk so much for her. The rest of the cast is stalwart and capable by turns. The familiar storyline provides them little to work with but author Dunne and the cast do as much as is possible with the human situations. David's youth is told in flashback how he was chosen by a Prophet of Yahweh to be King of Israel and earns his way to be second to the king Saul by defeating Goliath the Phiiistine in battle when all else are afraid to beard the giant warrior. Thereafter he finally is driven from the court of King Saul of Israel becomes a famous warrior and returns to claim the kingdom and become the instrument of death of Jonathan the King's son formerly a friend. His wars are successful the film opens in fact with a successful attack scene but his life is empty since his wife Michal Jayne Meadows is Saul's daughter and is cold to him. He turns to Bathsheba whom he sees from the palace roof bathing naked later she admits she had hoped he would see her. But she has a husband Uriah when she becomes pregnant it becomes necessary for Uriah to come in from the battlefield and spend time at home he instead asks David to set him in the forefront of the battle even after being aroused by Verdon's dance. David agrees. He is killed a war hero but this does not solve the infidelity question. Drought comes to Israel and the king's infidelity is blamed for the phenomenon. At last David places his hands on the Ark of the Covenant recently brought to Jerusalem and housed in a temple which has caused the death of others who accidentally came in contact with it inviting his god to punish himand nothing happens...David exits the temple and finds that rain has come to his parched land. This film is always interesting varied in its types of scenes and physically beautiful. The director and author make use of the observer principle and are frankly more successful in humanizing the characters than in almost any film outside the Grecianized Near Eastern canon wherein the feat is a bit easier since neither miraculous nor religious themes are made central in such adventures. . Wellremembered for its glowing realization fine performances and intelligent dialogue this dramatic effort bears repeated study.".

One could also feel David's anguish the nigh that Uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home. As well as the sadness when he was killed in battle.

Gregory Peck is believable and excellent as King David. The dialogue is a bit trite at times but still generally strong. Susan Hayward is beautiful and solid in her role as Bathsheba and Raymond Massey is a delight as Nathan. A bit plodding at times but an engaging telling of one of the most famous stories of all time. The scenes of David playing the harp while reciting the 23rd Psalm and the David and Goliath scene must have a challenge to put on film but they are amazingly well done. A moving story a classic movie.".

The scenes of David playing the harp while reciting the 23rd Psalm and the David and Goliath scene must have a challenge to put on film but they are amazingly well done. A moving story a classic movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "I am quite surprised at the quite low rating for David and Bathsheba. True it does get rather ponderous in its pace and some scenes go on for too long but for me actually it is quite an interesting film. The film does look great the photography is colourful and just lovely while the sets and costumes are surprisingly evocative. As is Alfred Newman's score which is also very beautiful and stirring.I also thought Henry King did a credible job directing the film and the script is quite literate and thoughtful. The story is interesting on the whole some scenes as I've said do drag and don't serve as much purpose to the story as much as it would have liked but the famous fight with Goliath flashback is cleverly staged and the last fifteen minutes moved me. The acting is fine Gregory Peck oozes with nobility here and I am still trying to get over how handsome he looks. Susan Hayward is both ravishing and sensitive while Raymond Massey is excellent as the prophet Nathan.All in all not a perfect film but interesting. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "...however if anybody tried to get an understanding of the Bible by watching this and other films of the 50's based on Biblical stories they would be very misinformed.In this film King David Gregory Peck is introduced to us as a man who in spite of his many wives is misunderstood and ultimately mateless poor guy. The film at first zeroes in on Michal daughter of Saul and David's first wife. She is complaining that he is cold to her he says that he no longer loves her and only keeps her as a wife to keep certain parts of Israel loyal to him. He cites her earlier disloyalties to him.Then he steps out on his terrace and sees Bathsheba Susan Hayward bathing and finds her beautiful. He orders her to be brought to him. Now the Bible is devoid of details but it is assumed that David intended to sleep with Bathsheba and then discard her in spite of his many valid outlets of sexual expression in spite of the fact that David knew she was married to a soldier in his service in spite of the fact that Bathsheba's consent might have been a non issue to a king of Israel.But this film paints a much different picture. Here apparently David has been set up by Bathsheba! She has plotted and planned to be bathing in plain sight of David and thus the two enter into some kind of strange marriage in which she is his constant companion and soul mate and he ignores the dozens of wives he has in favor of her.Then as in the Bible disaster strikes  Bathsheba is pregnant her husband Uriah has been away for a year and when her condition becomes known she will be stoned as an adulteress according to Jewish law. Just as in the Bible David tries to trick Uriah into sleeping with Bathsheba so he will consider the child his and when that doesn't work he gets Uriah killed in battle and marries Bathsheba.However the child dies shortly after birth. Hollywood has also added some extra punishments. There is a kind of dust bowl that forms causing massive starvation and then rebellion among the people. Nathan the prophet comes and brings  not only the promises of punishment for David's crime mentioned in the Bible but says that God demands the stoning of Bathsheba for adultery which actually never happened because the actual Bathsheba was probably being treated as property by everybody  she had no say in what the king did to or with her. She was not this Virginia Slim girl of the B.C. as portrayed by Hayward.So a major portion of the last half of the film is good it just never happened  as David tries to find a way to save Bathsheba from execution. I'll let you watch and find out how that happens. Let's just say the film is full of spectacle befitting the times.Now some asides  Gregory Peck looked every inch a king here  he did a good job as always. But David was a man after God's own heart yet several times Nathan approaches David about this issue or that and David basically tells him I'll let you handle all of that God stuff. Huh? How can David be after God's own heart if he treats the prophet of God as though David was a CEO and Nathan were the head of HR bothering him with paperpushing minutia? Hayward is good but she always said she did not like the fact that as Bathsheba her part was just to react to whatever David was doing.If you are looking for a good example of a Biblical epic in the 50's tradition look no further. Just realize that like every other such film of the times the facts are being played with fast and loose. Heck if you watched 1956's Ten Commandments you'd believe that Pharoah not letting the Israelites go was the result of a love triangle! Recommended for the acting and the spectacle of it all.".

	schema:reviewBody "If there is one piece of advice I can give to any Christian who chooses to watch Hollywoodmade Biblebased movies it is this Do not expect 100 scriptural accuracy because you will rarely find it in such movies. If you embrace this attitude beforehand you will enjoy Hollywood's version of Biblical history more.This film is no different. While it covers the key points regarding the illicit relationship which occurred between King David and Bathsheba a number of the events in David's life are out of chronological order.For example we see flashbacks of David as a young shepherd boy being anointed by the Prophet Samuel as the next king of Israel and then David as a slightly older youth killing the Philistine giant Goliath in the closing moments of the film.To incorporate these moments of David's life into the movie a bit of fiction is employed. These visions  or whatever they were meant to be  occur while King David has his hands placed upon the side of the Ark of the Covenant and is asking God for His mercy and forgiveness after his sins are exposed by the Prophet Nathan. Scripturallyspeaking this would never occur because as even the movie reveals anyone who touched the Ark died.Furthermore as I have seen in other movies of this genre sometimes words are placed in the mouth of one character when they were actually said by someone else in the Bible.Regarding this particular movie a case in point concerns King David's decision to place Uriah the Hittite in the hottest part of the battle against the Ammonites so that he will die. This movie would have us to believe that it was actually Uriah's idea to do this because he desired to show David his loyalty and bravery. The truth however is that it was David's idea because he wanted Uriah to die so that he  meaning David  could conceal his sin of adultery and getting Bathsheba pregnant. In short David committed outright murder.Another departure from the actual Scriptures occurs when following the death of Bathsheba's firstborn  who was fathered by David  the Prophet Nathan and the people demand that Bathsheba be stoned to death according to the mandates of the Mosaic Law. While this was indeed the punishment for committing adultery the Bible makes no mention of this concerning Bathsheba. What we are told in the Scriptures is that their punishment was losing their child as well as the fact that war and treason would never depart from David's house being as he had an innocent man killed.This film also paints a very hostile relationship between David and Michal who was King Saul's daughter who became David's first wife. While the Bible does inform us that Michal was a jealous woman and that God struck her barren because of it it makes no mention of her  or Absalom  standing up as witnesses so that David's lie could be exposed and so that Bathsheba would be stoned. These were simply fictitious plot devices.While I have enjoyed some of Gregory Peck's work  such as Moby Dick To Kill a Mockingbird etc  I didn't care for the way he portrayed King David. Peck plays a very dark scheming sarcastic manipulative David. In particular I didn't like his disrespectful attitude towards Nathan the Prophet and the way that he doubted God's Word being spoken through Nathan. David came across as being quite snobbish.Of course I recognize that perhaps Peck played David this way in order to emphasize how far he had strayed from the Lord once he had achieved fame riches and power. This was in contrast to the more humble David we see praying to the Lord before the Ark of the Covenant near the end of the film.All in all David and Bathsheba was an okay movie but I can't say that I was really connected to any of the characters and it didn't really excite me. In fact I think I enjoyed the 1997 David TV movie with Nathaniel Parker Jonathan Pryce Leonard Nimoy Franco Nero and Sheryl Lee more than this one. To each his own.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film focuses the epic Davidlife 1010970 B.C.  retelling his complicated family relationship rebellion his son Absalom  and generally tackling the intricacies of his love story with Bathsheba . He's a very human figure who is recorded in the Bible Samuel Books 1 and 2 conqueror Jerusalen and author of the Psalms . It tells from the prophet Samuel Raymond Massey appointed him  when after in his kingdom Saul Francis X Bushman and his son Jonathan were vanquished by Philistines . When Saul was murdered by a blade slashed himself David Peck claimed his reign by right of his marriage to Saul's daughterJane Meadows . The continued threat and domination of invaders countries forced the Jewish tribes uniting under a strong king  David. He's specially recorded for his acquisition of his favorite spouse  Bathsheba Susan Hayward though he had a harem  too . The new wife was accomplished by sending her husband named Uria Kieron Moore the Hitita  a warrior serving as mercenary into way in war. His throne was marred by the habitual dynastic fights between his sons  Absalom Barnett killed Ammon and after rebelled and was murdered . There are also developed various events about Davidlife  such as the arrival in Jerusalen the Ark of the Covenant with supernatural qualities  David playing harp  in fact  David had entered Saul's household as a sort of musical therapist  the Hebrew politics intrigues and pitting against the Old Testament wrath of the Prophet Nathan and  of course  David Goliath fighting is seen in flashback  defeating with a throwing wave a tenfoottall Philistine giant . Later rebellion Absalon and killing Ammon  succeeded Salomon  son of Bathseba  he inherited the reign at David'death and became himself a major king of Israel  building the famous temple of Salomon where held the Ark . David and Salomon were the two great kings of Israel.Interesting Biblical story with emotion  rousing battles  an intense drama about love and hatred  being some moments proceeded in slow moving pace . And including the legendary biblical fight between David and Goliath is well featured in the movie by means of flashbacks . The film's story from the Bible was based upon its books of Samuel I and II Chronicles I and the Psalms of David . Very good acting by main cast  Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward  Peck stated that the movie was written as an attack on McCarthyism which he strongly opposed . This Biblical epic contains good set decoration and art direction Thomas Little  Lyle Weeler George Davis but is a little boring and dull with long speeches that it makes stately pace  especially when David is praying in the Tabernacle where is the Ark of Covenant . The movie gets a colorful cinematography and evocative music score by the classic Alfred Newman . The motion picture was professionally directed by Henry King.

	onyx:emotionText "The film focuses the epic Davidlife 1010970 B.C.  retelling his complicated family relationship rebellion his son Absalom  and generally tackling the intricacies of his love story with Bathsheba . He's a very human figure who is recorded in the Bible Samuel Books 1 and 2 conqueror Jerusalen and author of the Psalms . It tells from the prophet Samuel Raymond Massey appointed him  when after in his kingdom Saul Francis X Bushman and his son Jonathan were vanquished by Philistines . When Saul was murdered by a blade slashed himself David Peck claimed his reign by right of his marriage to Saul's daughterJane Meadows . The continued threat and domination of invaders countries forced the Jewish tribes uniting under a strong king  David. He's specially recorded for his acquisition of his favorite spouse  Bathsheba Susan Hayward though he had a harem  too . The new wife was accomplished by sending her husband named Uria Kieron Moore the Hitita  a warrior serving as mercenary into way in war. His throne was marred by the habitual dynastic fights between his sons  Absalom Barnett killed Ammon and after rebelled and was murdered . There are also developed various events about Davidlife  such as the arrival in Jerusalen the Ark of the Covenant with supernatural qualities  David playing harp  in fact  David had entered Saul's household as a sort of musical therapist  the Hebrew politics intrigues and pitting against the Old Testament wrath of the Prophet Nathan and  of course  David Goliath fighting is seen in flashback  defeating with a throwing wave a tenfoottall Philistine giant . Later rebellion Absalon and killing Ammon  succeeded Salomon  son of Bathseba  he inherited the reign at David'death and became himself a major king of Israel  building the famous temple of Salomon where held the Ark . David and Salomon were the two great kings of Israel.Interesting Biblical story with emotion  rousing battles  an intense drama about love and hatred  being some moments proceeded in slow moving pace . And including the legendary biblical fight between David and Goliath is well featured in the movie by means of flashbacks . The film's story from the Bible was based upon its books of Samuel I and II Chronicles I and the Psalms of David . Very good acting by main cast  Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward  Peck stated that the movie was written as an attack on McCarthyism which he strongly opposed . This Biblical epic contains good set decoration and art direction Thomas Little  Lyle Weeler George Davis but is a little boring and dull with long speeches that it makes stately pace  especially when David is praying in the Tabernacle where is the Ark of Covenant . The movie gets a colorful cinematography and evocative music score by the classic Alfred Newman . The motion picture was professionally directed by Henry King. His direction is well crafted  here he develops a thoughtprovoking and broody screenplay . He was a expert on compelling AdventureWestern genre . Henry King directed classic Western as  Jesse James1939 The gunfighter1950 and The Bravados 1958 with Peck again .

	schema:reviewBody "While a slew of biblical films came out of the 1950s the universal favorites are BenHur and The Ten Commandments. Even though two powerhouse actors star in the film adaptation of King David's story and it was really successful at the time David and Bathsheba might not be one you'll want to watch every year. It's just a little corny dated and overthetop in a bad way. It could have easily starred Victor Mature and then no one would have ever remembered this movie was even made.Gregory Peck stars as King David a man with many wives and the love of his people but is still unsatisfied. Will rejoining his troops on the front lines of battle restore his old passions or does he just need the love of a good woman to make him feel alive? As he ponders this one evening he walks out on his balcony and sees Susan Hayward taking a bath in her housewith the windows open. I guess that answers that question.To me the most memorable aspect about this movie is what it was able to sneak past the Hays Code. The kisses were longer than three seconds there were blatant discussions about sex and in one scene both leads are lying down and Gregory Peck covers her body with his own as he kisses her! All these steamy elements were violations of the Hollywood censorship code and I'm pretty amazed that this movie was released with a seal of approval.So even though Gregory Peck is handsome and Susan Hayward is beautiful this isn't my favorite of either of their films. Susan Hayward is one of my alltime favorite actresses but I was forced to focus on how fantastic she looked to spare any criticism of her overpowering Brooklyn accent and the mediocre quality of the rest of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike the classic biblical masterpieces of Technicolor days The Ten Commandments Samson and Delilah Sodom and Gomorrah etc this biblical film is not about the power and wrath of God. Instead it's a very intimate story of a man's fall from grace and how he tries to find it again.While it can be approached literally as the story of King David's sins which brought drought death and pestilence upon Israel it is truly a secular story of a man who has lost his boyhood innocence. The power of the film rests in Gregory Peck's hypnotizing performance toward the end when having hit rock bottom he must answer for his life.Whatever religion you subscribe to or none at all this is such a powerful human theme because inevitably we all lose our way. Peck plays King David as a sort of religious skeptic always investigating the scientific explanation behind supposedly supernatural events. And that diffuses the biblical aspect of the film so that we may enjoy it on any level.ABOUT THE PLOT... If you've studied the Bible then you probably know the story and how it turns out. But if you're totally ignorant of the tale like I was then I guarantee you'll have a great time. The suspense of not knowing how this volatile situation will play out is breathtaking. With that in mind I won't say a thing about the plot and I suggest you avoid any discussion of it. All you need to know is it's about 2 people named David and Bathsheba.About acting technique and music. Very nice with only 1 minor complaint. In keeping with the times 1951 this can be a melodramatic film and by that I point the finger at the music. Certain powerful dramatic scenes are made a little syrupy with the characteristic lush Hollywood symphonic music of the Technicolor age. However there are a few amazing scenes where Gregory Peck delivers his monologues in absolute silence with a tight stationary camera on his face and those are the aforementioned scenes that are so strong they'll bring a tear to your eye.Directed by Henry King who despite his masterpieces never won an academy award in his 50 year career David and Bathsheba is so impressive it makes me want to immediately run to the video store and check out his other films particularly those he made with his favorite leading man Gregory Peck Twelve O'Clock High Snows of Kilimanjaro etc. Susan Hayward did a great job too. But this is really Peck's film and King wasn't shy about using Peck to the fullest. Don't hesitate to see this film if you ever get the chance.".

It was a work that grew as the film progressed to the end and dramatic tension increased. Susan Hayward is Bathsheba a married woman clearly more vivid than the young king she deliberately provokes. The actress is very beautiful has talent and was surely a good choice for the role. Jayne Meadows in the role of David's first wife Raymond Massey who played the prophet Nathan and Kieron Moore the young and dedicated Uriah were also excellent additions to the cast fulfilling their roles with great merit.Technically the film has only minor flaws. Costumes are good and magnificent to look at but I didn't like that Jewish star always on Peck's chest. I knew that this symbol only became attached to the Jews in the Middle Ages so that detail stank of anachronism. The sets were excellent and grandiose as Hollywood got us used to when it comes to biblical epics. The beauty of colors and photography that Technicolor provides are something delicious for our eyes perhaps even better than many of the digital features we are used to now. Soundtrack is good but it doesn't stand out as in Ten Commandments or Ben Hur.".

	schema:reviewBody "I grew up on the Christian show Veggie Tales and there is one video in the series called King George and the Ducky which retells this story for kids. In it the king wants his neighbor's rubber duck and steals it. The real story which is portrayed here involves King David who slew Goliath. He sees his neighbor's wife bathing and convinces her to have sex with him even though she has a husband. He has the husband killed and takes Bathshebathe wifefor himself. Long story short he repents of this. You can find this bibical story in 2 Samuel 11 and 12.This movie retells that story with Gregory Peckfrom To Kill A Mockingbird as David and Susan Hayward as the adulteress Bathsheba. Because the story is so brief in the Bible there is a ton added to the story. This usually bothers me but what else can you do if you are telling such a short story? The movie expands on the character's motiveswhy David wants to bang a married woman. Why that woman would dishonor her husband. And so forth. That's part of what makes this a strong Bibical film plot wise. Also Bibically David and Bathsheba have sex the day they meet. Here they have a few dates before doing so.And by the way the sex is heavily implied like in Lolitagrown ups will pick up on when it happens younger people may not know. Preteens and up should see it anyways.My favorite part involves David reciting Psalm 23 to her. It's a very special scene that they also added to extend the run time.David and Bathsheba may not be a perfect Biblical adaptation but for a Hollywood production it's fine. It's very good in its own right.".

You can find this bibical story in 2 Samuel 11 and 12.This movie retells that story with Gregory Peckfrom To Kill A Mockingbird as David and Susan Hayward as the adulteress Bathsheba. Because the story is so brief in the Bible there is a ton added to the story. This usually bothers me but what else can you do if you are telling such a short story? The movie expands on the character's motiveswhy David wants to bang a married woman. Why that woman would dishonor her husband. And so forth. That's part of what makes this a strong Bibical film plot wise. Also Bibically David and Bathsheba have sex the day they meet. Here they have a few dates before doing so.And by the way the sex is heavily implied like in Lolitagrown ups will pick up on when it happens younger people may not know. Preteens and up should see it anyways.My favorite part involves David reciting Psalm 23 to her. It's a very special scene that they also added to extend the run time.David and Bathsheba may not be a perfect Biblical adaptation but for a Hollywood production it's fine. It's very good in its own right.";

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1950s Hollywood was in love with making religious epics. The films made money and all sorts of salacious material could be mixed in...all in the name of Christianity! It was much worse in the 1940s when the films were often much more sexual and inappropriate. Instead in the 50s the sex was a bit more implied and the dialog a bit goofier. For every excellent religious film from Hollywood such as Ben Hur or Demetrius and the Gladiators there were some really awful films like Solomon and Sheba or David and Bathsheba. Perhaps it's because the prior films were not based on Biblical stories but were more about Biblical times so staying faithful to the Bible was not a serious issue. With the latter two films however there just isn't much in the Bible about these folks. Solomon and Sheba was based on just a few verses and David and Bathsheba only a small portion of one book. So to make up for this the writers took creative liberty with the stories embellishing them wildly and giving them some laughably bad and stilted dialog. As for David and Bathsheba it's also burdened by ridiculous casting. After all Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward?!?! Yup...there sure must have been a lot of extremely well coiffed redheads back in the times of King David!!So what does the film have going for it? Well it's in color and the print looked really nice.".

	schema:headline " The spectacle of unvirtuous kings";
	schema:reviewBody "In the final decades of Hollywood's classic era there was a longrunning series of biblical pictures  grand sweeping and extremely pious things for the most part at least. David and Bathsheba an early example from Fox Studios is one of the few to break the trend. It takes its story from scripture without deviating from the story as it is told in the bible and yet it can be viewed as a veiled attack on the tyranny of the Old Testament God.The screenplay was by Philip Dunne a liberal Catholic strong critic of HUAC but certainly not an atheist. His work here is ultimately an appeal to the softer side of religious attitude. It's a script with much meditation and discussion interspersed with bursts of wordforword biblical dramatizations. In this context the striking dead of a man for touching the arc of the covenant and who was only trying to stop it falling on the floor anyway take on an almost ridiculous quality. By contrast the elaborated dialogue between characters is subtly sophisticated. When the titular lovers first meet the two of them seek each other out with doublemeaning small talk. Upon hearing that Bathsheba has only spent six days with her husband he calls it only six days of your love. Six days of our marriage she replies correcting him in the guise of agreement allowing him to read between the lines that the marriage is loveless. The picture essentially becomes a drama of extramarital affair.And it seems the production was cast with that in mind. Susan Hayward is not beautiful in the conventional sense but she certainly has an alluring presence and the calm intelligent demeanour to deliver that dialogue with the necessary implications. Peck was apparently cast because Daryl F. Zanuck thought he had a biblical face. In actual fact Peck was rather ill at the time he had a suspected heart attack during filming and this probably contributed to his holloweyed haunted look from which his performance benefits. And Peck if anything ups the contentiousness of Dunne's screenplay with more than a hint of sarcasm in his voice as he complains that we don't have any Joshua to blow the walls down for us. The forces of Old Testament fire and brimstone are represented by Raymond Massey and you could hardly get a more biblical face than his skullthin piercingeyed visage. An unexpected treat here is James Robertson Justice a bit of a fixture in biblical epics often theatrical but disappointingly vague. Here he is the best I have ever seen him underplaying Abishai as a sober moral conscience with the sense not to fully speak his mind.And if you wanted a respected mainstream director who would give an atypical look to an atypical picture you could not do much better than Henry King. As usual King films the set designs which seem authentically barren compared to the more opulent biblical epics to create dark claustrophobic interiors. He often has one wall running down the side of the frame right up to the camera some object in the foreground creating an area of shadow across the bottom of the screen or his characters with their backs in a corner. In the scene where Bathsheba has her miscarriage he uses all these techniques at once to produce some particularly stifling images. Spartan as the sets are King gives them a life of their own with billowing curtains and spare bits of decoration prominently picked out. And then at some key moment he will arrange thing to draw all focus in upon the protagonists never allowing them to blend completely into the background.The only major trouble with David and Bathsheba is that pictures like this are most entertaining when rather than trying to engage sensibly with their archaic subject matter they went all out on spectacle and extravagance. That's why Cecil B. DeMille was so good at them. Nevertheless it remains an intriguing and refreshing take upon the genre. It was during a 1964 broadcast of this picture that the controversial yet breathtakingly powerful Daisy girl campaign ad was shown for the first and only time look it up if you haven't seen it. Perhaps this is pure coincidence or perhaps the slot was chosen because it was thought a lot of people would be watching. But it does seem that the campaign's fervent plea for peace and understanding in the face of arbitrary destructiveness chimes in very well with the message of David and Bathsheba.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has all the size and grandeur of many of the great biblical epics of the 1950's and '60's. But it is also perhaps the first that really humanizes the biblical characters themselves. This is a unique and compelling balance that helps us to realize that even great figures like King David are flawed people who can find their faith and greatness in facing these very flaws.The actors are all first rate in the film from Gilbert Barnett as David's second son Absolom through to the wonderful Susan Hayward as Bathsheba. Hayward is at her best in this film. Her own larger than life but very truthful style of acting is quite at home on the TV screen as it was when first seen on the wide cinimascope screens of the 1950's. She is the seductress of the piece but she plays the role in such a way that you sympathize with her.Raymond Massey does a great job as Nathan the prophet. As a child when I first saw the film Massey seemed like he truly had just conversed with the Lord himself and was an awesome sight. No doubt helped also by the great music composed by the always amazing Alfred Newman who also had great successes in other biblical epics like The Robe and The Greatest Story Ever Told along with perhaps 100 other films too! The cinema photography by Leon Shamroy is well done and adds to the size but also the intimacy of the film. Henry King a truly underrated film director who like William Wyler never really pigeonholed himself into any one genre pulls together a larger than life production that never loses sight of the love story between David and Bathsheba and David's own deep struggle with his faith in God. The path tread in this film could have been very hokey but King keeps it real and interesting all the way. Plus we never lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand the will of God just as David himself is struggling with the same. From the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the ark from destruction. David is not satisfied with Nathan's answer to paraphrasethat no one can understand the will of God. This is the journey we embark on right through to the powerful ending where David is finally confronted with himself.Finally this film belongs to Gregory Peck who is wonderful as King David. His David is a man you can believe could rule a country as King and Warrior but who was also at one time a gentle and faithful singer of psalms. This is one of his best performances.I don't see this movie on television much anymore but when I do I never fail to watch it. I think it still holds up very well today.".

	schema:headline " severe plot line problem";
	schema:reviewBody "While not a terrible movie it has a few serious problems. The problems start with the casting. Edward Furlong is cast to play the 16 year old son of parents played by Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson but at age 16 he appears to be roughly five inches shorter than Streep and is utterly dwarfed by Neeson. Furlong looks more like he was their 12 year old son than their 16 year old son.Next problem is that certain points you need to catch at the beginning of the film simply slip by far to fast to catch. In a murder mystery or something with major plot twists that might be tolerable but not in your ordinary family drama.But to me the most troubling problem and if you are determined to see the movie regardless you might not want to read on because this will give away most of the movie is that it simply does not make sense.The story is Furlong has pulled off the road with his girlfriend and parked in the snow gets stuck they argue and tussle with each other with him pushing her and accidentally causing her to fall facefirst on the car jack. He then flees. She's found rushed to the hospital and dies. The movie then deals with the family struggle of how to deal with this in court. Getting the kids' story out takes at least half the movie and by the time it gets out things are moving fast and little things like making sense get lost in the wake. If Furlong and the girlfriend TOGETHER had been absolutely unable to get the car out of the snow and the deep rut he had made in it it makes no sense that after she is spread out on the ground and unable to help he then gets the the car out by himself  that is the kind of inconsistency any prosecuting attorney would have latched onto and which any defense attorney would have seen as a major problem in court I make these comments as a criminal defense attorney.But that's not the only problem with the kid's story. It was supposedly an accident. He cared about her. He never wanted to hurt her. And yet after she is hurt he cleans up the scene gets that stuck car out of there leaves she is found and is STILL ALIVE long enough for an ambulance to reach her get her to an emergency room and have a serious effort to save her life before she dies on the table in the ER. The entire issue of her having BEEN ALIVE and left to die is ignored. Not mentioned once by him his family the girl's grieving mother his defense attorney the prosecution or the judge who heard the case. It is as if the director forgot that in the second scene in the movie we see Meryly Streep a doctor in the film called to the ER to help with efforts to save the girl long before we know her son was involved in the girl's death. The scene leaves no doubt I went back and watched it a second time to be sure because the inconsistency seemed so glaring that the girl was still alive when she reached the ER.But she was left to die by the kid for whom we are supposed to feel sympathy.Not only are there problems with the issue not having been properly addressed by any of the characters who would have addressed it the fact that we need to feel sympathy for the kid is a problem. Easy to feel sympathy for him in having his life thrown into chaos as a result of an accident.... hard to feel sympathy when he would have had to have left his girlfriend there to die and when in cleaning up the scene he would have had to have had enough contact with her she fell on the car jack and he removed the jack and put it back in the trunk of the car that he certainly should have noticed she was still alive.Despite strong performances from the actors and good cinematography the movie was a bit disappointing because of direction casting and the script.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reading the majority of comments about Before and After I wanted to guess the commentators'ages mostly in their twenties  thirties? and to assume that they were either childless or had never raised teenagers. As announced by the young voice when the movie opens this is a story of daily life that was changed in an instant and that afterwards the family was never the same again. It sounds like a tautology but most of our lives are not interesting enough as material for the movies and it is a rare script and director that can show daily life and have anyone praise its results. Ordinary dialogue too is a challenge because people as a rule don't speak in great cadences. Moreover if one is looking at the movies today anything that is not family drama contains a volley of expletives that passes for dialogue. So it is understandable that this movie did not rate high in the minds of the xgeneration. As a parent of teens however I found the film quite true to life. It's basically about how parents respond to a dire family crisis and how they must adjust to each other as a unit. We see how the son as played by young Ed Furlong is affected by the shock of this event. As an actor his fine portrayal as the sensitive young writer in Grass Harp is a parallel role and should be mentioned. As for the parents Streep was drawing on her experience as a mother of three and was not acting in the way one saw her in her obviously great roles such as Sophie's Choice or Out of Africa. This was a subtler challenge for her. With Neeson also a father in real life he chose to portray the father as impulsive strong and the embodiment of unconditional parental love. I felt that the parents were meant to be somewhat opposites and complementary she contemplative more intellectual and sympathetic he aggressive protective and reactive.Some viewers were disturbed by the unbalanced and unsympathetic portrayal of the dead girl's mother and the dead girl herself. How could it be otherwise and not be told from Jacob or Jude's point of view? This is not Rashomon  we were not meant to have different points of view defended. However the very casting of the mother and of the girl friend as being less well educated and of a different class was obvious and another true thing that often happens in families. Here howeverit is not the parents' disapproval that is important but how they respond to their son's guilt.Some viewers might say that my comments betray my being manipulated. Well all viewers are being manipulated in any movie and a measure of whether we like the movie or not is whether we resent or do not mind being manipulated as the writer and director wished us to be. If someone watched this movie hoping for the suspense of a crime drama they won't like it. If someone watched this hoping for dramatic acting as in the Oscarwinning roles of Streep or Neeson I would have cited Lamb as his earliest and strongest then they also would be disappointed. And if someone were watching this expecting something other than a presentation of daily life then they would also be disappointed because they would have found it flat bland even trite until something dramatic like the accident on Jacob's fateful date happens to jolt its members out of their routine and their complacency. That is what this movie is about. I found myself agreeing with the entire gamut of the parents' reactions which some viewers found stupid but that is how parents and even children often behave in a crisis. I also found myself understanding both Jacob's and his sister's emotions. Jude didn't have many lines but those she spoke were true and thoughtprovoking coming from a youngster of that age and maturity. One other crucial point is how the actors responded to each other as members of a family and I found that they were not only well cast but were all up to the challenge delivering themselves quite honorably. This incident could have happened to any ordinary family and there but for the grace of God go I.Of four  I rate three and a half.".

A youth Jacob is fighting with his girlfriend and she accidentally falls on a jack which kills her. The family grapples with whether or not to tell the truth not only the courts but to their own lawyer and police officer who is a family friend. Is it morally right to tell the truth that the girl's death was nothing more than a mere accident and hope that it will be believed or should a story be made up in the hopes that Jacob will be let off since the police have no evidence. The father in the interests of protecting his son wiped the jack clean of the blood.We learn of course that everyone is against the mother and son who want to just tell the truth especially the lawyer who is interested more in getting Jacob off the hook no matter how much of a story he has to invent how many lies he has to tell how many people's characters he has to besmirch. The moral structure behind the criminal justice system in the U.S. is uncovered as not one that seeks what is right or true but what kind of entertaining bipolar battles between the defense and the prosecution can be unleashed in a furious game of words.While the theme of the film is compelling the production standards are low. This seems more like a madeforTV movie. With big guns like Liam Neeson and Meryl Streep you'd expect better acting. While Streep's performance is okay Neeson seems like not the best choice for this role. Also the actor playing the second darkhaired lawyer seems too clownish for his role. Surprisingly I found that the young actors were the strongest. The actors playing the two children especially Jacob were extremely skilled.".

Then we get to mom's and Eddie's character's confession and the whole thing is a pukefest of gotchas and ridiculous moral claims about right and wrong which are at best pointless opposing claims about whether right or wrong and the law are the same thing.Don't misread me though.

But there's a lot to like here. For starters the performances by the lead actors are first rate. Streep and Neeson come across as real people tackling a real problem. I should also add that Alfred Molina also gives a solid performance as the defense attorney. Though the fact he looks like idiot movie critic Michael Medved gave me a few chuckles at times. The script gives most of its characters a fair shake. The parents are sympathetic at times but sometimes they make decisions we disapprove of. The townspeople and police are not onenote characters showing off more than one side.The movie unfolds at a pace that keeps us interested and informed. It's directed with an appropriate bleak look that suits the subject matter.There is one flaw with the movie however. I thought that Edward Furlong's character was repulsive stupid and hateful. I don't blame Furlong for this but his direction and his parts of the screenplay. I think a better way the movie could have gone would be to give him a mixed view neither overly sympathetic or hateful. This would make the viewer think long and hard about him and wonder if his fate at the end of the movie is correct or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers Sitting at the dinner table with his parents and little sister JacobEdward Furlong finally opens up and tells the story of what happened between him and Martha Traverner Alison Folland since Martha was found dead in the snow outside of town. Jacob was on the run as a fugitive from justice for the a week until he was found and arrested at a friends house. Last seen with Martha as he picked her up where she worked at Jacey's Ice Cream Parlor in town Jacob was the prime suspect in her death. Now after being apprehended and let out on bail he had to get what happened to Martha off his chest and the story wasn't a pretty one but it wasn't as bad as it could have been either. Jacob did indeed kill Martha but it was a tragic accident. Gripping story about a father and mothers love for their troubled son and how they went about to save him from being put behind bars for killing his girlfriend and how it destroyed their lives as well as of course the lives of the parents of the girl who was killed. Jacob's mother Carolyn Ryan Meryl Streep wanted only the truth about her son actions in regard to Martha's death to come out in court and felt that it would exonerate him. His father Ben Ryan Liam Neeson on he other hand wanted to do everything possible and even went as far as destroying evidence in order to protect him. Jacob in the end sided with his mother and wrote out a full confession which his father could not bring himself to sign. Jacob was 16 years old and needed his parents signature to make the confession legal and in effect threw himself on the mercy of the court. Jacob didn't bother to defend his actions which his father and lawyer Penos Demeris Alfred Molina begged him to do. Before and After is a story that has no happy ending no matter how you look at it for both the victim and the accused. Its realism makes the film more effective and believable then most movies about courtroom dramas which usually have copout and feelgood or surprise endings. The story is told in retrospect from Jacob's little sisters Judith's Julia Weldon point of view. You already see from the start of the movie that things were never the same for Julia and her family when the film started. Meryl Streep as the mother is both protective and at the same time confident of the court and jury that her son Jacob was to face in his trial. Liam Neeson as the father was just the opposite not trusting the jury to acquit his son no matter how strong the evidence was in Jacob's favor that Martha's death was an accident. Jacob went with his mothers feeling in telling the truth and leaving it up to the judge instead of going to trail. In the end Jacob and his family were left to see if he was right or wrong in that decision. Strong performances all around with a really powerful scene in the movie towards the end when Carolyn is confronted by Martha's mother Terry Ann Magnuson at the hospital where Carolyn works as a doctor. No matter how much Carolyn tries to tell Terry how sorry she is about what happened to her daughter Terry is totally unmoved to the point where Carolyn is overcome with tears. You couldn't blame Terry for feeling like she did her daughter was dead and Carolyn's son no matter what the outcome of the court will be is alive. Those in the movie acted as if they really believed in what the story was trying to tell us That a parent burying their child is the worse kind of tragedy imaginable no matter what the circumstances of their child's death was. The film also brought out that those who have a son or daughter who was responsible for that death will have to as well as their son or daughter carry that guilt with them for the rest of their lives as well.".

I walked away from it this time being even more impressed  overall  with it as a drama and with the much of the acting. And that's saying a lot because I very much dislike Liam Neeson and usually ignore films in which he stars.The story itself is rather depressing because it tells of the virtual disintegration of a family as a teenaged son is accused of murdering his girlfriend. The mother Meryl Streep is probably the parent acting most responsibly although she cannot conceive that her son might actually murder someone the That's just not him scenario that is all too common among modern parents  and I say that as a long time teacher and school principal. The father is taking more the attitude that he's guilty but we'll protect him no matter what  literally destroying crucial evidence.Streep and Neeson are superb here although that doesn't mean you'll like or respect Neeson's character. We've come to expect perfection from every Streep role and here she does not disappoint. Julia Weldon as the young teen daughter is also excellent very believable.As good as those performances are there are two disappointments. Edward Furlong as the son well...as his later career has demonstrated just doesn't have it to be a successful actor. His only real talent in this film seemed to be his ability to look mournful. He was almost painful to watch. And Alfred Molina...I've seen some performances of his that have been quite good...but not this one. I feel he totally misplayed the role of defense attorney.I thought the movie was quite good and the acting both good and poor depending on the actor. But twice is enough.".

Some find it a relevant character study others are hung up on the plot holes. To be more precise a gaping plot hole as the mystery of this plot is finally unfolded.To get in my point this is a movie. It's not the best movie ever made to me it doesn't really represent reality and there are plot holes but I simply don't care. I am more interested if a movie can involve me or even change me in some way. Sad to say this does not fall under that category.I am a great fan of both Liam Neeson and Meryl Streep. I will go as far as to say that Meryl Streep can play just about everything. But in playing a part that you perhaps invest a little too much of yourself in you fall victim to either trying too hard not to show that you're acting or trying to overact. For this film I wish the actors were a little more willing to overact. That would have made this a lot more enjoyable. Everything from the characters reactions to the machinations of the plot seem overly calculated. There is not a big moment of release as is normally usual in these types of film. Liam Neeson seems at first to be a buffoon in what he does to protect his son but then we get reasoning that what he did is exactly what you should do in cases like these. A little too much of a coincidence don't you think? As for Edward Furlong he looks so tiny. It is actually brilliant casting because never in a million years would you consider him a threat to anything. Liam Neeson looks like he could squash him with his thumb. Meryl Streep could probably kill him with one slap.There should not be made some significance about a movie like this. Don't dare call it reality. It is at least a distorted reality. Character study? They do a better job on something like any drama series you can think of.".

Meryl Streep's doctormother tries to look at things in a sane way but she is constantly overpowered by her brutish husband. She is a realist and knows what needs to be done. The father makes it so much worse than it could have been that options are really limited. Also Alfred Molina's lawyer role is so full of it. He chomps on a sandwich while talking about the most serious issue in the world. This is supposed to fill us with confidence he may be eccentric but I'll bet he's really good.

And even bigger question why did all of these great and established names committed themselves to this project? Thing with this movie its story is that it never reaches a level above average. No shocking surprises or twists no real convincing emotions no tension. It feels just like a very empty and distant movie. The story unfolds itself as a very unconvincing one since some very unlikely things start to happen in the movie. I just never understood the fact why the parents weren't desperate to get the truth from their son. They just eat together as an happy family when the son is being nothing but death silent about the whole situation. This would had ticked me off as a parent and would had driven me insane. Just imaging your son being the main suspect in a murder case but he doesn't say anything to you about what happened. I would feel so mad at him and terribly unsure but not Liam Neeson and Meryl Streep. Also the way how the entire suddenly seemed to be against the family seemed so incredibly forced and silly that it all became incredibly unconvincing. The movie doesn't make you sympathize enough for any of its characters or with its drama. It would had perhaps also helped if the boy was really innocent and had nothing to do with the death of the young girl at all.Yes there definitely are far worse movies out there but that doesn't make this movie a good one. Even though the movie never gets above the level of average it also never goes below the level of horrible. It's just a very average movie by the numbers.Meryl Streep Liam Neeson Alfred Molina Edward Furlong and John Heard are all actors that appear in this movie and it really makes you wonder why. I just can't imaging after reading the script that they seriously thought this would make a great powerful and effective movie that would leave a lasting impression on people and could even sweep some awards. All actors make some mistake in their careers and this movie seems to be one for all of them. Also some actors just get terrible underused in this movie. What was the point of the John Heard character? And why is Alfred Molina role so small in this. His role seemed like it could had played a far more important one for the movie. It could at least had given the story some more depth with its entire court proceedings.Not an horrible movie but I just can't think of any reasons why you should ever watch it.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The plot as serpentine as it was could have made sense. But it plays against human nature a good part of the time. Or maybe it was just the dialogue that wasn't human. I plugged along with this tired play only to see how it ended. It did. The idea that a 16 year old could get himself into so much trouble is not unbelievable. And after killing someone even accidentally one would probably become panic stricken. But I think it's human nature to try and hide the crime not just leave all the clues and drive your family car home with blood in the trunk including the mysterious bloody glove where did that come from? As for the father he should stick with art. By trying to hide what he assumes is his son's crime he only makes it worse. Meryl is a mother and she plays that part well. In fact she is the only believable character. Julia Weldon must be well connected because she can't act and that was a major drawback. The dichotomy of whether one should support family at all costs or seek the truth for all involved  for the sake of society is not new. As an artist if he were from Bulgaria or some such country Nelson's character might seem more believable. Everything is corrupt there. But here we still assume that the innocent may get a fair shake in spite of 6 years of the current regime's attempts to take away all rights of anyone they don't like. Never been a big fan of Furlong and his whining seems to be nearly continual in anything he does. Is there a casting call for whiners? There was a kernel of an idea in this movie but without the proper care it just became nutty.".

During the opening scene I braced myself for an onslaught of Sundance clichs but as the film progressed I was pleasantly surprised. Before and After is a gem of a character study with believable performances by Meryl Streep and Edward Furlong. Liam Neeson's performance as a father with a reserved psychotic sense of protection toward his son is one of the film's highlights. There were some weak spots in the dialogue but otherwise the script was wellwritten and engaging.Be prepared to be sucked into this movie it's slowpaced but the subtle suspense will make it nearly impossible to stop watching. Just when you think the film has told its story and can't develop any further you discover that you've seen the beginning of Act II instead of the film's climax.".

	schema:reviewBody "Day X starts off fast with a single individual becoming enraged and killing a coworker without any explanation as to why. Soon afterwords a group of people in a parking garage become infected and attack our main character Frank Chambers. These attackers have not died and come back to life but it is explained later that an airborne virus scrambles the brain and affects the blood making those infected with it hunger for the flesh of the living.The locations used in Day X are very cool. You'll see a lot of run down industrial warehouse interiors and exteriors and only a few lush garden like settings. I'm guessing they didn't have to build a set for this film at all. There are some locations used that could have been explored more but that may have taken away from the fast paced storyline. I don't like to give away the whole movie in written format but the story doesn't drag at any point in the movie it does however end rather abruptly. Maybe that was the filmmakers intent to get a sequel in the works. The make up effects are good some of the infected have a very nasty gory look while others have a quick dirty chimney sweep look.The CG is not pretty but it's very lightly used and not on screen long. Sound effects are a little fake towards the beginning of Day X but later on with shot guns and other louder guns they sound effects are perfect. Some of the actors are redubbed not due to language differences but most likely due to on set audio issues. The dialog feels a little forced from some of the actors while others simply had too much foul language written for their character. The camera work is really professional for an indie film. The making of feature shows some of the lengths the camera men went took to get some really cool shots. Over all I enjoyed watching this mix of horror with scifi. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoyed Dead and Deader 28 DaysWeeks Later or Undead.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK this film is straight into the bad special effects pretty much straight away with the really bad sound effects for the black guy in the car firing what are audibly obvious blank rounds.The people go from being ill to infected FAR too quickly for my liking quite literally a matter of seconds!. Right my 1st question. During the opening title sequence is there supposed to be no picture? Because as useful as that guy's narrative is I'd have preferred to see what was happening.Yes I understand they did it to save money but that shouldn't be an excuse. We have no explanation as to who the person he's carrying actually is or where she came from and he is far too free with his ammo in a handgun that normally only holds 15 rounds.One man organises the survivors he finds himself amongst. The soldiers sent to rescue him and his mystery woman are killed so he and 2 others are forced outside to collect keycards from the bodies which will allow him to enter a bunker which is close by.We learn little bits about the monsters in the form of a video dairy that crops up now and then during the course of events. It turns out although they look dead and eat flesh these aren't classic zombies as just shooting them in the head won't kill them.I did like the very vague reference to Night Of The Living Dead but when the team are returning back where everyone else is sheltering I couldn't work out how the guy with the beard got injured did someone shoot him by accident or was he bitten in the fraction of a second he was being held by the zombies?.I assume the mystery girl cured him after sucking blood from his chest wound and spewing it back into his mouth? We find out the zombies were infected by an airborne biological weapon called Series 14 and we're told the mystery girl IS the antidote to this virus.The film is incredibly slow for this kind of horror film there are tiny segments of action but not much. It's incredibly thin on plot and far too thick on explanations and pacing isn't very good.There are far too many boring lulls between what little action there actually is. The video diary leads to a seemingly obvious conclusion that everyone inside the bunker their going to is already dead.Whilst walking a perimeter guard the ex Army girl finds a door open and bloody handprints on the floor after securing the door she starts pulling open one of the boarded up windows for no explainable reason I assume when she touched the blood she got infected. She also doesn't seem to struggle much when she's being pulled out of the window and despite having a fully loaded pistol only fires it once even then that shot isn't at one of the monsters.The stoner guy freaking out and killing 3 monsters armed only with 2 knives is a bit surreal and he looks very weird afterwards I'm fairly certain he was bitten as he was being attacked.The escape sequence is very over done and we go from having no action to having far too much. Why the mystery girl suddenly decides to just run into the monsters to get herself killed is not explained and seems pointless yes admittedly from the look in her eye she's insane but what she does is truly insane even by the standards of the insane.The route they take to get to the van seems too long and far too risky they couldn't have planned something shorter and safer? The black guy dies in the van without ever having given them the codes so the 3 of them who are still alive and are driving to the bunker can't get in there anyway. Even if they could the mystery girl with the cure is dead.The key card did get them inside the bunker where the rather weird and extremely weak ending showed exactly what I'd previously predicted only zombies inside the bunker and noone else alive.A very weak low budget movie with little plot extremely bad pacing and a very predictable ending. Best avoided even for zombie movie fans".

Finally on one odd note I don't know for sure if she was Melissa Holmes Paula Kavanaugh Lyn Pierce or another actress but she has an uncanny resemblance to Barbara Olson the conservative commentator author and lawyer who used to be often seen blinking and adding her 00.2 to many a Larry King Live show. As YOU may know Mrs. Olson sadly died on the American Airline flight 77 that slammed into the Pentagon so it couldn't be her but with all of the conspiracy talks etc. I certainly did a double take upon viewing this feisty actress in this film.

The leader of the group turns out to be some government courier agent who was escorting some weird albino chick who is somehow involved in all of this.He isof course a black guy.Meanwhile in a subplot a group of scientists and military men are holed up in another compound conducting experiments on the zombies like in Day of the Dead.One of the zombies is especially mean and nasty and this sort of echoes Land of the Dead.This movie even manages to rip off the remake of Dawn of the Dead as the group fights their way from the warehouse to a van.Anyway this movie isn't nearly good enough for you to care too much about the plot.It's basically one big ripoff.The acting is terriblethere is no character development and the zombies are few and far in between.Since when has zombie movies turned into movies that show few zombies but lots of scenes where people are just TALKING about zombies? Sheesh! Special effects are pretty mundane....little black holes appear in the zombie foreheads when they are shot and we have a few shots of what are supposed to be guts being pulled but all in all the gore factor is lame.Much of the movie is just these people standing around in this warehouse listening to zombies bang around on the walls outside.Skip this low budget snoozer and rent something by Romero instead if you're hankering for zombies.This is just another poorly done lame zombie movie made by people who have about as much talent for movie making as Miley Cyrus does for singing.".

Special effects are pretty mundane....little black holes appear in the zombie foreheads when they are shot and we have a few shots of what are supposed to be guts being pulled but all in all the gore factor is lame.Much of the movie is just these people standing around in this warehouse listening to zombies bang around on the walls outside.Skip this low budget snoozer and rent something by Romero instead if you're hankering for zombies.This is just another poorly done lame zombie movie made by people who have about as much talent for movie making as Miley Cyrus does for singing.";

This movie was more of a prequel to the Dawn of the Dead remake rather than Day of the Dead because the zombies in this film also ran.

	schema:reviewBody "Where to start? The prancing synchronized soldiers or the fact that after holding this film back an extra year they still couldn't add muzzle flashes to the weapons firing? The overuse of Karo syrup blood to cover the lack of any FX appliances or the dodgy zombies running walking dancing across the screen while the camera operator looks as if he's having a seizure? Dolleys folks with a budget like this they should have at least been able to afford a tripod for God's sake. At least they managed to add a CGI explosion for the beginning even if it was the worst one I've ever seen to date. The opening 'gore' is as I said just ludicrous amounts of fake blood I mean a lot I suppose they expected since it was night shooting that no one would notice... I did. In fact only a blind man would miss just how awfully put together the precredit sequence is and that blind man would no doubt comment on how horrible the foley voices are. After the wonderful credits we get a few individuals that may have been able to act when they were playing the scene live but... well how can you act when the editing crew can't sync up your voices properly later? Laugh as you see lip matching similar to a Shaw Brothers kung fu movie from the 70's. After some horrible dialog to 'establish' the characters meaning giving them a quirk so we can empathize with them or rather just to let us know what archetype Ana Clavell pulled out of a hat for each character we get to the mental hospital where extras 'act crazy' meaning they probably showed them One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and said Act like this! We also get some expository dialog so we know the female counterparts are crazy as well and Emma is on Suicide Watch cut to across the street wrist scars rather than down the street. Why not have PLOT POINT flash across the screen a few times to beat it into our heads? We follow more dialog that is either horribly acted or badly written wait it's both! Eventually a thermos of undead doom comes into play as one of the patients open a thermos found on a garbage detail and alas drops it to release horrible CGI! It was neither radiation nor the wrath of god that started the undead apocalypse! It was some idiot in a bathroom with a thermos and some bad computer graphics! I'm still waiting to see how this ties in to Romero's Day of the Dead... Oh wait! It doesn't! Telepsychic alien invaded zombie type people that share pain but don't sometimes. Hell check Emma's sweet outbreak which is latex without any coloring! I can see how 75 of the budget went into special effects. You can also dig the guy that's so 'CRAZY' he eats vomit without knowing it! Hilarious! And above all CRAZY! You can also catch one of the actors squeezing pus from his infectious wounds or just pulling the latex off because he was tired of having the stuff on your guess is as good as mine. Have I mentioned that I have yet to really see a camera held steady yet? We eventually get some backstory involving a Russian pilot with the actor playing him at least showing off what he learned in High School and a badly carved scar of a naked woman that sets off the apocalypse. In the current time period a meat loaf monster runs amok through the hospital and well I hate to say it but the plot is linear and I'm making it sound more interesting than it really is. So far the best part of the film would be the hospital's head doctor's awesome bow tie... But... the characters are not really zombies.. they are extraterrestrial virus victims... Night of the Creeps did it better though. Upon reaching the zombie laden climax they break out a few appliances but still no blanks muzzle flashes or even squibs. Where did the budget go? Into Jim Dudelson's pocket? In the end well they don't end it but rather tie up nothing at all and leave it open ended as if to supposedly allow it to tie in to Day of the Dead only it doesn't. If there is a God he will somehow not allow Taurus Entertainment to make their money back via Blockbuster and Hollywood Video sales unfortunately they will. This movie has such horrible direction you have shambling zombies running zombies hyperintelligent pan dimensional zombies and an ending worse than Umberto Lenzi's Nightmare City. This movie just screams amateur on so many levels. After all the hype and promises they did remove the promised zombie baby in light of Dawn of the Dead 2004's zombie baby by simply cutting the ending off the movie.I applaud the efforts of Taurus Entertainment as the makers of the worst zombie movie ever. This made The Dead Hate the Living! look like an epic of BenHur proportions. It made me pray that a few zombies from Zombie Lake would wander on screen or that Uwe Boll would make a cameo. By far the most amateur weak zombie film ever produced in terms of plot acting special effects and cinematography. Burning this film would be an insult to fire.".

I believe that the producers are lying and saying that this was shot on film to make look the movie more important...but if this movie was shot on 35mm it have the worst photography of cinemas history. Well that about having a 8 million budget...yeah sure. Zombie Bloodbath 3 have more production value than this one.

Well thats about three hours of my life wasted. This was simply a crappy bad film. While it had better production values than say any Italian Giallo Zombie film of the 80's and left crap by J.P. Bookwalter and Todd Sheets in the dust it was still garbage. The writers didn't know if they wanted to make a Romero type Zombie film or a Return of the Living Dead Zombie film so the zombies bounce back and forth between the two. The lame opening tries to tie this craporama in with the Romero films but don't buy the hype. Every Day Has a Beginning is simply a rip off of Every Saga Has a Beginning from Star Wars and tries desperately to sucker the viewer into believing this has something to do with the Romero Films the five opening minutes of any of Georges epics are way better than this movie. While there are a few nice gore scenes there is no logic or real continuity in the story itself which kills the whole movie. Watch this crummy waste of time if you must but don't be surprised when the credits roll and you scream WHY DID I DO THIS TO MYSELF? You've been warned!".

The year and place should be familiar to everyone reading this but if it's not it is the setting for Night of the Living Dead. So were asked to believe that a Russian pilot delivering some sort of secret tampons filled with zombie hallucinogens is the start of the plague in Pennsylvania. However the outbreak is cleaned up in this flick it's stopped. Therefore Romero's entire trilogy or quadrilogy now never happened. If the outbreak is stopped then there is no Dawn of the Dead and certainly no Day of the Dead. So I ask you how is this a sequel to Day of the Dead? It gets worse. After the first ten minutes or so there are no zombies until the end of the movie! And the running time is 103 minutes. The writer and director Ana Clavell and James Dudelson have filled the time in between with an almost unwatchable drama that takes place in a mental ward. None of the characters here have any redeeming value. So it's a good thing that they all die. Everyone knows this is a just a cashin project using Romero's title. So I urge you not to watch it. In fact this may be the worst movie to ripoff old George. Lenzi and Mattei are better hacks than Ana Clavell so if you must watch one of their films.

	schema:reviewBody "I got a copy of this film yesterday for my birthday. It's really hard to get in Australia. I'd like to say first I am the biggest zombie film fan I know. I know also I'm the only one I know that even knows about this film. I don't think I am going to tell anyone about it but hey I will let you guys in on some little secrets. This by far the greatest zombie film of all time. The people that made aren't at all no talent hacks but pure genius. The story line is breathtaking. It is the perfect sequel and prequel that raises the bar on the original. Man if you believe that then you are as stupid as the makers of this film. This film is horrible. This film has made me so angry. The only other film that made me this angry was that night of the living dead anniversary edition where John Russo went out a shot a whole bunch of new stuff and slotted it into the original cut. But at least John was a creator of the original therefore I guess is aloud to mess with his own work. Please could some one answer me this. What does this film have to do with the original day of the dead? It has the same name slapped on it but that's it. This film is an insult. The only reason I can see that this film has day of the dead written on it is because the sleazy filmmakers want to cash in on some one else's greatness. This film should have been called something completely different like 'zombie turd'. They really stuffed up cashing in on the day of the dead name when they turned out filthy nugget. The lighting is horrible. The characters are forgettable. The story line is so so so bad. These people have no excuses. When I saw they had 9000 000 to spend on this film I was disgusted.

	onyx:emotionText "I got a copy of this film yesterday for my birthday. It's really hard to get in Australia. I'd like to say first I am the biggest zombie film fan I know. I know also I'm the only one I know that even knows about this film. I don't think I am going to tell anyone about it but hey I will let you guys in on some little secrets. This by far the greatest zombie film of all time. The people that made aren't at all no talent hacks but pure genius. The story line is breathtaking. It is the perfect sequel and prequel that raises the bar on the original. Man if you believe that then you are as stupid as the makers of this film. This film is horrible. This film has made me so angry. The only other film that made me this angry was that night of the living dead anniversary edition where John Russo went out a shot a whole bunch of new stuff and slotted it into the original cut. But at least John was a creator of the original therefore I guess is aloud to mess with his own work. Please could some one answer me this. What does this film have to do with the original day of the dead? It has the same name slapped on it but that's it. This film is an insult. The only reason I can see that this film has day of the dead written on it is because the sleazy filmmakers want to cash in on some one else's greatness. This film should have been called something completely different like 'zombie turd'. They really stuffed up cashing in on the day of the dead name when they turned out filthy nugget. The lighting is horrible. The characters are forgettable. The story line is so so so bad. These people have no excuses. When I saw they had 9000 000 to spend on this film I was disgusted. To think there are proper filmmakers out there that are struggling. I expect an apology from the filmmakers about this film. A few things that bug me. 1 The zombies talking. 2 The mutant zombie that had a lumpy arm. He was so funny. 3 When they find the thermos that supposedly been in the bushes for 35 years it looks brand new. come on that's basic art dept 4 It had nothing to do with day of the dead and should be called something different. zombie turd 5 The sparkles that float out of the canister infecting the people.

As well the fact that there's about ten different subplots surrounding the inmates that don't really make any real point of interest in the whole film that these combined efforts force the zombie carnage until the very end of the film. Even still these scenes are rather lame with various extras being swarmed over by the zombies as they scream in panic yet nothing is shown of the body dismemberment or entrails removing that seems to popup in the scene leaving the gore to remain in the opening carnage flashback scene as well as the assault at the end on the human assistants which gets some points but overall this isn't anything we haven't seen before and done better which leaves this one lacking considerably.Rated R Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.".

Day of the Dead 2 Contagium is silly has flaws drinks in the fountain of Romero's trilogy but it is not as bad as indicated in IMDb Rating and many reviews. The acting and the special effects are reasonable for a lowbudget movie it is extremely gore and nasty but I believe it should have had more dark humor like in Peter Jackson's Braindead.

One of the doctors who lives with his patients takes a group of guys on work detail and they happen to find...yup you guess it the thermos from 37 years ago. After trying to open the thermos to no avail for a while it finally opens and when the tampon applicator opens it looks as though Tinkerbell is infecting all around with this virus. People start to show signs of being sick and when a male orderly attempts sexual assault of a patient he gets bitten and the fun really begins...or lack there of.While this movie has loads of gore even it won't save the terrible plot the horrible acting and the annoying plot holes. Like the original zombies having an almost Borg like connection. One gets hit the others feel it what one sees they all see. One gets shot they all have marks baring the gunshot. Or how about the son of the worker who stole the evil tampon applicator who at the beginning it's indicated that he's a young child 1 or 2 years old he shows up seemingly knowing everything about everything. How does he know that?! And how is he able to just walk into a highly restricted psych ward with no identification? Especially when the head physician ordered that wing shut down and the orderlies armed with orders to shoot to kill anyone coming out of that ward? And of course the zombies sit there have conversations and wisecrack. I'm sorry but that should only happen in the Return of the Living Dead series because that series is for fun except the excellent third one where its' full on serious.All in all avoid this movie like the plague.

I returned home and slipped it into my player with an eagerness only compared to the 13th birthday that i received optimus prime. What happened next was 99 minutes of absolute rubbish. I sat there scratching my head thinking  wha? Acting? gross. Directing? laughable. Storyline?.Whats with the stupid shiny little flower things popping out of the canister? sheesh. A complete and utter raping of Romero philosophy and ideas. Burn it burn it burn it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The name inspires so much more than this film offers. I mean what the hell were they thinking even calling this film Day of the dead 2. Thank the high heavens that Romero didn't endorse this piece of wannabe trash! The story goes Back in 1968 a RussianSoviet plane is shot down and crashes near a military facility in Pittsburge USA. The pilot survives and is immediately taken into custody. Upon further inspection of the planes cargo an experimental chemical the interrogators coax the pilot into revealing that it's a virus actually produced in the US for release over Russian soil. Discovering this they leave the pilot alone with his contraband for a brief period of time Big mistake!!! As he is soon placed into guarded quarantine after being seen to open one of the small vials. Whilst there an extreme metamorphosis accrues his body dies and he has a sudden craving for human flesh. Before you know it the whole base is awash with the walking dead and then As usual the troops arrive to dispatch all involved. All except for a worker at the base hospital who steals a vial of the deadly agent hides it inside a thermos flask and drops it in some long grass after becoming a zombie and being shot. Cut to present day and the base now being used as a mental institution which is soon turned into hell on earth when three patients discover the flask. Now heres the rub the acting is possibly the worst I've seen in a very long time even the zombies and the story is just terrible. The only redeeming feature I use the term loosely is the makeup effects but I'm afraid even that can't save this awful addition to a great horror genre!Other zombie fans be warned this film has nothing to do with the Romero movies. THANK GOD IN MY OPINION!".

The only differences between these two movies is that Daybreak ate faeces. Oh and Daylight actually contained some character building  something this movie lacked altogether besides a 5 minute throw together of random unrelated scenes from characters' pasts  which was hard to follow at first but soon gelled into the familiar combo of underground puzzles and shallow characters. Take the tough fresh out of custody guy. One word  irrational. He opposes every obvious escape plan the others can think of. He also gets into a punch up with someone he barley knows whilst he should be worrying about being trapped underground in a swiftly flooding subway tunnel filled with gas leaks and caveins. The only bit I liked was when he died  which in itself was weak and also the very beginning  when the worker got doused in acid  that was cool. I won't go into the other characters or countless reasons this movie sucked  they're all the same  shallow weak and poorly acted. Now don't get me wrong  I liked Rob Cohen's Daylight  which is one of the reasons I hated Daybreak  it had the same basic plot but worse everything else. 3 out of 10 for the acid.".

Of course there may be some novelty value if you're in a good mood but if you are screaming with laughter it is because of how unintentionally funny the movie in its awfulness is. Daybreak is very poorly rendered visually it is very choppily shot and edited and the effects look as though they haven't even been finished. The sound doesn't do any favours either coming across as bizarre and the lack of audio authenticity dilutes any terror anybody is meant to feel in this situation because the threat is instead unthreatening. The dialogue is cheesy and inane and there is nothing exciting surprising or suspenseful in the story with listless moments that are so ridiculous you can have 10 for each time you laughedyou'll probably find yourself at over 1000. The characters are annoying stereotypical cardboard cutouts especially the loudmouth constantly looking for a fight and the acting is dire with a mixture of over and under acting and nobody even Roy Scheider can do anything with what they had to work with. In conclusion an awful unintentionally hilarious movie that should never have seen the light of day. 110 Bethany Cox".

It was a time of big changes the communist system collapsed a great Hungarian leader died while a very important historical character Imre Nagy executed after the 1956 revolution was finally given the honor of being buried. The setting is also excellent the movie really looks as if it was shot in 89. For foreign viewers however this film doesn't say much because it's full hidden of jokes that only we understand for example when the boys are sitting in a cab singing the horrible Opus song Life Is Life and at one point in the lyrics they sing Levelet Kaptam Life because in the 80s nobody knew what the singer says there. What I missed was the lack of the depth of the characters and the plot wasn't very strong either but we mustn't complain because Moszkva Tr is a massive standout in contemporary Hungarian cinema.".

Although this passage is cited from the revision in 1978 which has been caused by the earthquake that the movie De Grotzepuur had triggered the wording is still today so fuzzy that In Praxi every farmer can interpret it in his way. The biggest problem which stands in the center of the movie is the socalled Factory Farming or Mass Husbandry. A reckless capitalist fodder merchant convinces the old farmer Jokab Keller Schaggi Streuli in his last role to change his farm from a well but not extraordinary profitable enterprise into this modern kind of farming. He had already to rent a big part of his farm to his sun and still his finances are running backward. Would there not be the young animalloving wife of the sun the old man and his sun would have continued with their horrible abuse The movie shows naked and dying chicken crowded a dozen into a space that measures perhaps the space of 4 showboxes. We see pigmothers unable to reach their babies separated one from the other lying on concrete without straw and every animal muzzled in order to prevent them to bite their ears off. Even the separation of the young wife from her husband does not change anything. The Big Change however comes when the rain causes a shortcircuit and hundreds of pigs agonizingly die. Then everything starts to fall apart the fate takes over amongst others in the person of Walter Morath who at least twice had already played the devil. And the vengeance of the fate goes to the bitter end to the bitter end of the old farmer to be exact. I remember the audience's reaction to this movie in a St. Gallen cinema in 1975 when it came out. Women were crying men were shouting one should shoot the director the engaged AmericanSwiss animal protector Mark R. Rissi. Children uttered their wish to go to the next farm and liberate the animals. The movie's reaction was so strong that in only a few days several hundreds of thousands of signatures could be gathered by which the Swiss Government was forced to abolish the central points of the Animal Protection Law. The biggest foodchain Migros let eggs from non freelandchicken disappear from one day to the next and massively lowered the prices for organic veganfee freeland eggs. The sales for pork almost stopped for months. However almost as disturbing as the pictures which include Streuli taking a dying hen out of her catacomb laying her onto a wooden trunk and separating her head and body with an ax is the fact that this movie has the form of a Moritat according to the dictionary Murder Ballad but that is nonsense to a Moritat like f.ex. the MackieMesserSong in Bert Brecht's Three penny's opera. This and a specific style of shooting with seems to be the dynamical counterpart of the static pictures in populist newspapers almost give The Grotzepuur a comedylike touch.".

I am a great lover of cinema which has either been taken from live theatre or which delve into the realness of the human condition of human feelings which explore the depths of what makes people tick of what makes people think feel love hate of what makes people on celluloid be real live living people with character and personality and deep feelings. In this aspect Princesas is a beautiful moving thoughtful piece which deserves great accolade. I left the cinema with very very deep feelings running through my heart and mind such that I missed the busstop and in the end walked all the way home  about three kilometres!Without any doubt the young Spanish directors Amenbar and Len de Aranoa are now well above the more famous Almodvar. Princesas is about prostitutes. Well forget that it is about two beautiful people who find themselves working the streets  and the mobile cell phone  to get clients. But it is also about friendship love between two women who have had to drop out into the seamier world of the big cities  in this case Madrid.Len de Aranoa treats the subject matter with such poignant delicacy with such understanding sensitivity with such superb and tasteful exquisiteness that towards the end of the film more than one little tear dropped from my eyes. And that does not often happen.Candela Pea Todo sobre mi madre qv Te doy mis ojos qv and Micaela Nevrez in her first film offer us superb readings of their characters both are superb both won my heart. The chemistry between these two young women  Spanish and Dominican  was so magnificent you would swear they had lived all their lives together. They had me feeling for them for their situation for their loves and desires and hopes and Zulema wanting to get back to her child in the Dominican Republic. The music by Manu Chao and Gato Prez was at times a little over strident but befitting the telling of the story. There are also other pieces of music not yet mentioned in IMDb.Ramiro Civita's photography especially in the facial closeups is astounding bringing out the best of the actresses feelings anguish torments. Superb work though some scenes with handheld camera were at times chaotic. Nevertheless I pass over this.The same as in Te doy Mis Ojosqv we have here an important sociological document in the form of a film with a story to tell. Women find themselves in bad situations directly due to men's vain and stupid attempts at being superior over them. Men fail miserably as I have said in Te doy mis ojos this film makes me feel ashamed of being a man. So does Princesas. A beautiful warm tender hard story so wonderfully told. I shall see this film again before it is taken off from the local multi cinemas and will buy the DVD as soon as it is in the shops.Here is another film to add to the best six Spanish films of all timesEl Sur Los Santos Inocentes Mar Adentro Princesas Te doy Mis Ojos A los que Aman all commented on in IMDb".

Nevertheless I pass over this.The same as in Te doy Mis Ojosqv we have here an important sociological document in the form of a film with a story to tell. Women find themselves in bad situations directly due to men's vain and stupid attempts at being superior over them. Men fail miserably as I have said in Te doy mis ojos this film makes me feel ashamed of being a man. So does Princesas. A beautiful warm tender hard story so wonderfully told. I shall see this film again before it is taken off from the local multi cinemas and will buy the DVD as soon as it is in the shops.Here is another film to add to the best six Spanish films of all timesEl Sur Los Santos Inocentes Mar Adentro Princesas Te doy Mis Ojos A los que Aman all commented on in IMDb";

When that has been said it does contain a few clichs that keeps this movie from reaching it's full potential.Candela Pea fits perfectly in the role of Caye and she does an amazing job conveying the emotions of her character to the audience. Even more so this time than she did in 'Todo sobre mi madre'. In one of the last scenes she is on a date with a guy she hit it off with that does not know what she do for a living and the feelings she displays... It makes you wonder how the crappy Hollywood actresses of course not all of them got their jobs considering there are others out there who just leave them in the dust.If you're looking for a realistic movie about prostitution or just a story to live yourself into  take a look at this.".

It is a very agonizing movie that puts you in these intense characters shoes and you try to understand how they deal with their day to day struggles. Aranoa gives perspective and creates this underlying sympathy that continuously tugs at your heart strings.I felt for Caye the minute the movie started and she was walking into that hospital room to show the young boy a good time. How humiliating I thought to myself but she had no choice. Again you feel for her when you realize that she is living a double life. She tries to enjoy a quite lunch with her family but her phone is constantly antagonizing and bringing her back to her reality which for me seems like a living hell. I have seen movies before about prostitutes like Pretty Woman a typical American Hollywood film. It is sad and then it has a typical happy ending. Princesas is raw and real it doesn't turn Caye and Zulema's lives into a fairy tale. It is refreshing to see an original and genuine film about an issue that is prevalent in the world today. There are women all over the world that have no other choice. I feel like Aranoa's film is giving these women a voice. Prostitutes are people and they do what they can to survive.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fernando Leon De Aranoa has created a film showing the realistic struggles that might be experienced by anyone existing in society particularly the lower class. Princesas follows the life of Caye Played by Candela Pena which I find interesting because Caye means street and Caye works the streets and her friend Zulema played by Micaela Nevarez. Caye is a citizen of Spain raised in a middleclass family and Zulema is an immigrant from the Dominican Republic. Zulema has come to Spain hoping to obtain a working license and tries to save money to bring her son to Spain. There are other prostitutes who have immigrated to Spain and turned to prostitution as an occupation and this creates tension with the prostitutes that are Spanish Citizens. Caye Spanish friends are all prejudice against the immigrant prostitutes accusing them of stealing their jobs and Caye struggles to maintain her friendship with both the Spanish prostitutes and Zulema. The friendship between Caye and Zulema grows stronger as the movie progresses and their friendship helps them overcome obstacles.During the day the lighting in this movie seems very natural as if the sun is the sole source of lighting. This gives an authentic feel to the movie instead of Hollywood dramatization that can be caused by artificial lighting. The obstacles that the characters face are also realistic. They are not far fetched and their situations could potentially happen to anyone in their shoes. This adds to the realistic feel of the movie. Most of the shots in Princesas are done at an eyelevel angle which allows the viewer to get absorbed into the movie forgetting that it is just a movie and not reality. Whenever the characters have an emotional scene the camera zooms in showing a close up of their faces. This really emphasizes the emotion whether it's sorrow joy or anger and allows the viewer to feel more connected to the characters.The authenticity of Princesas will draw you in and the strong bond of friendship between two women as they struggle through life will keep you captivated feeling their joy and sorrow as you follow their journey.".

There are other prostitutes who have immigrated to Spain and turned to prostitution as an occupation and this creates tension with the prostitutes that are Spanish Citizens. Caye Spanish friends are all prejudice against the immigrant prostitutes accusing them of stealing their jobs and Caye struggles to maintain her friendship with both the Spanish prostitutes and Zulema. The friendship between Caye and Zulema grows stronger as the movie progresses and their friendship helps them overcome obstacles.During the day the lighting in this movie seems very natural as if the sun is the sole source of lighting. This gives an authentic feel to the movie instead of Hollywood dramatization that can be caused by artificial lighting. The obstacles that the characters face are also realistic. They are not far fetched and their situations could potentially happen to anyone in their shoes. This adds to the realistic feel of the movie. Most of the shots in Princesas are done at an eyelevel angle which allows the viewer to get absorbed into the movie forgetting that it is just a movie and not reality. Whenever the characters have an emotional scene the camera zooms in showing a close up of their faces. This really emphasizes the emotion whether it's sorrow joy or anger and allows the viewer to feel more connected to the characters.The authenticity of Princesas will draw you in and the strong bond of friendship between two women as they struggle through life will keep you captivated feeling their joy and sorrow as you follow their journey.";

	schema:headline " Challenging but thoughtprovoking";
	schema:reviewBody "The film Princesas premiered in 2005 directed by Fernando Len de Aranoa who was also the screenwriter Princesas. Len de Aranoa is a Spanish filmmaker who studied Imaging Science at the Complutense University of Madrid. He is also well known for his films Mondays in the Sun Family Barrio and A Perfect Day. In 2002 he won the Concha de Oro at the International Film Festival of San Sebastian. In 2003 he received a Goya Award for Best Film and for Best Director. In 2016 he also won the Goya Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Overall Len de Aranoa's films focus on the unfortunate social realities of Spanish Culture Fernando Len de Aranoa. Princesas is no different in this aspect. In Princesas Candela Pea plays the role of Caye. Pea has been in many films but is best known for her roles in the movies All About My Mother Princesas and Take My Eyes Candela Pea. The other main character Zulema is played by Micaela Nevrez an actress from Puerto Rico whose first film was Princesas with which she won the Goya for Best New Actress Micaela Nevrez. Both play the roles of prostitutes in Madrid Caye a native Spaniard and Zulema an immigrant from the Dominican Republic. They meet one day by accident when Zulema is with one of Caye's clients. Because of this immediate conflict which is matched by the already existent tension between immigrant prostitutes who work on the street and Spanish prostitutes whose role is a bit more hidden their relationship starts off rocky. However they quickly become friends after Caye discovers Zulema in trouble. The film focuses on their relationship but also on many other relevant themes. Starting in the 90s immigration to Spain became a very big commonplace especially from places like Latin America and the Caribbean during their rising economic hardship. Furthermore in Spain thirty nine percent of men have had an experience with a prostitute at some point in their life and there are about 300000 prostitutes that work in Spain. This is possibly due to the idea of prostitution as a freedom that the people were deprived of during the regime of Francisco Franco Fotheringham. Princesas' plot takes place within the backdrop of these concepts. Throughout the film the song Me Llaman Calle by Manu Chao continues to play and bridges the gap between Caye and Zulema. Although Caye is a prostitute she comes from a middle class family and isn't one of the street prostitutes. She and her friends sit in a hair salon waiting for johns to call during the day while other prostitutes who they consider to be below them like Zulema work out in the street. Although Caye's name is street just spelled differently Zulema literally is a representation of the streets. One part of the song translates to they call me whore princess also they call me street it's my nobility. Another part of the song transmits the idea that one day good men will come looking for them for the rest of their lives without paying for them. There is a point when the girls find a couple guys at a bar and seem to actually like them. When they walk away Caye asks Zulema if she's going to charge the man and Zulema responds by saying no today we aren't whores today we're princesses. Although some may look at this with a negative connotation of girls who need men to save them in my opinion it's a moment of hope within a film that demonstrates a very dark reality. The idea of being princesses instead of whores allows them to be people instead of objects. This song provides a successful transition from many different points of the film and helps the viewer to connect with the music the movie and the characters. By providing a sense of familiarity with context it helps the viewer understand what they should feel. Overall Princesas does a good job of demonstrating the difficult reality and context of prostitution immigration and discrimination in Spain by pulling the viewer in to feel emotionally connected and compelled to do something about the problems. There are many difficult scenes to watch including but not limited to one when Caye is on a date with a man that she really likes and goes to the bathroom. She's followed by a man who knows she's a prostitute and demands sex from her. From the audience's perspective it's especially difficult to accept what is happening because moments ago they were given hope that Caye's lifestyle could be changing. When the man enters hope is lost and the viewer is returned to the cruel reality. Another especially difficult scene takes place in the hospital after Zulema decides to get checked out. She is called in to get her results and immediately collapses to the ground. She appears to be in an immense amount of emotional pain and it can be assumed that the results were of grave nature. These scenes along with others aren't exactly the most enjoyable moments but they're crucial. Princesas is worth seeing once the context is understood. However for those simply looking for an easy movie to watch for fun it may not be the best option. It's a serious film that deserves real thought and reflection.In writing this review I accessed other sources to find contextual information in order to improve the content.

	schema:reviewBody "Prostitution is an interesting subject dealt countless times since the invention of motion picture. Sometimes in a humorous tone often dark a few times melodramatic and sometimes as oppressed. But Spanish director Fernando Leon De Aranoa's Princesas takes on an altogether new and different platform with equal doses of all these genres. Clubbed with charttopping music engaging cinematography and real awesome acting Princesas is one of Spain's finest and the best two hours one can have.The screenplay and story are fresh and tackle prostitution from a different viewpoint. There is racism rape communicable diseases family problems want of money and love stories. All in the bag but none is made the centeroffocus. The focus always remains the relationship between two prostitutes and how they despite being from different backgrounds come close due to the similar situations they find themselves stuck in.There is hardly any boring moment throughout. The screenplay twists and turns effectively. The character of Caey's boyfriend is very well developed. Their first date the scene in the bathroom 'picking up after work' are very well written and executed but what is marvelous is the character's culmination. Mutely looking at each other in the ugly situation coping up with their flaws and losses Candela Pena and Luis Callejo are just terrific in this scene. But what made the film for me was Micaela Nevarez' performance. The fact that she has acted in just two films baffles me. He character was strong and meaty and she uses the opportunity effectively.Candela Pena has a charming screen presence and shares an enticing chemistry with Nevarez. She is nature to the core and makes us laugh and sympathize with her at the same time. Her scenes with her family and her mother are another highlight. The background score is gritty and nerve raising but what steals the show in the end are the two songs by Machu Pinnu. They are meaningful hummable and bring the funfactor. Fernando takes a commercial approach  doesn't bother to make any social commentary. The film is realistic fun sad and entertaining. The center of the film is always the two characters the princesses dealing through their shortcomings and the sort of work that earns them their living.The film is filled with numerous story lines and undercurrents that happen simultaneously and depicts the lives of two odd prostitutes in Spain to near perfection. It is delightful to watch hardhitting at places realistic but amusing entertaining and tells a wonderful story. A strong 8 on 10.".

The focus always remains the relationship between two prostitutes and how they despite being from different backgrounds come close due to the similar situations they find themselves stuck in.There is hardly any boring moment throughout. The screenplay twists and turns effectively. The character of Caey's boyfriend is very well developed. Their first date the scene in the bathroom 'picking up after work' are very well written and executed but what is marvelous is the character's culmination. Mutely looking at each other in the ugly situation coping up with their flaws and losses Candela Pena and Luis Callejo are just terrific in this scene. But what made the film for me was Micaela Nevarez' performance. The fact that she has acted in just two films baffles me. He character was strong and meaty and she uses the opportunity effectively.Candela Pena has a charming screen presence and shares an enticing chemistry with Nevarez. She is nature to the core and makes us laugh and sympathize with her at the same time. Her scenes with her family and her mother are another highlight. The background score is gritty and nerve raising but what steals the show in the end are the two songs by Machu Pinnu. They are meaningful hummable and bring the funfactor. Fernando takes a commercial approach  doesn't bother to make any social commentary. The film is realistic fun sad and entertaining. The center of the film is always the two characters the princesses dealing through their shortcomings and the sort of work that earns them their living.The film is filled with numerous story lines and undercurrents that happen simultaneously and depicts the lives of two odd prostitutes in Spain to near perfection. It is delightful to watch hardhitting at places realistic but amusing entertaining and tells a wonderful story. A strong 8 on 10.";

Centered on Caye the movie begins with her inducting the audience into the explicit business of sexual solicitation. Giving spectators a moment to retrieve those dehumanizing views that have historically plagued whores since prostitution began. Then with a twist of superb artistry director Fernando Leon De Aranoa invites viewers' into Caye's world which surprisingly happens to be filled with desire insight and awareness. Full of compassion Caye validates the fact that even those who are deemed societal outcast live sophisticated lives and deal with the same complications outside of occupation that confound us all. As we identify what is important and what is not. Her loyalty to Zulema concern for others and high morality balance her violation of cultural taboo while illuminating her light as a person.Zulema's character reveals the unsettling issues that the intrusion of mass immigration brings about a nation. She travels to Spain for the same reasons that many immigrants migrate to other places throughout the world. In search for better as a necessary means to provide for her family as a result Zulema's sale of sex for money can be seen as a struggle of survival not just for herself but for her son. Unfortunately it also can be perceived as a misrepresentation of a people because Zule's native counterparts have developed a negative regard for immigrants due to their gratuitous behavior. Her relationship with Caye begins over this conflict. But a person's color is a social construct Zulema and Caye's economic and social commonalities along with their aspirations overpower their racial differences. I would suggest to anyone watch the movie Princesas.Not because of its nature but because of its message. Fernando creates a film full of spirit. It confides in personal goodness over personal actions. Displaying good humanity as a feat anyone can achieve despite deviant behavior and illustrates that no one's life is more important than another's.".

	schema:reviewBody "This could have been a very important movie. The 1953 floods in which thousands of people lost their lives was probably the biggest historical event in the Netherlands since the second world war. As far as I know this is its first major cinema treatment with the technology to make the storm scenes credible. But that's just about all that's credible.The dominating storyline of a single mother in search for her lost baby supported by a deserted naval officer was melodramatic and totally incredible. The dialog was wooden and full of anachronisms the soundtrack often out of sinc with lip movements and the sappy swelling music in every scene irritating. Those whose mother tongue isn't Dutch won't mind but there is no attempt at regional accents by any of the main characters which would at least give the dialog a hint of authenticity. Some of the actors even had Flemish accents very different from Zeeuws.A big miss.".

	onyx:emotionText "This could have been a very important movie. The 1953 floods in which thousands of people lost their lives was probably the biggest historical event in the Netherlands since the second world war. As far as I know this is its first major cinema treatment with the technology to make the storm scenes credible. But that's just about all that's credible.The dominating storyline of a single mother in search for her lost baby supported by a deserted naval officer was melodramatic and totally incredible. The dialog was wooden and full of anachronisms the soundtrack often out of sinc with lip movements and the sappy swelling music in every scene irritating.

Along with Aldo who saved her from drowning she wanders through the flooded village to find her child. Although the visual effects are pretty impressive the story is simply not good enough.

As a mother and grandmother the storyline was very heartfelt as I think losing a baby no matter in what circumstances would be something you would never recover from fully. Even though several reviews are critical of the movie and its title I can see where the director and writer were coming from. Not only was it about the infamous storm of 1953 the main character also lived through her own personal storm whilst searching for her baby. This storyline took the viewer inside one story out of thousands from that period and personalised it by showing the event itself a mother's maternal instinct to protect and do everything to find her baby as well as the culture and moral expectations of the 1950s which were maintained even through such a catastrophe. I enjoyed the movie  as much as you can enjoy watching such a tragedy  and as the version I saw used subtitles the dialogue and outofsync moments didn't affect my viewing of it.".

The movie ends up almost ignoring the tragedy all those other thousands of people where facing during this flood. The characters in this movie aren't properly introduced so as a spectator you feel no connection at all with the leading roles.

Maybe it has to do with the history which the dutch have with the water. For nondutchmen The dutch have a long history in the fight against water. In fact half of the country is below sealevel and can only exist because of the so called Deltaplan a construction of dikes and other measures to prevent a disaster like what happened in the night of 23 february 1953. This disaster is the background of the story told in De storm .The story is about a girl who has just become a mother 5 weeks ago. In the complete madness of what happens after the dikes break and the water is in the peoples houses she gets separated from her child. The rest of the movie she is looking for her kid. In doing so we follow her and we see the full picture of what impact the disaster has dead cows in the water families ripped apart people praying to God others saying its Gods will etc.I would say the acting is done very well. The story is good. Only thing is if you expect to see a disastermovie like towering inferno day after tomorrow etc. this is not the wright movie for you. It is realism with a big touch of drama.Was the movie any good. I would say so. Story is good acting OK special effect are great you actually see the water flooding towards the houses a true accomplishment considering the low budget. For me the main reason to call this movie a good movie is the reaction of the people in the theatre. People were at the edge of their seat the whole time and I actually heard some people say Basterd! to someone who didn't want to help the main character. They were completely 'in the movie'.Maybe not an Oscar but certainly worth a nomination.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this at the local shop and thought it looked good. First thing I noticed is the movie's look is nothing like the images on the back of the box. It is almost as if they photoshopped it to look edgier and hide the fact it looks like a very poorly made home movie.The audio is poor. It doesn't sound right it's not synced. Some of the voice acting especially the barman is painful. There just isn't anything good to say about the sound quality.Visually the movie looks exactly like something some kid's made on a camcorder. I wouldn't mind the amateur colour and lighting. That's OK but what's really annoying is the excessively shaking of the camera. The idea behind the story is that a woman is following around some undead hunters to make a propaganda video to support the war on the dead. So it's like they want to really shove it in your face that this made on a camcorder and the camera shakes far too much. It's like they hired a drunken crackhead to film this.The act is even worse. It's not really worth talking about. If you have a puppy and he's a bit slow in the head I would imagine he could still do a better job.The action is nonexistent. There are a couple very tame scenes at the beginning where zombies are shot. But the rest of it pretty much them sitting in what appears to be the same field or the bar. You'll consider yourself lucky when you then get to see the very rare poorly done tame zombie shootings later in the film.You'll see better entertainment on Youtube for free.

It is almost as if they photoshopped it to look edgier and hide the fact it looks like a very poorly made home movie.The audio is poor. It doesn't sound right it's not synced. Some of the voice acting especially the barman is painful. There just isn't anything good to say about the sound quality.Visually the movie looks exactly like something some kid's made on a camcorder. I wouldn't mind the amateur colour and lighting. That's OK but what's really annoying is the excessively shaking of the camera. The idea behind the story is that a woman is following around some undead hunters to make a propaganda video to support the war on the dead.

	schema:reviewBody "I was rather excited to stumble upon the Dead Genesis DVD in a secondhand store as I had planned to purchase it from Amazon. So I picked it up believing I had made the bargain of the month. Especially the taglines on the front cover were enticing the mustsee indie horror film of the year and Romero would be proud.Romero would be proud? Of this movie? I find that very doubtful. The movie reminded me of something I would have been able to make with my own JVC Everio G GZMG130 camcorder. The movie was just one major shaky camera experience. I am sure that some people like these documentarylikedoityourselfwithashakinghand kind of styles in movies. But I don't! It gives the movie such a lousy feeling a feeling of something very amateurish and homemade. And this shaking camera thing the director thought was the right way to go was initially what made me turn off the movie about 1 hour into it.The story in Dead Genesis wasn't that bad actually but it was far from the best and most compelling storyline in a zombie movie though. However the movie was plagued by some really questionable acting performances. Now I am not saying that everyone was bad far from it. Most people actually did good jobs but there were a handful of 'actors' in the movie that were so bad that I sat and wondered how they made it past the screening process. Perhaps they were friends with someone in production? Especially that soldier guy on the pickup truck who was shooting zombies. Wow that was without a doubt the lousiest acting performance I have ever had the unfortunate pleasure of beholding.Dead Genesis does have a fair share of blood and gore which is what makes it almost worth to sit through the movie for. Almost! The zombie makeup was adequate some painfully fake prosthetics here and there but overall fair makeup and effects on the living dead. One of the better things in Dead Genesis was actually one of the first scenes where as woman was gorging on the entrails of a child. That scene was actually the one thing that stuck with me after turning off the movie after 1 hour.Normally I rarely turn off a movie before it is ended so a movie have to be really really boring of uninteresting before I do that. And being the zombie aficionado that I am I have to say that this movie was bad even for lowbudget zombie standards.It is now standing on the shelf of my DVD collection bagged and tagged and I know it will never get picked again and put into the DVD player. Not worth the effort sadly.".

It's pretty obvious that it's a low budget movie but I thought it gave the movie a neat edge IMO. I watched it once and thought it was pretty okay but then I watched it a second time and enjoyed it a lot more. It was refreshing to see a zombie movie that wasn't more of the same stuff we are used to seeing in a lot of other zombie movies. It wasn't all blood n' guts though the opening scene with the zombie kid was one of the goriest zombie scenes i've seen in awhile. Some of the acting is a little iffy in parts but thats to be expected with indie movies. But for the most part the cast seemed to do a good job better than most acting in some other zombie indie movie fare out there believe me.Positives The zombie make up effects were really well done. A few of the actors did a really good job. Loved the three main girls in the movie they were awesome. Decent story even for a zombie movie. Had a great first twenty minutes of the movie that established the whole zombie world the characters were in. The soundtrack for the movie was solid.Negatives The shaky camera stuff was a little distracting. Some of the audio was so so in parts. A scene or two dragged on a little long. Overall this is a pretty cool zombie movie. Not like most zombie movies kind of an unconventional one that favours characters over the zombies which I liked. Definitely worth checking out at least once. Think it deserves a higher rating on here too. And the special features on the DVD were fun looked like it was a fun movie to make.".

It's got the social commentary angle going for it and that traditional zombie spirit as well. Dead Genesis also manages to have one of the most graphic and gory openings to a zombie film that I've ever seen. Many have the grand epic openings this is much more personal and disturbing. It's a simple story almost like the flip side of Diary of the Dead where an attractive documentary filmmaker is making a film about the War on Dead. The War on Dead of course is a metaphor for the recent War on Terror. This filmmaker heads out into the woods and spends some time with a group of zombie hunters called the dead heads. Now this is where the movie slows down a bit. But I like it it takes a much more psychological view on the zombie apocalypse then other zombie movies do. And based on the ratings here I don't think many people seem to get the movie. She follows these zombie hunters along for a few days and starts to see that maybe everything isn't what it seems. These hunters who state numerous times that they're trying to protect humanity are far worse than the flesh eating ghouls who wander around seeking food. It's a brisk and interesting hour and a half good bits of dialogue between characters and plenty of blood and guts through out. There are a few things that don't quite work. This is definitely and low to no budget horror film. A few of the actors don't exactly hit the mark. It's also obvious that there wasn't much money to work with as some of the locations are pretty bland in parts. But it does have a lot of heart and that's where it counts. I read an interview with the director who said that he was directly influenced by Romero. This is clearly evident while watching the movie. It manages to echo the original Dead trilogy in a way that I haven't seen other low budget zombie films do. This one remembers that it's the characters and story that counts not the zombies.If you can find a way to check it out I highly recommend that you do.".

	schema:headline " A philosophical Zombie Movie?! Well That's Different";
	schema:reviewBody "In the first 5 minutes of this movie I was drawn in. What a great beginning! That kid must have zombie fan parents! It was sufficiently and realistically gory and heartbreaking. The zombies looked great. Good make up realistic blood and guts with good camera use focusing well on the action getting a good view! Only down side I noticed was the skin was a little too elastic When they ate the guts...you SEE them eating the guts!! I loved the new take on the old genre. Taking the zombies and making sport out of them. I have always thought especially with the slow moving Romero style zombie how easy it would be to subdue them. This movie is about the morality of killing. Even if it is zombies. Is it right to support the war on the dead This is the first movie that really explores in this direction. I thought it was a little satirical. But I'm a sarcastic person....It IS definitely a philosophical zombie flick if you can imagine that!! The acting was not Hollywood great but it was still done well enough I found myself interested and intrigued. It did roll quite slow and I would of liked to see more zombie action since it was done so well! Within 20 minutes the shaky camera syndrome was making me a bit dizzy but I didn't notice it too much after that. This movie is shown in the view of the lead character a female reporter and her investigations of a hunting group while out in the world hunting zombies with them. If you LOVE the genre like I do and discussionconversation in a movie doesn't bother you I think you should give this film a chance.".

Yes it depicts a zombie mother eating her child. It is not as jarring as the filmmaker intended. Mainly the child and I don't like to pick on kids is an atrocious actor. It was pretty cringe worthy. It looked like the kind of performance you'd expect from a couple of 12 year old's messing around with dad's video camera not an actual movie that people pay to see. And believe me it's only down hill from there. The audio is horrendous. The acting amateurish would be a compliment. The story lame and derivative. The only thing that could have saved it would have been some over the top violence and tits 'n ass. Unfortunately for Dead Genesis there is neither. As for the reviews praising the films deep philosophical story. I can only imagine those individuals have an invested interest in the production. Sucks to be them. Skip this piece of garbage. Go watch Exit Humanity Wyrmwood Road Of The Dead The Horde or even the new season of Z Nation is kind of promising. Don't waste your time with Dead Genesis. Thank me later...".

The blood violence depravity and gore of this film should satisfy the viewers who just want a straight horror flick. But the real impact of this film comes from a very basic but profound questionis it excusable in times of war to kill those you used to love simply because they are on the opposite side? And further what is the emotional and psychological impact on the people at the front lines who have to face that question and rationalize their actions every day? And can anyone who doesn't live it every day ever truly understand or reasonably criticize those who do?I know how silly this sounds for a zombie movie because believe me I've seen and enjoyed A LOT of them. But the truth is that the reason this film could be produced so cheaply and still be so effective is because it doesn't take many special effects or camera tricks to capture reality...it may not be zombies but these same external and internal battles are happening everyday across the globe and have throughout history.But just to be clear this film doesn't make you think too much. You can still enjoy it as a blood and guts horror flick because the bigger message is so obvious that it doesn't really require any deep thought.I hope you give this film a try. PS. I disagree with the filming creating motion sickness. The first time i saw The Blair Witch Project it made me sick.

The cinematography is strikingly creative and unique creating an environment of fear and dread while projecting an unsettling surrealistic atmosphere. The imagery is at times truly haunting.

How wrong I was and what a little gem this film is. True the occupants of the car do take a wrong turn Frank Harrington is taking his family and his daughter's boyfriend to spend Christmas with his inlaws but there this movie parts company with your average gorefest. This I believe is for three reasons.

How wrong I was and what a little gem this film is. True the occupants of the car do take a wrong turn Frank Harrington is taking his family and his daughter's boyfriend to spend Christmas with his inlaws but there this movie parts company with your average gorefest. This I believe is for three reasons.

	schema:headline " Finely crafted intelligent horror with excellent cast";
	schema:reviewBody "Dead End is an excellent example of what you can do on a low budget with a small cast and just a few locations. Mystery and horror are perfect genres to excel under these conditions and the filmmakers here take full advantage crafting a wonderfully paranoid claustrophobic and eerie dreamlike atmosphere. The movie is totally character driven and we spend a lot of time getting to know and care about the main characters. The gore was minimal but effective and there is one truly horrifying gore effect you will know it when you see it. The plot involves a family of four plus the daughter's boyfriend on their way to the mom's relatives for Christmas Eve. The father Ray Wise decides to take the scenic route and after a near headon collision with another vehicle in the first few minutes they pick up a ghostly hitchhiker and soon after the horror begins. The family is seemingly trapped on a deserted heavily forested country road unable to find their way out... Saying anything more will spoil your enjoyment of the film. Watching the characters react to their steadily worsening situation is a true pleasure as they convey the film's sense of horror shock and panic far better than any cheap gore effects or man in a rubber monster suit ever could. As the story progresses the characters reveal dark secrets about themselves that really add to the fun... things they would not have said were things not looking so grim!I really loved this movie up to a point. The ending was predictable clichd and a big letdown after spending so much time invested in the characters trying to escape their fate. However almost everything up to that point was a lot of fun especially the dialogue which was FANTASTIC. The main cast was GREAT especially Ray Wise and the actress who played his daughter. Everyone was great except Steve Valentine who apparently cannot act any different or better than his character on TV's Crossing Jordan. The female doctor at the end wasn't very good either I thought it was Shannon Tweed until I read the end credits!. Thankfully these two don't appear until the end which kind of sucked anyway though their rather poor acting didn't help matters it was ultimately the script's fault.The minimalist instrumental music is really creepy and worth mentioning.I give Dead End an 8 out of 10. With a revised ending it could have easily garnered a 9 or 10. In a sea of braindead garbage B and grade Z horror movies Dead End stands out at the front of the pack. I wish more low budget horror movies could be this finely crafted and intelligent. This movie is definitely highly recommended viewing for aspiring low budget filmmakers and horror fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Further proof that Hollywood just doesn't get it right anymore.When it comes to the horror genre simplicity is beyond best. It's the one genre where frequently the more feeble the material the better it can be.Dead End is an avatar of this principle. The plot is essentially just a concept film family driving in a car lost on a road that seems to not end encountering things beyond explanation along the way. There isn't anything complicated about that and there shouldn't be anything complicated about that. It's a script that builds in on itself instead of expanding outwards into new territory  yah I said territory. It doesn't continue to introduce new elements to the fold in the first 7 minutes it throws it's hands up and says this is what you're gonna get so take it. And I applaud the filmmakers for this. It's something seldom done in the genre these days. All too often do horror scripts follow a formulaic plot that spirals outwards instead of simply just constructing a boxed in realm of the film's reality and then letting the character's react realistically within it. Dare I say it is actually rather Shakespearean in this way? Oh I dare. Shakespeare was known for creating a story believable characters and then letting the play unfold as if the characters were realistically responding to the world created around them. This is exactly the scenario with Dead End. It avoids the most common pitfall of the genre characters that act without logic without interest and without motivation. It's something scriptwriters should pay considerably more attention to. Characters like these possess some kind of magical power that gives a 20 to any cinematic enjoyment. I cast magic characters! And speaking of those characters their actions may be realistically responsive but if it weren't for the remarkably energetic performances of all the cast then all would be for naught. Ray Wise is the man in this movie. He is just badass without being over the top. He has created out of the father a man who is just trapped in an obviously humdrum life and transformed him into someone you just can't help but smile at every time he curses at his family. He is just great. Great great great. If I had to recommend the movie for any one single reason it would be to just enjoy Ray Wise.The rest of the cast is fantastic as well Wise doesn't eclipse the few other actors there are but they all compliment each other like they really were a family. It is the definition of on screen chemistry.Now the question you're asking is it scary? Yes and No. No it isn't ballstothewall horror. It does fall prey to the optimism of the genre but it's excusable and I'll get to that in a minute. The script is kinetic always driving ahead and only pausing as long as necessary to make a point or get in a scare. It's because of this that the film will never scare the  out of you but when it wants to it'll keep your heart rate elevated to the point that you're aware of it enough to say to yourself hey this movie is kinda freaking me out. I respect that. It knows it isn't hardcore so it does exactly what it should and keeps your blood pumping a little faster than normal throughout. I love that feeling. But I also have a wild imagination and so was consistently prepped for an entry into the negative space of the car windows or emerging ever so slightly from the edge of the woods. And that'll freak my junk out more effectively than what you do see.As for the film falling victim to the optimism of the genre. This is true but it is appropriately so. It doesn't establish throughout the rest of the movie that it should be taken as the hardest of horror so no pretending means no disappointment in the end. Oh and worth an important note for most viewers there isn't a whole lot of gore it really does leave a lot up to the imagination as it should but what blood there is isn't over the top and there are no CGI scares. Take that for what it's worth but it's worth a lot to me.That said I would have preferred a different ending. Not solely because I would have preferred a darker ending but simply because the ending has an air of unreliability to it. It attempts to mollify the question that the movie never asks but obviously the viewer will what exactly is happening here? and I felt that wasn't really necessary. I liked that the movie wasn't raising question after question. I liked that it turned its back to the whole issue so when the events of the last two or three minutes of the film hit the viewer or me at least they feel out of place.All in all this is movie that strips away the gloss and glamour prevalent to the genre as of late establishes the concept and then happily throws what it's got left at the wall. Yes it doesn't all stick but the little things that don't are more than shadowed by the much larger portions that do. Dead End is worth your time and money. Rent it and watch it by yourself or with a date but not in a group. A group would kill the pleasant intimacy that makes the film work beyond its bounds.I'm hesitant to say instant classic because obviously it won't be universally so but it deserves that accolade in my book. Check it out.The one sentence review Dead End is a fun ass genre flick that never pretends to climb Mt.

	schema:headline " A cult classic whichever way you look at it!";
	schema:reviewBody "Just saw it.On the outset almost everything about Dead End looked dead crappy. From the dead hammy acting to some thick and heavy dead slasher flick cliches. But if this cinematic maxim of its so dead bad its dead good is to be believed then Dead End is it.For some Dead good fun time was had. Serious!With many quirky spanners thrown into its works Dead End is thus a must watch if only to see for yourself why on earth a flick like this one so steeped in slasher movie cliches could have circumvented its genre constraints and worked so well and entertained so many?I have a soft spot for intentional B movies from Pumpkin to Bubble Boy. Which made Dead End one of those hardtoreview films. For the fun part of the viewing experience was much in discovering how it progressed from beginning to end and not in its other nitpickable shortfalls.This much is guaranteed though the test audiences enjoyed the flick.

	onyx:emotionText "Just saw it.On the outset almost everything about Dead End looked dead crappy. From the dead hammy acting to some thick and heavy dead slasher flick cliches. But if this cinematic maxim of its so dead bad its dead good is to be believed then Dead End is it.For some Dead good fun time was had. Serious!With many quirky spanners thrown into its works Dead End is thus a must watch if only to see for yourself why on earth a flick like this one so steeped in slasher movie cliches could have circumvented its genre constraints and worked so well and entertained so many?I have a soft spot for intentional B movies from Pumpkin to Bubble Boy. Which made Dead End one of those hardtoreview films. For the fun part of the viewing experience was much in discovering how it progressed from beginning to end and not in its other nitpickable shortfalls.This much is guaranteed though the test audiences enjoyed the flick.

There's a lot of creepiness in general with the woman in white the black hearse and just the desolate shots of traveling the same stretches of road over and over and over. I've seen this film three times now because I watched it with both of my daughters also and it still got to me. They both enjoyed it too and they're tough critics. Check it out.

	schema:reviewBody "Dead End is a good film to prove that the horror genre is NOT dead and that there are still young directors who approach the genre with the right attitude. The plot is nowhere near groundbreaking or astonishing but yet you couldn't care less about that. The directorsduo Andrea and Canepa  French guys put their energy in creating tension and socializing with the characters rather than to gross out their audience with uninspired gore sequences. For these efforts I think this film is a zillion times better than other overhyped new horror titles like 'Cabin Fever' or 'House of a 1.000 Corpses'. When you withdraw the gore from those films there's nothing left but an empty package whereas 'Dead End' at least has some depth and intelligence. This film has a good tempo a fair amount of suspense and it makes good use of the dark and unsettling woods where it is shot. Like I mentioned before it's not very original. Especially for viewers familiar with some early 60's expressionism highlights this plot and more particularly the endtwist won't come as a big shock. I can't really mention the titles 'Dead End' resemblances with as that would be the biggest spoiler one can give. There also are good performances to enjoy! Ray Wise seems to be boosting up his career by appearing in slick horror films lately. After his remarkable role in 'Jeepers Creepers 2' he now stars as the lead actor in 'Dead End'. The cute Alexandra Holden is good too and with a little luck I think she's might even become a big star over the next few years. The rest of the cast is rather unknown but they all deliver above average performances. Next time you're in the videostore ignore all the loudly announced new horror turkeys and pick this one. Dead End is the first film of Andrea and Canepa and I really hope to see their names mentioned again in future horror projects.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a surprisingly exceptional and effectively scary first film by these directorsI watched it twice last weekend. The following review contains no spoilers.It is Christmas Eve and the Harrington family are making their annual trek to Grandma's house. Frank Ray Wise has decided to take a shortcut on a deserted road through a dark wooded area. He is dozing while driving until his irritating wife Lin Shaye wakes up asking where the freeway is. In the backseat the obnoxious teenage Richard picks a fight with his older sister Marion's boyfriend while she sits silently. This aggravating family continues their drive realizing they are lost without a map. Then the father notices a traumatizedlooking woman in the woods. He stops the car and the woman holding a baby comes up to the door. They decide to help her and the horror begins.From the start Dead End seems very familiar. Like the story about giving a stranger a ride that Frank tells Marion you feel like you've heard this tale before. Anyone who read Christopher Pike or Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark as a youth will realize several scenes into Dead End that the premise is not original. However the genius of this film is that it is a completely fresh and truly scary twist and on a familiar urban legend. While it does have a few scenes of nasty gore this movie adheres to the less is more school of horror filmmaking and it is very effective. For a film that mostly takes place inside a car or directly outside of a car this is incredibly atmospheric. The surrounding woods and desolate road are daunting but you don't really realize how much so until something other than the constantly bickering family is in that space.There is a heavy dose of humor and funny dialogue mixed in especially when each family member starts to lose their minds. You will be laughing out loud at various scenes. Sometimes this goes overboard and some of the dialogue and characters' actions ie the scene where the brother goes and jerks off in the woods while the rest of the family is helping the traumatized womanuh? seem absurd. Honestly these characters are pretty unlikeable from the beginningI was almost certain I was going to hate the movie because of it. Richard is one of the most irritating characters in a horror movie in recent memory. If you can get over this in the first few scenes of the movie and the awkward metal soundtrack then you should be okay and properly scared by this movie.That said the performances are better than usual in a low budget horror movie. Ray Wise is great as the stubborn father trying to always be in control and in a Twin Peaks throwback he screams LAURA! multiple times!. Lin Shaye's Laura is successful at being alternately grating and hilarious. But the real revelation here is Alexandra Holden aka Anorexia Girl in Drop Dead Gorgeous as Marion. I look forward to seeing more horror! from this terrific actress.You will likely either love or hate the ending and it is easy to see how someone would take it as the director's easy way out. However after my second viewing the movie makes much more sense and the finale is rather clever. Even if you dislike the ending it would be difficult to deny that the hour and a half ride there was suspenseful scary funny and entertaining.Checkout this fantastic and smart movieit is one of the scariest horror movies this decade. This ought to be a nobrainer but be sure to watch it at night. Hopefully we will see more from these talented and creative directors. They clearly know how to make a horror movie which cannot be said about many of the current crop of filmmakers.My Rating 910.".

Here are the very few good points  the acting is decent especially Ray Wise as the all American father. The black death car is done well and has a menacing aura about it. It aims higher on the bar in terms of intelligence than most horror Bmovies.The bad far outweighs the good however.  The movie is not scary and has no real scenes of horror or terror. The movie is more of a black comedy and it really isn't that funny the jokes are mostly lame. All of the characters except for the father are very annoying and don't evoke any sympathy. The gore is mostly hidden and left to the imagination this could appeal to some but if you like gore there is a noticeable lack of it in Dead End. The movie is full of clichs the characters don't act realistically when they are being killed one by one the son jokes around as if nothing is happening the characters often wander off by themselves when they know there is something evil in the woods hunting them down and worst of all the ending. ENDING SPOILER The ending is a groaner because it uses that ancient cop out  it was all a bad dream! Yes that tired old clich the final twist is that the family got into a fatal car accident and the whole movie was a bad dream by the only character that survived  the daughter.

This is usually par for the course in any slash 'em up movie but more so in this one. I said kill 'em all and end the movie already. The way in which characters disappeared and wound up dead seconds later was hard to believe. No psychological thriller here.

Maybe you spend hours watching bmovie drivel and this was appealing because it had pseudocompetent actors and decent production value for what it attempted. But I was disappointed because of story. The end does not justify the means in this case. Yes there was a twist but a trick ending does not justify a lack of story logic to get there. This is a clear case of the script being written to the movie's end rather than building it on real human actions or the development of the characters. In order for the end to be believable you have to get the viewer there first.It was lost for me once they got lost and kept driving down this endless road. No one reacted realistically to any of the deaths. They keep driving down the same road despite it's 'horrors'. No one would do that. The mother would throw away the cell phone because she was scared. That was a 'contrivance'. A shotgun they bought as a present for an Uncle just happens to be in the back seat? Contrivance. They never once try to turn around and go back to the highway. Unrealistic. The characters were all clichs. There was enough substance and humor to keep me watching through the end but largely because Ray Wise gave life to an unrealistic character. No one loses a family member in a dark side road and then drives on hoping that something better will happen. I'm all for suspension of disbelief but...come on. Having said all of that I respect what the directors tried to achieve. I just wish they had let another writer polish the script before they started. Story is everything. It goes beyond new twists in the genre or guessing the ending. Cinema is a journey not a destination. It takes you out of your everyday life by getting caught up in another reality for a couple of hours. That reality has to be REAL or it doesn't work.It can forgive the lack of FX and the missed continuity or even the wilding beating pulse in the neck of the mother once she was 'dead'. That happens in even big budget films. That's expected in low budget. But the story has to be solid. You can't just buy it with a gimmick alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Dead Girl written and directed by Karen Moncrieff is a haunting story of how six women are affected by the gruesome untimely death of one young woman. Each affected woman is suffering in their own emotional prison. Arden Leah Beverly Ruth Rosetta and Melora all gain new life and opportunity because of their connection to the dead girl. Arden played by Toni Collette lives and cares for her abusive mother. Arden's mother Piper Laurie's character has such an emotional hold on Arden that she doesn't even feel that she can go on a date with out being humiliated. Arden finds the dead girl on her family's land and for some reason it gives her new courage to explore a life outside her mother's grasp. After the girl is removed from Arden's family stead she is taken to the local Medical Examiners Office. The Examiner's intern Leah Rose Byrne's character examines her and believes that she is her long lost sister missing for 15 years. Struggling to get past her grief since her sister left believing she is dead finally allows her to get on with her life stalled for so long. She and her mother Beverley played by Mary Steenburgen and father Bruce Davidson's character have different methods for struggling with the past. She goes on a date with Derek played by James Franko and begins down the road away from her missing sister and into a life of her own!Mary Beth Hurt plays Ruth a woman trapped in her marriage to an absent bastard by her strong religious convictions. Even after she threatens her husband Carl Nick Searcy's character for being gone all the time and for sleeping around she is conflicted about leaving him. Of all the characters she is the most pitiful and deplorable. Her religion stunts her common sense her past cuts it down completely. At the end of her story I wanted to punch her in the face. Ruth is my favorite character.After the dead girl is identified her mother Melora comes to collect and identify her body. Melora played by Marsha Gay Harden finds about her daughter who ran away years ago from her girlfriend and coworker Rosetta. Together Rosetta Kerry Washington's character and Melora collect the remnants of what's left of her daughter's life. Melora's is obviously pained by her daughter's death but her emotions become unraveled when she learns why her daughter left.Finally we meet Brittany Murphy's character Krista. Krista is the dead girl. Her sad and tragic life can really only lead to Arden's family farm. Choices she made and choices people made for her are equally gutpunching and in the end who made which decision doesn't matter anymore. All that matters is she died.The writing in The Dead Girl leaves you dumbstruck and in pain. It's as if Karen Moncrieff drew a line for each of the characters starting years before the dead girl and stretching years in the future. The dead girl is the point where each of the lines intersect and change direction. At first it seems the women's lives bear no similarities to each other but their differences are only as deep as a coat of paint. Each of them is shackled to the past tied away from the potential their future holds. They tug on their restraints waiting for anything to break them free. Each of the stories is full of unspoken fear and a frightening depth. All of the acting in The Dead Girl is astoundingly disquieting. Each of the performances is compelling and all of the actors were completely entrenched in character. Marsha Gay Harden's performance is the shining star of this film. Her character is a well mannered suburban house wife who learns in the probably the most gut wrenching way about her misjudgments and bad decisions. In a scene where she learns how her bad decision making has hurt her daughter the surprise and rush of emotion completely changed my view of the character. Her utter desperation and painful honesty made me wish I were in the room to console her. Each of the character's stories is shot in slightly different ways. The difference is subtle but if you pay attention you can see it. There is nothing exceptional about the cinematography but it isn't a big budget movie either. The Dead Girl won't be a revolutionary experience for anyone but it is one to see if you desire a strong plot and noteworthy acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Saw a screening at a film fest in Los Angeles last night and was completely blown away. The quiet intensity of the film draws out the audiences emotions without hitting them over the head with obvious messages. Everything in this film is complex and complicated even the cooking of a T.V. dinner. The subtle direction and overwhelming combination of acting cinematography and screenplay lets the film build mystery upon mystery drawing the viewer to its inevitable conclusion. Restating the plot would give too much away but the lines between life and death and their definitions are definitely called into question in this film. The acting in this film is of the Oscars allaround caliber and not one performance is wasted or without passion and skill. Brittany Murphy and Kerry Washington are so incredible you wonder why these women aren't getting more attention. Murphy particularly shines here as a teenage girl trying to control the downward spiral of her life. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant as usual giving us a multilayered character that could easily have been overplayed. Mary Beth Hurt offers a stunning and revealing portrait of a deeply conflicted character. Giovanni Ribisi and James Franco give surprising support playing against their normal type. The cinematography is lushly beautiful yet also edgy and raw all a perfect complement to the screenplay. The opening scenes featuring the desert are gripping and breathtaking. They mark a fantastic contrast to the rest of the film. Karen Moncrieff's direction deftly weaves the characters together revealing small pieces of a mystery bit by bit never stealing time from the actors and allowing this stellar cast to really shine. If you loved In The Bedroom this has a similar pace and feel. This film will knock you sideways while watching it and then will linger with you for days to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "Karen Moncrief has written and directed this terrifying searching agonizing and exceptionally fine story of the responses of five different people to the discovery of a dead girl. By dividing her story into chapters named after The Stranger The Daughter The Mother The Wife The Sister and The Dead Girl she offers us fully realized characters each of whom is affected by the opening discovery of a mutilated young dead girl's body. The technique of nonlinear film is not new but Moncrief raises it to a new powerful level a fact that makes this film one of the more sophisticated and successful of the past few years.Arden Toni Collette is a homely frail girl who accidentally discovers the dead girl taking a necklace from the corpse before reporting the discovery to the police. She is a caretaker for an invalid foulmouthed cruel mother Piper Laurie who berates Arden for being so ugly and for involving them in a murder case. Arden flees meets The Stranger Rudy Giovanni Ribisi a tattooed scary appearing guy who is attracted to Arden because she appears so innocent. He courts her with tales of serial killer manners and yet eventually gains Arden's fractured selfperception trust with physical contact. The next chapter introduces Leah Rose Byrne who works with Derek James Franco in the mortuary where the dead girl's body has been deposited for autopsy. Leah discovers markings on the dead girl that convince her this is the sister who has been missing for 15 years a fact that her parents Mary Steenburgen and Bruce Davison refuse to accept. Leah's tenuous hold on reality is altered by Derek's consolation and physical attention.The Wife episode offers a view of Mary Mary Beth Hurt and Carl Nick Searcy a married couple with mutual distrust Mary knows Carl has flings with prostitutes while Carl feels Mary is too controlling. Mary discovers a chest of torn bloody underwear in one of their business Storage Containers connects the items with Carl in a suspicion that Carl may be related to the death of the dead girl and burns them. In The Mother we finally meet the true mother Melora Marcia Gay Harden of the dead girl Kritsta Britanny Murphy as she traces the clues from the body to a seedy motel where she meets Rosetta Kerry Washington Krista's roommate and lover only to discover that the dead Krista ran away from home to become a prostitute and drug addict in response to a childhood abuse problem with her father. Melora is informed that Krista has an illegitimate threeyearold daughter Ashley whom Krista loved and Melora seeks to care for the only remains of the dead girl  her granddaughter and her lover.This film beams with brilliant performances Collette Harden Byrne Laurie Hurt Searcy Washington Steenburgen Franco and Ribisi are poignant in their depiction of damaged people whose lives are altered by the Dead Girl. This is ensemble acting of the finest category. The production values are strong and the director's control of what could have been a meandering saga is firm and keeps the story from becoming sensationalized. This is yet another brilliant little film that deserves a very wide audience. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Dead Girl";
	schema:reviewBody "The story brought memories of an old television cult series called Twin Peaks. A dead blonde girl's body is being discovered in the grasslands of an idyllic village and this provides the catalyst for the movie as the plot unravels to tell of the stories that centers around that discovery. In summary it had a total of 5 short stories all interweaved through a fragmented timeline and a host of characters in those stories who have one way or another played a part in the girl's life during when she was alive and after.The Stranger stars Toni Collette as the woman who discovered the body and how she gets thrust into the media limelight yet yearning for that freedom to flee from her domineering mother. The Sister tells of a pathologist's inability to fight on and continue her family's believe that her missing sister is still out there somewhere and not to throw in the towel and give up hope. The Wife will manage to rile you up with the story of a neglected wife and her hopes for reconciling with her estranged husband who prefers gallivanting late at night to spending time with her and of course with her decision to protect her husband's secrets to losing him for sure altogether when revealed. And The Mother reminds you that a mother's love knows no bounds. Hurt by her daughter's disappearance the worse case scenario happens and Mum has got to heal old wounds. It's a touching short and I thought one of the most powerful amongst the rest. And rounding it up like the last pieces of a jigsaw is The Dead Girl's story where we see a foul mouthed Brittany Murphy bringing it all on.The movie had excellent performances all round by the ensemble cast and it doesn't have any big bang moments to shock and awe. It's a dramatic story rather than a mystery thrillerwhodunnit. I was glad that it didn't go down the torture porn route although it could have but didn't need to. Leaving it where it is will already allow your imagination to run wild what the outcome will be. However this might serve as a let down to some as it might seem that it failed to want to bridge the missing gap in the timeline. Fragmented timeline and multiple parallel stories do seem to be the rage these days Babel anyone? but it all boils down to how much of a story you can make out of a single drop in the pond. That's what The Dead Girl feels like with the stories the inevitable ripples that fan out.You Are My Sunshine looks like a song very popularly used in end credits and so far I had thought that it was a simple childhood nursery song. But when used in this context it had a profound depth telling of longing and missing that everyone has their own sunshine that they hold very dear to. Recommended movie especially if you're into the fragmented timeline fad.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Dead Girl was some of a giant shock to me when I watched it last night. From the first scenes of the film heartbreakingly beautiful shot in the country terrain where a dead girl is found making changes in a lot of peoples lives.Turn your feelings on and buy it or rent it!The film is not a thriller though it's got a threatening edge all way through. It's a story about life and to a certain amount death and reminded me of great films like Crash and Grand Canyon. Though it's something completely different.I'm amazed that this went straight to DVD in my country because it's such a gem of acting feelings and torment. I love the nerve of the film and the only thing lacking here is that I want more in the end! Therefore I'd like to watch the film over again just to study the acting.The film is beautiful gritty heartbreaking hopeful and has a tone of uncertainty which makes you want it never to end. But it does end or it gives you a lot of hope. I'd like the film to go on to tell more about every individual in this story. So well written played and filmed is this that I really felt I was watching something special.This is a hidden gem that deserves more praise than it has got. I was completely blown away by the greatness. A quiet intensely and beautifully told film draws out the audiences emotions without making anything too obvious.The acting is really superb and the direction is first class. The cinematography is a perfect complement to the screenplay. The opening scenes featuring the desert are gripping and breathtaking. This film will linger with you for days to come. It's so well written and played by a star cast where absolutely everyone does their job flawlessly. I must say I was completely mesmerized by the play of Toni Collette Mary Beth Hurt Mary Steenburgen Brittany Murphy Pier Laurie Giovani Ribisi James Franco Rose Byrne Kerry Washington as well as the others.Can't wait for more from Karen Moncrieff. With stories like these she'll be the next woman up for Oscar for best film. Well done!".

	onyx:emotionText "The Dead Girl was some of a giant shock to me when I watched it last night. From the first scenes of the film heartbreakingly beautiful shot in the country terrain where a dead girl is found making changes in a lot of peoples lives.Turn your feelings on and buy it or rent it!The film is not a thriller though it's got a threatening edge all way through. It's a story about life and to a certain amount death and reminded me of great films like Crash and Grand Canyon. Though it's something completely different.I'm amazed that this went straight to DVD in my country because it's such a gem of acting feelings and torment. I love the nerve of the film and the only thing lacking here is that I want more in the end! Therefore I'd like to watch the film over again just to study the acting.The film is beautiful gritty heartbreaking hopeful and has a tone of uncertainty which makes you want it never to end. But it does end or it gives you a lot of hope. I'd like the film to go on to tell more about every individual in this story. So well written played and filmed is this that I really felt I was watching something special.This is a hidden gem that deserves more praise than it has got. I was completely blown away by the greatness. A quiet intensely and beautifully told film draws out the audiences emotions without making anything too obvious.The acting is really superb and the direction is first class.

The writerdirector of this very interesting complex little depressing film really took me by surprise with a tremendous script and creatively photographed look at how 5 stories intersect thanks to one dead body found in a field. I know most are already thinking Crash or Babel but this film is much more intimate and personal than either of those two big budget films.The story begins with emotionally bankrupt Toni Collette finding the body in a field near the home she shares with her physically invalid emotionally abusing mother played with brimstone by Piper Laurie who has quite the history of tough love Mom's!. The depths of Collette's loneliness are played out in one of the most painful first kisses ever filmed on her date with Giovanni Ribisi.On the surface what appears to be the most normal family we get the lovely Rose Byre preparing the body for burial and believing or more truthfully hoping that the body belongs to her long missing sister. The stress and depression in the family is so painful as mother Mary Steenburgen refuses to give up hope and dad Bruce Davison is just helpless as the women in his life are all lost to him. While Byrne thinks the body belongs to her sister she feel reborn and actually leaves her fetal position to date James Franco. However soon all returns to normal.Mary Beth Hurt and Nick Searcy run a storage unit business next to their home and they spend their time together arguing and going emotionally numb. Searcy escapes for long drives and comes home with no explanation. A little detective work by Hurt has her proving her love and loyalty to a man who does not deserve it.Marcia Gay Harden is the mother of the found dead girl. She goes searching for answers as to why her daughter ran away from home and how the daughter lived. The answers aren't pretty and most come from a hooker played by Kerry Washington. After much heartbreak the only sunshine in the film is discovered.The films final chapter delivers the last piece of the puzzle as we see Brittany Murphy the dead girl and her struggles to make some type of life for herself. Again painful to watch but filled with emotional drama.These stories are broken out here for a message. The acting of each of those named above is profound and never once over the top. Each story could be its own film yet the brief glimpse provided into each life is just about all we can take. Ms. Moncrief has created a gem and a view into life's pain that crosses all genders races and socioeconomic boundaries. OK I did smile once ... when I heard that Brittany Murphy's character has the last name KUTCHER!!".

	schema:reviewBody "A truly phenomenal work. The film is separated into five different stories and each one is intricately detailed and each one is led by a poignant female performance. I can't rave about this enough. Every story is so beautiful in their own way. I must say that I greatly preferred the style of showing each story in it's entirety and then moving onto the next one instead of continuing the tradition of the swarm of these ensemble films with very different characters linked by a small event that we've been seeing this decade. It showed some great originality to cut the stories into five different linked short films instead of mashing them all together and just showing pits and pieces of each story.The entire concept of the film is remarkable. How one very unfortunate death can be the new beginning of seven others. The end of one life leads to the reawakening or liberation of seven others. Such a phenomenal concept that was executed flawlessly. That alone makes it something brilliant in my eyes but then each story is filled with such strong symbolism and metaphors. One example of symbolism could be the color contrast in Leah's story. At the beginning there is just steely blues and greys to represent her dull isolated life. But then once she goes to Derek's party there is life and vibrant color seen all around the shining lights in the background and even the lights of the swingset. It's a truly beautiful scene.Every character is so rich and deep and bring out every kind of sympathy I could ever feel. The ending of most stories is formed with a strong scene of liberation and change that put a big smile to my face. Ruth's story isn't this way though in which we see a stunning scene of her realizing the horrible man that her husband is but in almost an act of defiance she shuts her eyes to his evil deeds. And of course Krista's ending has no liberation or freedom. Instead it's one of the most heartbreaking experiences of my life. We see this sweet adorable character light with joy thinking that she is going to see her daughter on her birthday. But we know her eventual fate and that she will never meet her daughter. It brought such tears to my eyes.The performances really blew me away. I was expecting them to be good but not some of the best of the year. Even Marcia Gay Harden my least favorite actress turns in a strong subtle and emotional work compared to her usual whinyannoying fare. James Franco really needs more chances to shine because he is one of the most underrated actors around. He completely transforms his strong hulky build into an adorable geeky character that makes it easy to see why he brings Leah out of her deep depression. I have to highlight the phenomenal work from Giovanni Ribisi and Rose Byrne in two of my absolute favorite performances of last year. Exceptional doesn't even begin to describe the brilliance of their work. They both get resounding nominations from me and the film is one of the five best of last year.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Dead Girl A film review by Brian Murphy The Dead Girl writerdirector Karen Moncrieff's a former television actress and director penetrating new film connects five women affected by the death of a young woman Brittany Murphy. The film split up into five chapters reads like a book with each chapter examining the changes in their lives brought about by the brutal murder of someone most of them have never met.The Stranger The Sister The Wife The Mother and The Dead Girl comprise a fascinating multiple character study of abused confused and repressed women. The murdered woman winds up being an altruistic sacrificial lamb that alters the course of others for better and for worse.Ms. Moncrieff has assembled a stellar cast. Toni Collette Little Miss Sunshine shines as Arden an emotionally bruised daughter isolated from society by her abusive invalid mother. After discovering the corpse of a young woman her world is turned upside down the media hounds her she is romantically pursued by a creepy grocery clerk the underrated Giovanni Ribisi and she rebels against her passive nature lashing out at a mother Piper Laurie who referring to her deceased brother remarks He God should have taken you instead! Rose Byrne is phenomenal as Leah a young woman desperately searching for a way to put the 15year disappearance of her sister to rest. While her mother Mary Steenburgen still posts ageenhanced pictures of her daughter desperately hoping for her return Leah wishes for her family to accept the fact that her sister must be dead in order for them all to move on. Her occupation as a coroner perfectly corresponds to her character. When she comes across the corpse that Arden discovered she immediately finds a birthmark similar to that of her sister. Finally feeling the closure she has been seeking Leah embarks on a life separate from work and her therapist's office. She responds to the advances of slightly creepy coworker Derek James Franco of Spiderman and has sex in a scene Ms. Moncrieff deftly designed to express release.Mary Beth Hurt as Ruth and Marcia Gay Harden Pollock present two antithetical characters seeking redemption for perhaps their denial. Ruth a religious forgotten wife believes her despondent husband may be a serial killer while Harden's Melora is the mother of a woman possibly murdered by Ruth's husband. Ultimately their choices define them. Ruth chooses to remain in denial while Melora seeks the cause of her daughter's decision to run away. In the end one is lost and haunted while the other earns redemption.Not to be forgotten Brittany Murphy 8 Mile as Krista a.k.a. The Dead Girl gives a spectacular performance that serves as the essential footnote to Moncrieff's film. Murphy delivers as a junkie prostitute who despite her troubled past is still a loving mother.Karen Moncrieff's script may have difficulty appealing to a mass male audience. Her script is gendercentric studying the growth or regression of several female leads. The few male characters involved are either initially or ultimately presented as unsympathetic withdrawn or potential sources of violence. This does not exclude children like the young boy who punches his sister in the arm. Men are not definitively portrayed as evil but the film does cast a wary glare in their direction.However Ms. Moncrieff's writing is insightful and her direction is expressive. She uses a myriad of closeups to showcase the talents of her fine ensemble cast and also to express a claustrophobic toneHer women are often emotionally stunted cornered by men or voluntarily succumb to their own fears. Their transitions define this empathetic yet brutally honest film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of The Dead Girl is broken into five chapters  each focusing on a female character connected in some way to a corpse dumped beside a highway. The first deals with a socially inept young woman who happens upon the body of a murdered girl during an early morning walk. Somehow the self esteem she gains from the discovery gives her the strength to escape from a constrained life. The second segment concentrates on a female pathologist whose older sister had mysteriously disappeared some years earlier. During her examination of the victim in the morgue she becomes convinced the corpse is that of her missing sister. The third narrative fragment relates how a neglected wife handles the unexplained absences of a sinister husband. The main character in the fourth episode is the dead woman's mother who arrives to identify the body meets her daughter's roommate  and in the midst of grief has an unexpectedly hopeful encounter. The last chapter tells the story of the murdered girl's last day and how she came to meet her killer.Needless to say the film is no comedy. The excellent direction strong characters and sensitive performances combine to lift it above the bleakness of its subject matter and each of the episodes is intense and contains surprises. If one were being picky one might argue that the placement of the victim's meeting with her murderer at the end of the film brings it to an unnecessarily downbeat conclusion  but either way the story has a powerful emotional resonance.".

We meet people who knew her people whose lives have been shattered by her passing and we meet the dead girl herself during the events that led up to her mortal exit. It's a very interesting structure and Karen Moncrieff who wrote and directed manages to make each story interesting and involves us quickly in the plight of each character which is essential because the stories are not very long. Although there have been many films focusing on disparate stories that intersect at some point Babel for example and Pulp Fiction these stories are more selfcontained so what we end up watching are gritty snapshots of the lives of people whose common ground was their relationship with the dead girl. The makeup effects on Murphy's corpse are chillingly realistic and the cinematography by Michael Grady is exceptional. Special performance nods must go to Marcia Gay Harden Josh Brolin Mary Beth Hurt and Toni Collette even though all performances in this pic which I expect will be ignored by most are totally authentic. One of the most moving and gutwrenching films I have seen for quite a while. Why? Superb writing. With that and great actors you can't go wrong.".

Not only that it really gets you by the throat due the sadness all over this flick and the excellent acting. You really do feel sorry for Krista Brittany Murphy and the fact that in reel life Murphy died of pneumonia anemia and drug intoxication makes it even more depressive. She died 3 years after this flick was made.Can't say you will feel happy after watching The dead Girl I found it a treasure that I have found out of the blue. But be advised. You have to watch closely to be connected to all the misery happening to the people. Just look at Arden Toni Collette who discovers the body of the dead girl and that fact changed her life completely because being terrorised by her mother she decides to move further with her life leaving her mother alone at her house and starts to date. She even goes full frontal but in a sad way. Or Ruth Mary Beth Hurt who's undressing at the age of 60 when she discovers her man is a serial killer.Nothing here gives you a easy feeling it's all about death losing things and loneliness.

This movie is now poignanter with Brittany Murphy's death at the end of 2009 since her character has the pivotal role. How do movies like this get passed by on receiving awards...? This cast is as good as any ensemble I can think of. The material may be a little rough murder emotional and physical domestic abuse distorted sexuality homosexuality child abuse serial killing mutilation cover up incestthere isn't much left out in Moncrief's script. . . but all of it is relevant and in sync with the plot and none of it is overdone.A note on Brittany Murphy's acting in particular wonderful performance! She breathes total credibility into her character and runs the gamut of the emotional spectrum without missing a hue. This only reinforces what many have said about her passing we have lost a very talented young actress. Each of the other performances are notably powerful. This movie is all about emotions allegiances betrayals love and hurt. . . it could not work without a first rate cast and a director's sensitivity to the roles. Who better to direct it than the writer? Who knows best what the characters need to reveal? Moncrief did a great job.What really got me about this film was its brutal honesty. Piper Laurie's abusive invalid character could well be one of the strongest harpies on film. A nice casting touch30 years earlier she played a religious zealot whose daughter Carrie ended up skewering her. That mother was surreally cartoonish not so in this movie. Another very credible performance by a talented actress.Everyone in this film was excellent. Marcia Harden Toni Collette Mary Steenburgen Rose Byrne Kerry Washington Mary Beth Hurtall wonderful in their roles and all the women stand out as having a sensitivity missing in all but one male role that played by James Franco and to a lesser degree the character played by Bruce Davison.The males either do not care or their misogyny disallows them to have genuine feelings toward women. Is it onesided misrepresentational? Sure . . . but not in the context of the plot. This is not a film about loving thoughtful menfolk. This IS a film about abusive and damaging men who opportunistically use women and to whom women are objects first people second equals never. What better way to portray the patriarchy than a murdered young woman? Perfect. Yet one of the thematically most troubling parts of the movie is collusion by one of the female characters.Women too carry the sickness of being hurtful. . . women too are portrayed as causing harm to others without considering the consequences of their actions. TDG isn't simply about bashing males. And why should it be?the human condition transcends genders.Perhaps the only weakness to me of this film had to do with continuity from character exposition. It wasn't disjointed . . . it simply didn't have a seamlessness it might have had. Moncrieff's solution to use chapter headings did not interfere with the film flow. But switching between characters might have been handled differently with less pause between. It isn't bad what she's done. And it might have been done without the chaptering.I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. We don't get acting this powerful in that many movies. Well worth the visit.The thought occurs is this a chick flick? Definitely. Women ought to see this. Men too.".

With all the critical acclaim of some films it is a real shame we don't get to see them all on the big screen still can't fathom how Little Children has not come to theatres here maybe the Golden Globe nom will get the ball rolling. Karen Moncrieff's sophomore effort The Dead Girl falls into the category of a great trailer for a movie that may not have gotten the press to catapult it onto top ten lists. It had been on my list of films to see and I finally got the opportunity to check it out. There is an allstar cast and an intertwining narrative which draws comparisons to a film like Crash yet presents itself in a different way. The characters are all connected by the titular dead girl yet never meet each other. We are shown each story separately without the contrived overlap last year's Oscar winner had. While some vignettes work better than others the overall film does succeed as a whole. Moncrieff has put some great performances on screen to display the powerful emotions needed to tell this story.The Dead Girl begins with the discovery of the slain woman in a field. This girl will be the backbone to our tale as her presence in that field commences a chain of events that will be felt by many people. Our first chapter tells the story about the stranger who found the body. She is a mousy woman who is trapped in a life she hates by her overbearing mother played with razorsharp viciousness by Piper Laurie who has made a career out of these kinds of roles. This primary section shows what could be a parallel to the final night of the dead girl's life and while effectively acted doesn't really add that much to the final story. The same could be said about the third chapter called The Wife. While we are introduced to a character that plays an integral role in the final chapter of the film the overall story is a bit lacking. What the wife does for her husband shows either the power of love or the strength of selfpreservation and that ambiguity takes a little something away from the effectiveness of the action.Where the movie really shines is with the glimpses into the lives of The Sister The Mother and The Dead Girl. These three chapters are heartbreakingly real and emotionally resonant. Rose Byrne carries the film in the second part with her performance as a med student who believes the body of a girl she is prepping for autopsy is her missing sister. The mental anguish caused by her sister's disappearance fifteen years prior has eaten away at her. She never has an opportunity to live her life because her parents and those around her spend all their energy trying to find their missing daughter instead of trying to show the one they still have the same compassion. When she believes that the search could finally be over there is a release from depression and a sense that she can finally rebuild her shattered life. Byrne's performance is rivaled only by chapter four's Marcia Gay Harden as the victim's mother who is trying to piece together why her daughter left in the first place. Acting opposite Kerry Washington against her usual type here as a beaten prostitute Harden shows the love of a mother and the sorrow of finding out that she might have been able to prevent everything had she just looked closer years ago.After catching small glimpses into the lives of those affected by the death of a hard luck girl we receive the payoff by seeing the last moments of her life in the final chapter. Played almost too realistically by Brittany Murphy she looks like she might have starved herself and gotten high each morning before filming we are given a face to the body. She is a girl with so much life inside her and a motherly joy for the birthday of her daughter. There is a love for her best friend and a favorite John of hers that can bring out a rage powerful enough to stand up for them at her own safety's risk yet her juvenile glee when things go right show how broken her character really is. She was raised on the streets and never matured into the woman she should have. Her childlike innocence just augments how cruel and random this world we live in is and how much pain one horrible act can inflict on complete strangers.".

	schema:headline " An overlooked gem from a talent who will surely break out soon";
	schema:reviewBody "The body of a young woman is discovered naked in a field. This film tells four short stories about the people around this person and a fifth about the girl herself. It is an amazing achievement like if Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu made a film where the story worked. The first segment deals with the woman who finds the body Toni Collette her unbearable mother Piper Laurie and the possibly dangerous stranger she meets Giovanni Ribisi. The second story is about a young woman Rose Byrne whose own sister has been missing for the past 15 years. Of course she misses her sister but her life has been consumed by her mother's desperate belief that her daughter is alive Mary Steenburgen plays the mother and Bruce Davison her father. When Byrne working as a mortician comes upon the young girl's body she thinks it may be her sister. Or at least she hopes so. James Franco also stars as Byrne's coworker who wants to be more. The third segment is about the killer himself Nick Searcy and his longsuffering wife Mary Beth Hurt an extremely religious and oppressive woman who has probably driven Searcy to multiple murders. Hurt discovers her husband's dirty secret. The fourth segment is about the dead girl's real mother Marcia Gay Harden who has to come to grips with her own failure as a mother her daughter ran to L.A. to become an actress and instead ended up a prostitute. The fifth and final stars Brittany Murphy as the girl. It's pretty hard to watch so soon after her death. It's absolutely devastating. Most of the movie is quietly devastating. The second segment even if it didn't directly connect with Murphy's character was the most powerful to me. Byrne and Steenburgen are both undervalued actresses and the climactic argument between them is extraordinarily powerful. My second favorite would be the fourth segment. Marcia Gay Harden is another actress who can almost never do wrong and she delivers here in a film of great performances hers is definitely the best. I liked the other three segments a lot too. Writerdirector Karen Moncrieff falls into melodrama once in a while especially during the final sequence though she ends it at a perfect moment encapsulating the film's major theme of motherdaughter relationships  junkie prostitutes are a film subject that is maybe a little too overexplored. But mostly she creates threedimensional characters and moving situations. Her direction is not unique but I'd rather have it straight than showy screw you Irritu. Plus the most overlooked aspect of direction is bringing out the performances and she does that over and over again here. It's a remarkable film that certainly did not deserve to be released pretty much straight to DVD though I definitely see how hard this one would be to sell. I want to see her first feature and I hope to see Moncrieff find a place in actual theaters in the future.".

	onyx:emotionText "The body of a young woman is discovered naked in a field. This film tells four short stories about the people around this person and a fifth about the girl herself. It is an amazing achievement like if Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu made a film where the story worked. The first segment deals with the woman who finds the body Toni Collette her unbearable mother Piper Laurie and the possibly dangerous stranger she meets Giovanni Ribisi. The second story is about a young woman Rose Byrne whose own sister has been missing for the past 15 years. Of course she misses her sister but her life has been consumed by her mother's desperate belief that her daughter is alive Mary Steenburgen plays the mother and Bruce Davison her father. When Byrne working as a mortician comes upon the young girl's body she thinks it may be her sister. Or at least she hopes so. James Franco also stars as Byrne's coworker who wants to be more. The third segment is about the killer himself Nick Searcy and his longsuffering wife Mary Beth Hurt an extremely religious and oppressive woman who has probably driven Searcy to multiple murders. Hurt discovers her husband's dirty secret. The fourth segment is about the dead girl's real mother Marcia Gay Harden who has to come to grips with her own failure as a mother her daughter ran to L.A. to become an actress and instead ended up a prostitute. The fifth and final stars Brittany Murphy as the girl. It's pretty hard to watch so soon after her death. It's absolutely devastating. Most of the movie is quietly devastating. The second segment even if it didn't directly connect with Murphy's character was the most powerful to me. Byrne and Steenburgen are both undervalued actresses and the climactic argument between them is extraordinarily powerful. My second favorite would be the fourth segment. Marcia Gay Harden is another actress who can almost never do wrong and she delivers here in a film of great performances hers is definitely the best. I liked the other three segments a lot too. Writerdirector Karen Moncrieff falls into melodrama once in a while especially during the final sequence though she ends it at a perfect moment encapsulating the film's major theme of motherdaughter relationships  junkie prostitutes are a film subject that is maybe a little too overexplored.

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this film at the AFI Fest at the Arclight Cinema in Hollywood last night. There was a brief Q  A with the cast minus the superb Toni Collette and the director. I accompanied a friend to this screening and really had no expectations I'd never heard of the director before but I was excited about the cast. And did they deliver... The film is broken down by chapters all stolen moments for the audience to piece together the 'mystery'. The chapters don't so much intertwine the stories as in Crash but they do have significant relevance to one another. Honestly I was not impressed by the story so I will not comment so as not to offend anyone if they did enjoy that aspect of the film. I did however enjoy the amazingly talented cast and their performances. The aforementioned Toni Collette and Giovani Ribisi create a believable uncertainty of what's to come... Rose Byrne not being the 'Dead Girl' completely owns her 'chapter' in the film surpassing James Franco and Mary Steenburgen as an undeniable screen presence that really captivates...The most engaging 'chapter' for me was 'The Wife' with an incredibly strong and eerie performance from Mary Beth Hurt whom I'd also never heard of but was arrested by her portrayal of a woman faced with the heat of an intense decision... Marcia Gay Harden was excellent as usual but in her shared scenes with Kerry Washington it is Washington who truly stands out to me. She stated in the Q  A that her role was intended for a Latina and that she had to fight for the part...And I must say she EARNED the role. I am Latin and I personally don't care if a Latina doesn't get to play a Latina. If the actoractress personifies the character and can contribute something more than a 'shared ethnic background with the character then I believe the role should go to that actoractress. Washington does the role with a Latin accent  and does a great job. Washington also stated that when she receives a script she usually knows she wants to be a part of the project because she can't put the script down. With 'The Dead Girl' she stated she had the opposite reaction. She couldn't get through it and kept tossing literally the script aside and that was how she knew she HAD to do the role. She wanted to challenge herself. ...As for Brittany Murphy she plays the part of a drugaddicted prostitute and most would say 'she's good at that'  and she is. But we have to give Murphy more credit than that. Her performance was extremely strong and emotionally raw. She only contributed immensely to the strength of this cast and film. I am not so sure how much the chapter breakdown approach contributed to the plot development but nevertheless these 'vignettes' were very engaging.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow this was really a powerful film. I went into it not knowing what to expect. I came out completely touched and completely entertained. The film consists of a series of segments that tie together the central story about The Dead Girl. Each segment's primary focus is on a particular female character and how circumstances have effected them. Each segment is dark and introspective. This movie is NOT a thriller and if you cant handle purposeful reflective pace. Some would call it slow but I never found the movie dragging at all even when minutes go by without a word of dialog. It was too tense and you were always trying to figure out how everything pieced together and the complex meanings and symbologies behind so much of it. Its a complex film and it doesn't go out of its way to inform you what everything means or how everything comes together. I liked that. It left me with a thousand questions but at the same time feeling completely fulfilled. Thats rare in my experience. The viewer should be left interested enough to wonder about the details but not left confused and angry because there are gaps. And this movie pulls that off perfectly.As good as the writing is for this film the acting is flawless across the board. You have a series of segments where the main character is dead throughout most of it so there's never any primary focus for the audience throughout the film. Instead we are given one in each segment but because they mostly don't overlap segments you see all the actors fairly equally and it allows them all to shine. I truly cannot think of one character that I wasn't completely impressed with. Marcia Gay Harden was especially moving as the mother of The Dead Girl. She has a scene that I found so heartwrechingly well done that I could not contain my tears but I could not look away at the same time. Rose Byrne is also moving as The Sister. You can feel her torment like its painted on your skin when you watch her segment. And Kerry Washington was just terrific as well. All the acting was just stellar and honestly I cant remember a movie in my adult life where I actually came away noting that.If there's one drawback to the movie its that its at times unbearably depressing and dark and heartbreaking. You go from one troubled soul to the next without let up. And for me it ALMOST got to the point of being too much but Moncrieff pulled it out of a permanent depressive nose dive by weaving in hope and symbolism where there is only horror and darkness. She gives relief in the form of human connection in almost every vignette. So really a great film. Not sure how it went so under the radar or wasn't nominated for anything significant. I love that it forces us to wonder about the story behind what we are seeing on the screen. I love how it doesn't give us a standard story presented in a standard way with a standard wrap up ending. I love that its fully reflective and reflexive in so many ways. And its so deep. There's so much to pick up. I watched it several hours ago and Im ready to watch it again. I think thats the sign of a well done film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Dead Girl is an exceptional piece of filmmaking. The starstudded cast and their powerful performances give this mysterythriller profundity and emotional depth that will leave an impression long after the closing credits. The story is told in 5 different segments each focusing on a woman and their connection whether deep or superficial to the dead girl. Writerdirector Karen Moncrieff manages to convey so much about her characters and their depth in each short segment. We feel as if we know this character already and the film we see is just a peek into their lives.In The Stranger Arden the always wonderful Toni Collette is a painfully shy young woman caring for her ill abusive mother Piper Laurie and harboring painful memories of a young brother who died. After finding the dead girl in her backyard a grocery store clerk Giovanni Ribisi recognizes her from the news and asks her on a date. This series of events leads her to break free of her mother's grasp and embark on a new healthier life. In The Sister Leah Rose Byrne FX's Damages is a young student interning at the Medical Examiner's office who prepares the dead girl for her autopsy. Her family Mary Steenburgen plays her mother is grieving over and actively searching for her younger sister Jenny who disappeared from a state park 15 years ago. Deeply lonely and depressed Leah's notion that this dead girl could be her longlost sister seems to give her the closure she needs and to move on with her life accepting her colleague James Franco's invitation to a party at his home leading to a romantic relationship. The Wife is the weakest segment featuring the character the audience will have the least sympathy for. Ruth Mary Beth Hurt is a depressed woman in her mid50's in a loveless empty marriage to Carl Nick Searcy. Carl leaves for days at a time and Ruth suspects he is consorting with prostitutes and threatens to leave but doesn't have the courage to do so. After hearing of a serial killer on the news and finding suspicious items in the garage Ruth chooses to hide this evidence and continue looking the other way when it comes to her husband's actions as she has always done.The Mother features a heartbreakingly real performance by Marcia Gay Harden as the dead girl's mother Melora. She comes to L.A. to identify the body of her daughter whom she hasn't seen since she ran away at 16. Peeking at the detective's file Melora sees her daughter's lastknown address a motel room. She meets her daughter's roommate a dynamic Kerry Washington and begins to piece together the heartwrenching details of her life and death sliding the mystery into place for the final segment The Dead Girl. Brittany Murphy is raw gritty compelling and heartbreaking as the dead girl Krista Kutcher. A drug addicted prostitute desperately trying to put her life back together the audience watches achingly as the decisions that lead to her demise unfold. Josh Brolin appears briefly as her boyfriendclient. The ending is brilliantly devastating in its subtlety and simplicity. The audience knows what happens. This story is not about showing the gory details. The Dead Girl is told masterfully with each successive segment involving you deeply in each character's life while unfolding pieces of the larger puzzle. Absorbing and realistic while certainly not a happy or uplifting story The Dead Girl is a beautiful portrayal of women's lives and their struggles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since mid2006 when I first heard that Toni Collette was going to be starring in a movie called 'The Dead Girl' I've been very curious about this flick. Naturally as these things go nowadays the film came and went without even a hint of which two theaters played it during its weeklong appearance to the public...and then it was 19.99 as the starting price at Target and then it sat there in my home for months because nobody wanted to see a movie called 'The Dead Girl' that we knew nothing about. And so I watched it today. And my verdict is Well...What we have here is half of a good movie. Not to say that the other half was bad...but rather that there WAS no other half. I'm not part of the perverse crowd that wanted to see the actual...events leading to the titular girl's death but rather I wanted to see what happened with the rest of the characters in the WAKE of her death.We have Toni Collette's character Arden now in the hands of the mysterious Ray played with amazing creepiness by the evertalented Giovanni Ribisi. It is later mentioned by Ruth Mary Beth Hurt that Ray knows the killer Carl Ray Searcy and so Ray may or may not have something to do with the dead girl his sinister behavior and statements aside  and that's it. What's going to happen to Arden? And DID Ray have anything to do with the murder?And speaking of Ruth she's burned all the clothes of her husband's nocturnal activities...right after turning down her chance that she made for herself to turn him in. We never get any more of an illustration into her motives for her actions and although it may fall into the very real clich of women protecting their abusive husbands the lack of explanation is somewhat painful.Finally we have a whole introduction to the life of Leah Rose Byrne and her family and friends including a dramatic back story of her missing sister all of which revolve around her examination of the dead girl's body...who turns out to not be her sister after all. I would have liked to have seen more of an outcome for her rather than a deep introduction to a character who has a minimal connection to the rest of the story.Closure that is what was missing from this movie.However this is not to say that the movie was BAD. You'll notice that I gave it an 8 out of 10star rating I thought the acting was fabulous the script wellwritten as far as character interaction and scene layout were concerned and the film beautifully shot and directed. It could have been a solid film of a dark but fascinating story about life and death and people and while it was all of these things the story was snipped neatly in half.

	onyx:emotionText "Ever since mid2006 when I first heard that Toni Collette was going to be starring in a movie called 'The Dead Girl' I've been very curious about this flick. Naturally as these things go nowadays the film came and went without even a hint of which two theaters played it during its weeklong appearance to the public...and then it was 19.99 as the starting price at Target and then it sat there in my home for months because nobody wanted to see a movie called 'The Dead Girl' that we knew nothing about. And so I watched it today. And my verdict is Well...What we have here is half of a good movie. Not to say that the other half was bad...but rather that there WAS no other half. I'm not part of the perverse crowd that wanted to see the actual...events leading to the titular girl's death but rather I wanted to see what happened with the rest of the characters in the WAKE of her death.We have Toni Collette's character Arden now in the hands of the mysterious Ray played with amazing creepiness by the evertalented Giovanni Ribisi. It is later mentioned by Ruth Mary Beth Hurt that Ray knows the killer Carl Ray Searcy and so Ray may or may not have something to do with the dead girl his sinister behavior and statements aside  and that's it. What's going to happen to Arden? And DID Ray have anything to do with the murder?And speaking of Ruth she's burned all the clothes of her husband's nocturnal activities...right after turning down her chance that she made for herself to turn him in. We never get any more of an illustration into her motives for her actions and although it may fall into the very real clich of women protecting their abusive husbands the lack of explanation is somewhat painful.Finally we have a whole introduction to the life of Leah Rose Byrne and her family and friends including a dramatic back story of her missing sister all of which revolve around her examination of the dead girl's body...who turns out to not be her sister after all. I would have liked to have seen more of an outcome for her rather than a deep introduction to a character who has a minimal connection to the rest of the story.Closure that is what was missing from this movie.However this is not to say that the movie was BAD. You'll notice that I gave it an 8 out of 10star rating I thought the acting was fabulous the script wellwritten as far as character interaction and scene layout were concerned and the film beautifully shot and directed. It could have been a solid film of a dark but fascinating story about life and death and people and while it was all of these things the story was snipped neatly in half. All in all it was an original touching dark beautiful half of what could have been a masterpiece.The slogan to the movie is One life ends. Six others begin. Ultimately it felt that this was one film that ended...and within it six films that didn't.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Dead Pit 1989 VHS R  Directed by Brett Leonard An evil doctor that experiments on his mentally ill patients is entombed in the basement of an abandoned wing. 20 years later an amnesia patient known only as Jane Doe Cheryl Lawson arrives. An earthquake breaks the seal releasing the doctor to continue his dirty work. The dead patients also rise to wreck havoc.The biggest complaint I heard from other reviewers was about Lawson's acting ability which I do not think is that bad considering this is her first feature. She is not Scream Queen material though and would be better suited for a Lifetime movie. She won acting awards for this role and has since had a long career as a stunt woman. And why is she running around in her underwear? Not only would this be considered unethical treatment for patients but since when are bikini panties standard issue? She would be wearing granny undies. One size fits all This movie suspiciously looks a lot like Nightmare on Elm Street which was released 5 years prior to this. Our Jane Doe looks identical to Elm Street's heroine Nancy Thompson. And the scenes where she is running in a dreamlike state evading the evil man in her dreams But what really made me take notice was the scene where she is following her recently deceased friend only to be lead to Freddy uhhh.I mean the evil doctor.This venture was a bit disappointing for director Leonard Lawnmower Man Feed especially considering he cowrote the script. There are a few script problems that should have been tweaked during script rewrites. Why do the doctors and nurses speak to patients like best friends? If there is limited funding for this mental institute then why do they admit someone with amnesia and other minor illnesses? How likely is it that not one but two patients are snooping around and solving mysteries? The biggest problem is that I guessed the surprise ending early on in the film.And while the film touches on controversial subjects like performing illegal lobotomies on patients but never digs deep enough to leave a lasting impression on the viewer. There were a few scenes cut from the R rated version I watched such as an open brain surgery. Hopefully these scenes will be added in the upcoming DVD release.What stands out in the film are the top notch special effects provided by Ed Martinez. The zombies were the most exciting part of the movie although they come late at the 67 minute mark. You know the fun starts once the zombies emerge from the dead pit bald rotting and slimy. The patients later learn that a little bit of holy water goes a long way and we are treated to many melting faces.My favorite scene was toward the end when the good doctor played by the late Jeremy Slate walks down a hall hearing this disgusting gurgling choking noise. When he enters the bathroom it is covered with blood and the nurse walks towards him looking not so hot at the moment.Overall I think they didn't try hard enough in the first part of the movie. With 2 writers on board they should have been able to make a clever script with cool dialogue. They have a mental institution a nun amnesia zombies etc and they still struggled to make it interesting. Maybe they could have shown the orderlies and nurses being abusive towards the patients to make the first half of the film more dramatic and the zombies killing them in the second half bittersweet. Or why not add more religious themes since they had the nun patient blessing holy water? And if they insist on making Jane run around in panties then why not sleaze it up to make it more fun? There were several different directions this film could have gone but seemed to just tiptoe around the subjects instead of tackling them head on.Favorite Quote None. The dialogue was lackluster. And shamefully it wasn't even goofy enough to make me laugh.Extras This was the VHS version with no extras other than a few trailers at the beginning. It won The Best Video Box of the Year by Entertainment magazine when it was first released. A special DVD release is in the process now with SFX artist Ed Martinez providing commentary and SFX extras. Commentary has already been recorded with director Brett Leonard producer Gimel Everett and the late actor Jeremy Slate. See the Ed Martinez Interview with HorrorYearbook for details.To hear about the upcoming The Dead Pit DVD release and the unfortunate passing of actor Jeremy Slate read distributor Code Red's Blog here httpwww.codereddvd.comnublog.Bottom Line A must see for Leonard fans interested in his filmography. Has some noteworthy scenes but fails to be controversial or very scary.Rating 710 Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com".

	schema:reviewBody "It's fair to say I've earned my stripes in regard to zombie movies. Through the course I've taken to delve deep into horror I've seen countless titles given the highest honors to the lowest scumofthe earth production values cinema has ever witnessed. From A to Z grade however there stands a few shining stars that are worth discussing. The Dead Pit is one of these last glimmers of hope. Brett Leonard the man responsible for both writing and directing 1992's The Lawnmower Man made his directorial debut with this undead feature he did a fine job in presenting it.The story begins at a mental hospital in California. Dr. Ramzi a deranged doctor at the facility has been murdering and experimenting on patients in the basement. Dr. Gerald Swan learns of his sinister activities in fear of jeopardizing his career at the hospital he decides to eliminate Dr. Ramzi and bury the truth for 20 years. Jane Doe an unidentified woman suffering from amnesia is admitted to the facility. After an earthquake occurs visions allow her to slowly uncover the dark secret buried deep beneath.This movie seems to function greatly for a variety of reasons. Although a few typical 80s production clichs exist they all seem to apply perfectly in the given scenarios the plot uncovers  the use of smoke machines in correlation with intense back lighting are exhausted thoroughly. The bumbling policemen standing outside discussing donuts was also a nice touch. I expect certain predictable elements to exist within the era I'm experiencing. It all works tremendously. The vacant hospital wings that were chosen as set pieces for this film are outstanding. The director clearly knew what he was doing as a viewer I felt isolated. The cast of actorsactresses hired to fill the character roles did a decent job  certainly no Emmy nominations to be had but a solid enough attempt in their own right. As far as the musical score is concerned expect typical 80s offbeat harmonics  which in my opinion is what I look forward to. Clearly anything with a dark melody is par for the course.This film can be classified as a zombie flick but it requires a bit of patience from the viewer. The pace seems sluggish for the first 40 minutes of the film but picks up nicely. There is plenty of violence and gore to satiate the blood thirst of any gore hound. The special effects and makeup are worth noting. Although I reserve a special pedestal for Tom Savini the artists responsible for The Dead Pit are truly remarkable and come in a close second  their work displayed here is even a few notches down from  in my humble opinion the greatest zombie masterpiece of all time George A. Romero's 1985 feature Day of the Dead. I consider this a true accomplishment many Z grade zombie flicks from the 80s primarily ones with an Italianschlock quality I'm not including Lucio Fulci when I speak of schlock so please don't send a lynch mob to my doorstep! fail miserably in achieving the same success. When it comes to zombie movies in general I think most could agree that Romero was responsible for reinventing and trendsetting a particular brand of undead fiend in 1968's Night of the Living Dead. I don't consider it a crime if his influence is shared by directors and production teams alike. Although not in the top 5 of classic zombie re tellings The Dead Pit surely makes the top 10  give it a try and you won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "If anyone s checked my list of writeups you'll see that mostly I tend to review slashers. The Dead Pitt isn't exactly one of those flicks but for a fair part of the runtime it incorporates some of the genre's defining elements. There's a psychopathic surgical masked serial killer that has the trademark heavy breath and only the heroine can see him Halloween. And some similar themed stalking set pieces and fairly gruesome murders Just about every slasher that's ever been released!. It's like an insane mix of Exquisite Tenderness Dawn of the Mummy and strangely enough The Exorcist! But overall it's a zombie movie alas it's an original one with an exquisite surrounding for the plot to unravel in! I suppose the question that you really want answered if you're reading this is  is it any good?In the beginning Jane Doe is admitted to the State Mental asylum sorry but they don't give us the name with amnesia. She protests that she hasn't lost her memory but it was in fact stolen from her!  Her arrival spells bad news for the other inmates however when an earthquake rocks the institution. Soon after everyone starts freaking out and people begin to disappear although Jane knows that they have been brutally murdered. She begins seeing a deranged looking surgeon with a bullet hole in his head hanging around the complex but noone else spots him and the nurses assume that it's just her insanity creating illusions. Dr. Swann tries her under hypnotherapy which provides some shocking if a little unexpected results! The only person that does listen to her is Christian a patient that becomes close friends with the distraught female. The two set out to solve the mystery of the bizarre disappearances unaware of the evil that's growing in the clock tower opposite them!This was Cheryl Lawson's first movie and impressively she managed to land herself the lead part. I can't understand why though she's one of the worst actresses that I've ever seen! She spends most of the runtime in a tight Tshirt obviously without a bra I mean come on! and small knickers. That's great for us because she's licklippingly gorgeous and exceptionally well endowed but it's pretty unflattering for any female to have to dress like that more than once in her movie debut. Tight clothes and good looks are still no substitute for talent and sadly watching her unconvingly wine and warble her way through the script can become almost nauseating at times! The rest of the cast is equally unimpressive and the only real stars' are the extras that play the deluded inmates of the asylum. Some of the portrayals of dementia are fairly conclusive and add a welcome feeling of uneasiness to the proceedings.       Director Brett Leonard didn't disappear after this like the myriad of other horror helmers from the eighties. Instead he managed to climb on to better things most noticeably Lawnmower Man. It's obvious from his experimental photography that he could indeed handle his place in the hot seat' although at times he struggles to create suspense when it felt like it was most needed. He also cowrote the screenplay which somewhat lowers his credibility because it has more holes than a keepnet! For example How did a doctor that was locked in a basement with a bullet in his head manage to find the time to erase Jane's memory? How can he be dead for twentyone years and only rot slightly? How did the zombies manage to take the distributor caps from the car engines to prevent escape aren't they supposed to be the walking DEAD? And most importantly were they deliberately aiming for paroxysms of laughter with their method for stopping the hordes of zombies? It has to be seen to be believed! Answers on a postcard please The Dead Pitt is essentially a patchwork of a movie and not just because it attempts to be a successful crossbreed of horror subgenres. The excellent lighting that is evident in the opening scenes seems to inexplicably evade the rest of the movie. The plot seems to crumble from imaginative to downright inept and it flies back and fourth from sluggish to energetic throughout. Surprisingly enough the BBFC  who were at their strictest in the eighties  were implausibly lenient when they gave this an 18 certificate they left an astonishing amount of gore unedited and the story benefits from it's presence.      A claustrophobic and affectively eerie atmosphere is created at times. But there are far too many ideas fighting for attention which leaves the best of them struggling to be realised. Huge potential that should have been further developed is sadly wasted by the film's attempt to be a Jack of all trades. There are a few redeeming features that prevent it from complete failure but ultimately far too much has been crammed into far too little. It is indeed a shame but what could have been a benchmark in horror history is unforgivably flawed.".

	schema:headline " Great late '80 zombie flick...";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw The Dead Pit first time some 15 years ago and since late at night on television. I couldn't remember the title until few years ago and recently I manage to find it on DVD.Surprisingly magic is still there. Without getting too much into plot movie is about doctor who performs illegal brain surgeries until his college kills him for moral reasons sealing him into his Dead Pit. Twenty years after Jane Doe girl who lost her memories comes into the very same hospital. Soon after earthquake crack the wall of Dead Pit and good old doctor comes back to life unleashing his horde of undead.I don't know why many people complain about this movie seems they are forgetting that this is '80 low budget movie times when literally everything you thought of could be put on screen. It's a descent '80 zombie flick bit unusual because of it's narrative style and nightmarish atmosphere it has. It was a first feature of now well known director Brett Leonard who manage to capture otherworldly atmosphere in what is now considered cult classic. His obvious influences are Wes Craven and his Elm Street director acknowledged this in audio commentary for Dead Pit DVD. Story gets bit spread here and there but it never gets too confusing nor it tries to be more then it actually is  a low budget horror flick.Altho movie starts bit slow but it has some nice scenes to keep you interested for the first half of the movie it really comes to life in second half when all hell breaks lose and zombies start to rampage through asylum. Characters aren't deeply developed but they are interesting enough to keep you watching at screen good looking Cheryl Lawson helps in that department. Did I mention she walks around in her underwear most of the time?SF goes from terrific to silly but most of the time they are looking quite good especially when it comes to gore scenes. It's bloody and will satisfy every zombie fan because FX here have all the necessary requirement for good zombie gorefest. Highlight of this little flick are cinematography which was really well done and music score which goes from moody to creepy. Cheryl Lawson looks are also big highlight of this movie.Bad Some scenes are bit longer then they should be some plot elements that aren't really needed and bit corny ending and innovative way of killing zombies that might cause laugh for hardcore zombie fans.Overall it's a descent flick worth checking out if you are fan of horror movies and for some reason you haven't seen it already.".

The main character in the movie Jane Doe is played by Cheryl Lawson and I think she does an excellent job of overdramatic but not bad acting. Especially when she freaks out or is being hypnotized by the doctor.  Not a whole lot of gore but a lot of really cool looking zombies out for brains. Basically a hopelessly zoned out woman is stalked by an undead doctor at a mental institution.  Very creeped out music. I love this movie so much I gave it a 10excellent.  The box for the movie has a zombie on the cover with little light bulbs for his eyes.  When you press a button the eyes start blinking!  Way over the top movie.  The only other zombie movie better than this that I have seen so far is DEAD ALIVE. See this movie ASAP!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not going to be a surprise but here we have yet another horror movie that had potential but in the end just cannot deliver all the goods. It has a semi decent story but there are to many plot holes and unanswered questions. There are zombies in the movie however for the most part they are confined to the end. The movie also feels longer than its hour and a half runtime. I mean I just watched the movie Inferno and according to its runtime it is over ten minutes longer but it felt a lot shorter. To the story it starts out with a confrontation between two doctors at the dead pit of the title. One of the doctors is a tad insane and seemingly doing random experiments with the patients at this insane asylum. Well the one doctor shoots this doctor and instead of reporting the happenings to the authorities he seals the now dead crazy doctor in the basement of this building and you are thinking why didn't he go to the police? Because if he did there would not be much of a movie now would there silly. Flash years later and the place is running again and a new patient who is calling herself Jane Doe because of memory loss seems to spark a return of our good doctor from the basement. He is soon out beginning his experiments again with his sights set on revenge of the man who killed him. So that is how the movie progresses for a bit there I was worried there would not be much time for the zombie attack at the end and that it would be just a small pointless scene however I just think the rest of the movie dragged to much because the zombie scene at the end is a bit good. On the whole if this movie was just paced better and they got to the zombies quicker it would have been better but as it is it is a not all that bad not all that good movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hell.. I have watched scores of horror films of all genres liked many and trashed quite a few in this very portal. All said and done this too is a '80s style horror film with gore campy effects shambling zombies evil doctors halfnaked females scary hospitals and whatnot. There are loopholes aplenty but can we really expect logic in a horror film? They are there for our entertainment  love them or leave them.In this film the hospital scenes are satisfyingly eerie the nurses and orderlies expectedly intimidating and the lead female Cheryl Lawson attractive enough. Amazingly in the apparently high security asylum male and female patients freely intermingle and even visit each others rooms. Wow.. now that creates certain possibilities  Cheryl is endowed with a delicious figure and attractive good looks.. plus she runs around the corridors at night wearing bikinicut panties and a short slip. Yummy! Amazingly neither IMDb nor Wikipedia have any info on Cheryl till date. Seems a pity considering that she carried the entire film on her.. umm.. shoulders?I am kidding.Watchable for the antics of Cheryl the evil doctor and the creepy hospital building if nothing else. The idea of drenching zombies with holy water seems to be a novel one.

	onyx:emotionText "Hell.. I have watched scores of horror films of all genres liked many and trashed quite a few in this very portal. All said and done this too is a '80s style horror film with gore campy effects shambling zombies evil doctors halfnaked females scary hospitals and whatnot. There are loopholes aplenty but can we really expect logic in a horror film? They are there for our entertainment  love them or leave them.In this film the hospital scenes are satisfyingly eerie the nurses and orderlies expectedly intimidating and the lead female Cheryl Lawson attractive enough. Amazingly in the apparently high security asylum male and female patients freely intermingle and even visit each others rooms. Wow.. now that creates certain possibilities  Cheryl is endowed with a delicious figure and attractive good looks.. plus she runs around the corridors at night wearing bikinicut panties and a short slip. Yummy! Amazingly neither IMDb nor Wikipedia have any info on Cheryl till date. Seems a pity considering that she carried the entire film on her.. umm.. shoulders?I am kidding.Watchable for the antics of Cheryl the evil doctor and the creepy hospital building if nothing else. The idea of drenching zombies with holy water seems to be a novel one. Usually they appear to be indestructible..Postscript Can anybody explain to me why Hollywood zombies always want to attack and eat living humans? I mean whats the logic behind it? Oh Jesus.. again I am searching for logic.. how stupid of me ";

She also spends half the running time running around in her underwear. The emphasis however is on the bloodshed and it flows quite freely here.

One of the main reasons for that is the rather great story to this as there's much more to this one than what's expected. The fact that it throws in much more than normal from the nightmarish dreams to the therapy sessions and her connection to the doctor's past through the flash visions that pop up this one does manage to stay interesting for the seemingly disparate story elements are nicely woven together into a rich story that has a lot of twists and turns to keep it going. When it hits the second half there's as much goodness from the action as the first half which includes the zombie massacre on the staff and patients that offers up some great moments and there's also the big scenes in the basement of the facility where all the zombies are kept and operated on. There's also the greatness of the finale where the film goes for a larger scale than expected and really makes this fun as there's some solid chasing around the abandoned buildings as well as the complete destruction of a water tower and the resulting flood it unleashes manages to employ some nice action into the proceedings to make it come to an end. The other really big part of this is that there's so much bloodshed in the film. This is incredibly bloody packed with loads of gore and messy features as there's literally no end to the ripped off limbs a lobotomy pick through the eyes scores of decapitations brain surgeries and really great gunshots to the head. Even the dead are bloody full of wounds all slimy and bloodstreaked many of them bald in spotted and mildewed hospital gowns as they shuffle and stutter their way to wreak havoc. There are many great scenes of them coming for the main characters lit from behind in an awesome setting which just makes them that much more impressivelooking. Alongside the mental hospital setting which is completely creepy offers up some unnerving atmosphere and just gives the whole thing a really uneasy feeling these here are what make the film worthwhile as it doesn't have a whole lot of flaws to it. The main one is that the plot is rather hard to get into. There's a lot of things going on in here from the amnesia victim to the past relationship that's remained hidden and the rather clichd manner in which it all manages to occur at the end and while all of these make the film feel smart trying to piece together the way it all unfolds is just plain exhausting. Worse is the whole clich spook of the main character that can only see the main villain's ridiculous vanishing act ploy as there's not a lot of them but what they lack in number they make up for in groaning ability. Otherwise there isn't much wrong with this one.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.".

	schema:headline " The Dead Pit";
	schema:reviewBody "If you were a kid cruising the shelves of the video store throughout the horror section I'm sure you came across the interactive video box of Brett Leonard's THE DEAD PIT with the ghoul rising from a pit a button you could push that made the fiend's eyes glow..those days were so cool because distributors put effort in their releases finding innovative ways to market their products for the home video crowd. I never rented the movie at the time but thanks to the fine folks at Code Red I was finally able to sit and watch THE DEAD PIT provided uncut and in a proper transfer.The storyline is beyond bonkers and bizarre regarding this evil neurosurgeon..based on the haunted recollections of director Leonard who based this guy on a neurosurgeon who was his mother's doctor..his mom had brain cancerwho was shot point blank in the forehead by his colleague Dr. Gerald SwanJeremy Slatebecause of his diabolical transorbital lobotomies on asylum patients. Swan boards up the secret area where these procedures took place..featuring a pit where the bodies of the dead patients were storedalong with the neurosurgeon's body and moves on with his life burying the past away..that is until a new patient is brought to his institution twenty years later an amnesiac Jane DoeCheryl Lawsonwho might just have some kind of connection with the dead neurosurgeon. An earthquake of heavy magnitude opens the boarded secret room and the neurosurgeon rises from his pit to gather up new victims nurses and patients of Swan's while also terrorizing Jane in the process. Jane befriends a relatively sane patient Chris MeyersStephen Gregory Foster in the institution as punishment for his activities as a dangerous bomb expert! Funny how this unique ability will come in handy at a later point in the film! While the killer neurosurgeon ghoul moves across the grounds at night collecting his new victims Swan attempts to unlock the repressed memories of Jane to establish just who she is and how she might relate to RamziDanny Gocknauer explaining to us why this menacing bastard haunts her so.I think THE DEAD PIT achieves in certain areas while it suffers in others..despite an incoherent plot and many gaping holes Brett Leonard's debut feature has very impressive makeup  prosthetic effects with stunning camera work..photographed by Marty Collins  striking use of color and light..blue and green in particular. When it becomes a certified zombie film with past patients of Ramzi's rising from the greenglowing pit bloodsoaked many featuring open wounds THE DEAD PIT is sure to win the hearts of undead genre fans everywhere. These zombies are the things of nightmares and the way they are shot using back light which introduces them often in the form of shadowed silhouettes accompanied by misty fog marching towards potential victims is quite visually arresting. The interesting marriage of asylum and zombie genres enhances THE DEAD PIT I believe and the setting of a former mental institution Agnews Developmental Center..certain areas falling apart while the more sound buildings produce just as much disturbing ambianceprovides a really spooky aesthetic that should be pleasing to the eyes of horror fans. Cheryl Lawson as Jane Doe services the movie as major eye candy a short Tshirt and panties her wardrobe for most of the screen time. Some phenomenally gruesome gore..it's a testament to the fx wizards to achieve such work under the tight budgetary constraints includes heads opened revealing brains..including one nifty sequence where Ramzi uses needles to purposely cause certain sensations to a victim inserting them into an exposed brain while also jamming picks into faces causing immediate lobotomy right on the spot surprising certain victims who were caught offguard by the demented psychopath. There are also some really cool melting effects..always a major plus to mefeaturing faces deteriorating into skeletal remains. Ramzi's glowing red eyes are a bit too much perhaps eliciting unintentional laughs instead of fright and throughout the forehead bullet hole remains an eyesore  distraction. And the inclusion of blessed holy water as a means to possibly defeat Ramzi is a bit goofy particularly when the one blessing it is a patient pretending to be a nun! Still as a low budget shocker I think THE DEAD PIT is a success and has much to offer horror fans who can drown out the film's many deficiencies appreciating the atmosphere and wicked visceral aspects.".

I never rented the movie at the time but thanks to the fine folks at Code Red I was finally able to sit and watch THE DEAD PIT provided uncut and in a proper transfer.The storyline is beyond bonkers and bizarre regarding this evil neurosurgeon..based on the haunted recollections of director Leonard who based this guy on a neurosurgeon who was his mother's doctor..his mom had brain cancerwho was shot point blank in the forehead by his colleague Dr. Gerald SwanJeremy Slatebecause of his diabolical transorbital lobotomies on asylum patients. Swan boards up the secret area where these procedures took place..featuring a pit where the bodies of the dead patients were storedalong with the neurosurgeon's body and moves on with his life burying the past away..that is until a new patient is brought to his institution twenty years later an amnesiac Jane DoeCheryl Lawsonwho might just have some kind of connection with the dead neurosurgeon. An earthquake of heavy magnitude opens the boarded secret room and the neurosurgeon rises from his pit to gather up new victims nurses and patients of Swan's while also terrorizing Jane in the process. Jane befriends a relatively sane patient Chris MeyersStephen Gregory Foster in the institution as punishment for his activities as a dangerous bomb expert! Funny how this unique ability will come in handy at a later point in the film! While the killer neurosurgeon ghoul moves across the grounds at night collecting his new victims Swan attempts to unlock the repressed memories of Jane to establish just who she is and how she might relate to RamziDanny Gocknauer explaining to us why this menacing bastard haunts her so.I think THE DEAD PIT achieves in certain areas while it suffers in others..despite an incoherent plot and many gaping holes Brett Leonard's debut feature has very impressive makeup  prosthetic effects with stunning camera work..photographed by Marty Collins  striking use of color and light..blue and green in particular. When it becomes a certified zombie film with past patients of Ramzi's rising from the greenglowing pit bloodsoaked many featuring open wounds THE DEAD PIT is sure to win the hearts of undead genre fans everywhere. These zombies are the things of nightmares and the way they are shot using back light which introduces them often in the form of shadowed silhouettes accompanied by misty fog marching towards potential victims is quite visually arresting. The interesting marriage of asylum and zombie genres enhances THE DEAD PIT I believe and the setting of a former mental institution Agnews Developmental Center..certain areas falling apart while the more sound buildings produce just as much disturbing ambianceprovides a really spooky aesthetic that should be pleasing to the eyes of horror fans. Cheryl Lawson as Jane Doe services the movie as major eye candy a short Tshirt and panties her wardrobe for most of the screen time. Some phenomenally gruesome gore..it's a testament to the fx wizards to achieve such work under the tight budgetary constraints includes heads opened revealing brains..including one nifty sequence where Ramzi uses needles to purposely cause certain sensations to a victim inserting them into an exposed brain while also jamming picks into faces causing immediate lobotomy right on the spot surprising certain victims who were caught offguard by the demented psychopath. There are also some really cool melting effects..always a major plus to mefeaturing faces deteriorating into skeletal remains. Ramzi's glowing red eyes are a bit too much perhaps eliciting unintentional laughs instead of fright and throughout the forehead bullet hole remains an eyesore  distraction. And the inclusion of blessed holy water as a means to possibly defeat Ramzi is a bit goofy particularly when the one blessing it is a patient pretending to be a nun! Still as a low budget shocker I think THE DEAD PIT is a success and has much to offer horror fans who can drown out the film's many deficiencies appreciating the atmosphere and wicked visceral aspects.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Dead Pit offers a grim  chilling atmosphere sublime settings and some of the most exhilarating gore effects I've ever seen and yet... it's all ruined by truly amateurish production values and incompetent acting performances. What a crying shame as Brett Leonard's Feed Hideaway debut easily could have been one of the late 80's most grueling horror accomplishments with its disturbingly gloom psychiatric clinic setting and the fairly unique 'zombifying' process that involves scalping people and sticking needles in their exposed brains. When you watch many independent lowbudget horror flicks you tend to get used to bad acting and lousy editing jobs but it becomes a lot more difficult to overlook when the story actually has such great potential. Then you're just left behind with feelings of disappointment and anger. This film would have been a lot better if everyone  with the exception of Jeremy Slate  just kept their mouths shut and focused more on the bloodsoaked zombies that come crawling out of the eerie pit in the asylum's secret basement. The living dead are experiment cases of the gifted Dr. Colin Ramzi who went a little ballistic in his search for discovering the medical causes of insanity. His former partner Dr. Swan killed him and walled him up underneath the asylum but now twenty years later the arrival of a mysteriously amnesic girl and a heavy earthquake brought him back and he's more satanic than he ever was. The plot makes no sense and it's full of holes but it's a really creepy film that features absolutely no comic reliefs or sympathetic characters. The good characters like the innocent young nurse are slaughtered just as relentlessly as the wicked ones and you shouldn't root for a happy ending either! The odd music contributes to the unsettling atmosphere as well and that abandoned dark hospital building is honestly one of the creepiest horror setting in history. One sequence in particular when Dr. Ramzi is standing over the pit with his arms spread whilst an army of undead souls emerges is vintage 80's terror in my humble opinion. But now let's rant a little about the negative elements. They show right away with the ineptly edited opening credits! The whole history between Dr. Swan and Dr. Ramzi gets constantly intercut with credits which looks very amateurish and overly interrupts the pace. The clumsy editing remains the main problem throughout the entire film as relocations are always indicated by stagnant images of a full moon. That one same shot of the moon must feature in the film for a total of 15 times or something. Most of the acting performances are just hopeless especially Stephen Foster as the heroic male lead and Danny Gochnauer as the malicious flashy redeyed zombie doctor. His character should have just been a silent one. Cheryl Lawson isn't the world's greatest actress neither but at least she looks nice and walks around scarcely dressed most of the time. Those are very nice undies you're wearing Cheryl... And a sexy top too!".

This movie is way better than 90 of the crap that comes out today. The acting is also superb and I think it Chris Tucker's greatest performance. Even though the story has a lot of action it's very believable which is hard to do in Hollywood. For those who haven't seen this movie I suggest you go and rent it now it's a modern day classic. Sit back and be prepared to watch a great moment in filmaking. It's definitely underrated. I think if it was promoted better it might have done better especially since most war movies do well.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hughes Brothers tried to play up the same angle with Dead Presidents as Micheal Cimino and Louis Garfinkle did with The Deer Hunter by portraying the social effects that the Vietnam war had on its young veterans.  And for a while it seemed as though they were quite successful. But in the end it became apparent why The Dead Presidents fell short of the Academy recognition that The Deer Hunter won.Set in the late 60s and early 70s the plotline of Dead Presidents follows a promising and popular innercity high school graduate Anthony Curtis Larenz Tate who decides to forego college and enter the Vietnam War as a member of the Marine Corps.  Anthony survives a graphic and arduous threeplusyear stint in the jungle but upon his homecoming he realizes that the real world can be just as trying as war.  His lowpaying job provides little support for his new family and he becomes desperate to make ends meet.  He enlists the help of some old friends and plans a daring armored car heist which if successful could serve to amend his past and brighten his future...The first seventyfive minutes of this movie were really well done. Character traits and relationships were wellestablished and the mood was properly set as suspense built for the anticipated war scenesa perfect epiccaliber introduction.But instead of continuing with a detailed flow the directing crew tried to cram about ninety minutes worth of material into the final fortyfive minutes and consequently did not leave themselves enough time to totally develop any strong climactic progression or aptly characterize any of the cast members into their sudden postwar criminal complex.  Thus the heist scene which based on advertising was probably supposed to be one of the more memorable and authoritative parts of the film seemed to be almost too spurofthemoment and lacked motivation and definition.All in all the film's running time which was approximately 119 minutes was simply far too short for the storyline.  The postwar segment of the film the last fortyfive minutes was indeed key in separating a decent movie like Dead Presidents from a epic masterpiece like The Deer Hunter.Besides the first seventyfive minutes a couple of notably good performances given by Chris Tucker as Skip Anthony's best friend and Rose Jackson as Juanita Anthony's girlfriend do make Dead Presidents a movie worth seeing at least once.  That said I would warn not to create a preconception based on the title tagline or any publicity images that you might have seen because they apply only to a small portion of the action.".

The heist doesn't happen and isn't even an issue until late in the film. Up to that point you could consider this a life in the ghetto movie trying to escape the ghetto movie a Viet Nam war movie a what life was like for blacks in the late 60's early 70's movie a what the Viet Nam war did to those who survived it movie so on and so on.

Larenz Tate in his best role ever plays Anthony Curtis a young black man from late 1960's The Bronx who is just a regular guy who hangs out with his friends played by Chris Tucker also in his best role ever as Skip and Freddy Rodriguez as Jose. Shortly after graduation from high school Anthony decides he doesn't want to follow his big brother's path of going to college but instead joining the Marine Corps and fight for his country. Shortly thereafter we are taken to Vietnam with the boys and we meet some other interesting characters one of them a psychotic preacher Cleon played by Bokeem Woodbineand the Vietnam sequences are executed very realistically and are very bloody. After a while we are taken back to the boogie down Bronx where Anthony upon returning to the old neighborhood after four yearsrealizes that things are even worse than before and everyone including his preVietnam girlfriend Juanita all have taken their lives in a different direction. Anthony is now a father and cannot find a job anywhere and realizes that his own country has turned his back on him and many young black veterans from 'Nam including his old boys Skip and Jose. We also meet Kirby played by Keith David a once cold and ruthless hustler who has now left the life because the corruption of the city has forced him to quit his old habits and Juanita's sister Delilah played by N'Bushe Wright who is an activist with the Black Panthers. Pretty soon all of these characters save Juanita fed up with their lives and their situation get together to plan a stickup on an armored truck that is making a pickup of old dollar bills and is taking them to a location in Washington to burn them. The stickup sequence is very well made but of course bloody. This movie is filled with great performances the best coming from Larenz Tate Bokeem Woodbine and Keith David heartpounding action and good dialogue. A Hughes Brothers' classic. 9.5 out of 10.".

Indeed observant viewers will note the explicit bloodshed that's prevalent in Dead Presidents as being homage to the graphic gangster pictures of yesteryear and that doesn't make it bad.Presidents takes a look at the role that the color green played in the lives young black men before and after Vietnam. In fact on the killing fields of good old 'Nam mankind is seen at its absolute lowest where soldiers on both sides of the conflict commit horrific atrocities including a scene where a black soldier decapitates a dead Viet Cong and keeps the head for good luck or when an American soldier is gutted and castrated.Obviously the Hughes Brothers have some real big qualms about black mens' involvement in that conflict and the film's central character Anthony Curtis Larenz Tate finds little prospects awaiting him in the Bronx after doing two tours in Vietnam.Before he left however he'd impregnated his girlfriend Juanita Rose Jackson and while in country he doesn't permit himself to think of what he's left behind in America. So when Anthony's forced to leave his lowpaying job as a meat cutter it's not a surprise that he's already begun plans to knock off an armored truck to get some dead presidents which is street slang for dollar bills.So together with his two involuntarily enlisted Vietnam buddies Skip Chris Tucker and Jose Freddy Rodriguez Anthony's Uncle Kirby Keith David Juanita's radicalized sister Delilah N'Bushe Wright and Cleon Bokeem Woodbine they proceed to knock over the truck and make way with its valuable assets.The film is most definitely a gritty look at the black experience during the Civil Rights era and the Hughes Brothers certainly pay a lot more attention to the details of the picture. It's not better than Menace but is certainly bettermade now that they have been given a more reasonable budget.1010".

Needing a focus in life Anthony finds himself being drawn in to a life of crime DEAD PRESIDENTS was released in 1995 with a fair amount of hype . Directed by the Hughes brothers it was marketed as a film that marketed the black experience of coming home after Vietnam . One can understand why the film was marketed this way since the Hughes did make the critically acclaimed MENACE II SOCIETY  part of a short lived but acclaimed  Ghetto subgenre  in the early 1990s . DEAD PRESIDENTS might try to fit in to this type of genre but what ever type of movie it's trying to be it fails because there's an obvious flaw  there's not one single likable character in the movie If the Hughes brothers had been white I'm sure they'd have been accused of playing up to ethnic stereotypes or at the very least making a blacksplotation movie twenty years too late . The film starts with some foul mouthed characters lamenting the lack of sex in their lives and goes downhill from there . The film then cuts to Vietnam and if Anthnoy  And the audience  thought the ghetto was bad then Vietnam is a lot worse . The war scenes are genuinely disturbing and violent but again this seems very old hat when we'd already had a glut of antiwar films featuring the 'Nam ten years earlier and most of them making an antiwar point much better too . When Anthony returns to America he gets involved in a robbery that makes the Vietnam war look like an episode of TELETUBBIES This is a muddled  unfocused violent film that becomes more and more depressing as it goes along . If the Hughes are making a comment that returning soldiers from conflicts regardless of their colour are callously ignored by the country they fought to defend then they have failed . There's little incitement for the characters to become the violent ruthless criminals they are . Just because an educated college boy fought in a war zone it never seems a convincing character motivation to become a criminal  and the robbery itself on an armoured car is done so graphically and violently is enough to evaporate any potential sympathy one might have had at Anthony's plight Despite being a competently made film  the editing is very good for example  DEAD PRESIDENTS is a classic example of a film having to elicit empathy from the audience and if it fails to do this then the entire film fails".

Then I saw Dead Presidents and I saw they took it up a notch.  This film is set in Harlem in the mid 60's a young man named Anthony Curtis who's unsure of what to do with this life after high school and is not really interested in the usual route of college.  He decides to enlist in the Marine Corps and no doubt ends up in Vietnam in a special armed forces unit.  Although he makes it out alive unscratched after four years of service he returns home to find himself his Marine buddies and their families  including his own new growing family  ravaged physically emotionally psychologically and economically by the war.  When things seem to really go bleak Anthony and his friends decide to rob an armored bank truck to get themselves back on track.Dead Presidents confirms the suspicions that were aroused by Menace that the Hughes Brothers are without question going to become master filmmakers. There is an obvious graduation in their skills here look at the brilliant way they segue into Vietnam by showing Anthony hop over backyard fences with dogs barking in the background that suddenly fade into shotgun blasts and officer commands then with one pass over another fence Anthony is suddenly is Vietnam blasting his shotgun.  Be warned the Vietnam sequence in the film contains the most grotesque war scenes ever filmed much more brief in length than Saving Private Ryan but just as intense.Larenz Tate gives a strong performance as a man with a dogood heart but a warped mind that's been tarnished by war.  Keith David is also skilled as Kirby the neighborhood elder who serves as Anthony's mentor.  N'Bushe Wright is miscast as a Black militant activist who entices Anthony towards the heist she's a really bad actress and the Hughes Brothers were smart for cutting her screen time.  Dead Presidents speaks volume about Black Americans' involvement in Vietnam and the consequences they suffered for doing so.  Not a happy film but an honest and skillful one.".

It's about a man who could have gone to college but goes to fight in the Vietnam War a white man's war and his experiences in that war and after that war. Somehow this does not sound bad right? But it is not good my friends. I really could not get into the story and the characters maybe that's my fault But one thing I really missed here was suspense well worked out characters and stuff. All this film had was a lot of blood. Not recommended if you want to see a good film about war.

So expectations were high but when the credits rolled on at the end I wondered what on earth was so special about the film.The plot was predictable and with so many short scenes there was little time for atmosphere which left the funk and soul heavy sound track to work overtime. I would align this film with Forest Gump in its attempts to show a young man growing up. Weaving adolescence romance violence and adventure into the story. This is the most slight reference since the two films qualities are markedly different.Not a single character in Dead Presidents incites any reaction from the audience. The scripts plausibility is questionable in many places chasms of time are treated as though they have been emotionally filled in. Characters act out their two dimensional emotions towards these situations to move seamlessly onwards.If you feel sympathy for the lead character to begin with once it is revealed he comes from a loving supportive family this is quashed. I don't think you can identify with a character who throws away so much due to arrogance and selfish pride. So if this is the case what where the directors trying to say about this mans life? Nothing in the film allowed us to be enlightened.I wouldn't recommend this film but then I like films which have a depth and are written in a more considered way.".

And not to mention Larenz Tate whose boyishlylooking features cleanly established the groundwork in the development of the story. And although a lot of profanity was employed in this movie it does capture the gravity of what the story hoped to convey.The movie is so vivid and compelling I believe that this account was based on reality than that of imagination or fiction. Kudos to the Hughes bros. who've once again given us yet another thought provoking glimpse of life from another perspective.Wishful thinking Beginning with the lives of the principal actors when they first met as children.Memorable movie quote Fuck you man.

Its clearly a low budget movie with very DV like cinematography and average acting. The plot has some nice ideas but the photographer who is obsessed with dead girls Peeping Tom anyone? is not that new and the psychological background story is pretty week. So you can mainly give credit for the idea of getting rid of the body and the closing scene. Most of the film is damn slow and obviously Dead still tries to be a psychological thriller with some ghost elements thrown in. But the story barely seems consistent and what seems to be threads cleverly interweaved is a mess on second view. What makes he movie especially suffer is that its shot mainly in the studio of the photographer which is an old abandoned factory and its a pretty ridiculous setting which tries to give some ghost scares but is really boring for this slow movie. So don't fall for it... this movie is barely creepy except for one sequence you can already see on the DVD Cover ... for an indie thriller you can give it a shot if you don't mind cheap production but really...

I sat down expecting to find a that sleeper gem we all hope to find but instead just got another low budgetput me to sleeper. Where was the scary stuff? A few animated corpses that did? or didn't? exist really don't qualify as scary to me. The story had some potential but was stifled bad acting boring and limited use of shooting locations and when it was all done it really was just a by the book rubber stamped horrorwhich I have no problem with whatsoever if all the other variables are right. In Ghost of the Needle those variable weren't right though and it oozed low budget which generally makes for a poor horror.Unless you're an independent film nut or just have an adventurous taste in films avoid this one. Even if you feel like gambling some time on it don't waste a weekend night for it. Watch it while folding laundry on Tuesday night or listen to it while doing dishes Thursday night etc I watched Ghost of the Needle on DVD. The quality was fine and although you can pick one of many reasons not to watch this movie one reason can't be because of how it will look on your screen".

	schema:headline " Compelling Suspence Yarn";
	schema:reviewBody "Ghost of the Needle is the compelling and taunt story of Jacob Brian AvenetBradley a talented photographer who enjoys injecting young women with drugs and then photographing their dead bodies.  His agent Richard Greg Thompson is frustrated that Jacob won't sell any of his work even after a nice commission to photograph a bridge at a particular time of day.Jacob manages to find a new girl Aimee Cheri Christian while photographing the bridge.  But after this murder funny things start to occur in Jacob's studio.I'd say more but that would just ruin the experience of viewing this incredible piece of cinema.The film is directed and edited with confidence by AvenetBradley and shot with skill by his wife Laurence AvenetBradley.  No shot is superfluous or poorly staged.  The script done by AvenetBradley is a refreshing one choosing to center on the killer as the primary character.It's interesting that Jacob almost becomes the sympathetic hero of the film as AvenetBradley surrounds Jacob with unlikable people including his slimy agent a nasty detectivebounty hunter Kevin Bartolomucci and Steve the wealthy man Jack Harkleroad who is commissioning Jacob to photograph the bridge.  The only truly likable person Jacob meets is Laura Leigh Hill Steve's wife.None of these people have done anything wrong or even given you a reason not to like them and yet I found myself viewing Jacob the most likable fellow despite the fact that he's serial killer.  It's a refreshing shift from having the strong hero battling the interesting psycho to focusing only on how the killer is viewing this world around him.AvenetBradley's Jacob is a sullen and nearly emotionless man.  It works. It's technical Jacob says early on.  And it is.  The film makes a point of showing the audience just how methodical Jacob is in his photography with a wonderfully done sequence of photo development by hand Reminded me of One Hour Photo's explanation of how of onehour places do your snapshots.  The victims are picked purely by chance.  Jacob then goes through the process of propping them up photographing them and the developing and framing the pictures.  The method has meaning for him not so much the result.Thompson's Richard is a very Hollywoodish agent all smiles with customers slave driver with Jacob.  His line delivery is deadon and wonderful injecting deadpan humor into a very serious unfunny film.The real gem is Leigh Hill as Laura.  I was a bit iffy concerning the performance when Laura first appears but by the end I was sold on Hill. She plays Laura with serious innerstrength and a quiet loving power that nicely balances Jacob's technical methodicalness.I'm not a person that gets scared at films that have tons of blood lots of gore etc.  I'm more about atmosphere and creating an air of suspense and danger.  Ghost of the Needle does a fine job of doing these things. Laurence AvenetBradley's camera work goes a long way to achieving this by weaving in and out of the truly spooky warehouse with wonderful dolly shots throughout the film.  Additionally Mark Lee Fletcher's score is eerie and haunting only increasing the strength of the film's thriller capabilities.Ghost of the Needle is a fine compelling suspense story with fine acting and technical work.  This is a little film that deserves a big theatrical break.".

The weak elements though remain the same as in his first film. He I guess likes or has been forced to use lots of post redubbing of the actors voices an almost crippling problem with Freez'er and lesser but still problematic one here. It's not that the lips don't match up it's that it keeps reminding you it's been added later rather flat sounding and it hurts the uneven acting. Bradley himself this time gives himself the lead role unlike the supporting one he had in Freez'er and though he's not a bad actor he can't really carry the film. He's just not an interesting Psycho and the offbeat elements of the movie are held back rather than carried over the top by his performance. His choices are too routine. The film is almost overly grim in its treatment of women but it's off beat enough and well executed enough to not dip into the realm of pointless abuse. If he keeps making movies he needs to spend more time with his soundtracks and less time in front of the camera and more time behind it. He remains a director worth following.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a lowbudget Indie movie Ghost of the Needle was not bad at all far from perfect but one of the better ones. The dialogue is rather choppy with a few frothy unnecessary parts. The characters could have been developed more Jacob gets interesting in the latter parts of the movie but the rest came across as stock clichs. There are moments where the movie does get sluggish and like it's not going anywhere. And there is the odd plotline that disjoints things and bogs the movie down they also don't add a whole lot. However it does look quite good any effects are used minimally while the settings are appropriately grim while not overly so and the camera work is fluid and atmosphereenhancing. The music is creepy while the story has a great deal of suspense and quiet menace not all of it works but most of it does and very well. What happens isn't scary as such but there is almost always something unsettling the closing scene is tense and the idea of what Jacob does with the bodies is done harrowingly an equally harrowing idea to start with. Brian AvenentBradley directs reasonably stylishly and with a sense that he knows what he's doing. He's also in the lead role his performance is not a consistent one he's somewhat too sullen and uncertain to begin with but when Jacob has more to him later on he does make for a subtly menacing serial killer. The acting isn't awardworthy but it's not too bad Greg Thompson puts a lot into his performance and it shows he's very enjoyable to watch. All in all wasn't expecting much but Ghost of the Needle was an enjoyable and reasonably crafted movie but won't be for all tastes. 610 Bethany Cox".

Not Miiki Takashi's best work that would be Audition but certainly one of his most enjoyable and fun flicks! I am amazed that the director is so unknown outside of Japan because he really is a genius inventing cinema all over again. He is only in the movie making business for about four years but already has a body of work that counts no less than 15 movies which are all original and perfect in their own way. In Japan he is well known and is counted to the film avantgarde but none of his movies really got a wide cinema distribution. Most of his movies are relatively low budget and made for TV Video or small cinema release. Maybe this gives him the freedom to constantly reinvent himself and push the limit of moviemaking in general and perverse cruel detail in perticular.Now back to Dead or Alive. The first ten minutes are just breathtaking and eccentric. But after this the movie pulls back into a more conventional Yakuza vs. Cop story only to go completely over the top at the end. The end effectively blows up every genre convention and just HAS to be seen to be believed.The basic story is like I said quite conventional and simple a cop tries to solve a case of a group of hitman who have robbed an armored truck. This of course can not be done without getting personally involved and if that wasn't hard enough he has some grave family trouble too because his daughter needs an operation which he can not pay. Meanwhile the leader of the killer group is reunited with his younger brother he raised who does not know anything about his profession. The kid brother tough is destined to choose sides once he finds out that blood money payed for his college education abroad.  Meanwhile the band of killers gets involved in a yakuza gang war fighting over a drug cartel.The middle part in which the story unfolds is shown with very little action and at moments can be compared to the calm style of Takeshi Kitano. But Takashi's signature is always very clear and there are a lot of small perverse elements that illustrate his tendency to push it to the limit. There is a scene for example where a gangster kills a girl by drowning her in a kiddy pool filled with her own poop. But over all the story is told in a very compassionate way sometimes balancing on the edge of melodrama but never getting too sentimental because there always is a certain ironic detatchment. Despite this sometimes Kitanoesque detatchment and calm the movie succeeds in making you really care for and relate to the charakters. I think this really is a big accomplishment. Finally combining this more conventional 'humane' crimedrama story with the outrageousness of the beginning and the end and making this combination work shows how brilliant Takeshi really is. A director that has to be watched carefully!10 out of 10".

	schema:headline " More cinematic madness and style from Takashi Miike";
	schema:reviewBody "Takashi Miike's Dead or Alive 1999 begins perhaps as strikingly as ever possible. The very first 5 minutes of this film are incredibly fast paced and edited series of brutal and unexplained yet Yakuza murders and images from one sleazy night club in which this mayhem mostly takes place. After that the speed slows down remarkably and the rest of the film reminds me pretty much of the great art of Takeshi Kitano another Japanese cinema master. Dead or Alive tells the story of two men against each other one policeman who has to do dirty things with Yakuza in order to get money for his daughter's expensive medical treatment she has some dangerous and lethal disease and the other a charismatic Yakuza criminal and these two men are little like Danny Lee and Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's The Killer Both these men are on the different sides of the law but share many similar traits and thus respect each other. At the film's finale which is again extremely overthetop insanity they finally confront and it is again something as hysterical that can be invented only by this Japanese director or some other from the East. Dead or Alive's beginning and ending are as fast and outrageous as possible and the middle part of the film is very slow and calm. This creates an extremely effective contrast to the film and reminds me very much of Miike's masterpiece Fudoh from 1996.Dead or Alive includes many memorable characters which are from sick pervert Yakuzas who like to drown people into feces etc. to junkies and university fellows which all are interesting and personal in the hands of this director. The film tells about many sides of humanity and about things we don't usually want to discuss or at least films don't usually discuss! The most important element in the film however is the finale which thickens it all. The conclusion of this ultra original Yakuza drama is exactly the same as Fudoh's whole point which is that in the human nature and psyche there is this thing which necessarily doesn't make it impossible to categorize humans as brutes and savages as it all is destructed because of these reasons in Dead or Alive. Enemies cannot stop until it's too late and nobody is willing to give up. Man kills man and acts only more sophisticatedly than the actual animals and wild beasts of nature. This is very usual topic in Japanese honest cinema and it is one thing which usually makes their movies so unique and brilliant.The finale in Dead or Alive includes things which are not likely to be imagined especially when the whole film before it excluding the beginning of course was so calm and almost peaceful. The finale is very easy to take seriously as it's meant to be as Miike only says his things with different methods with the methods of this magic filled form of art. When people don't like elements like these in movies I think it's because of the fact that they don't want to  cannot accept all the possibilities of this art and thus cannot deal with such imagery and elements in films. It all has to be interpreted in order to understand what film maker has to say and give with hisher film. Miike has said he wants that the viewer can be entertained at the same time but I'm extremely happy that Miike still keeps these entertainment efforts on the background and things in his films which are meant to be entertaining are also very personal and tolerable and never calculated as in some Hollywood mainstream effort of nowadays'.Dead or Alive is no less cinematically stunning as Miike's other films. This includes fine use of photography and long shots without edits. The editing is also great especially in this first 5 minutes when the mayhem is so fierce. It all is done with skill and the fast edits never become irritating as they have been finished with care and interest. The often cartoonish violence is somewhat brutal at times and definitely the most graphic elements of this film will alienate most casual viewers as some of the characters and the acts they commit are very sick and repulsive. When a film is this symbolic and almost surreal the violence doesn't have to be realistic or believable either as it is too symbolic and one element in the film. I think Dead or Alive isn't gratuitously violent or sadistic as it all serves the morality of the characters and the world this film depicts.Dead or Alive isn't quite as great as Fudoh but still extremely pleasant film from Takashi Miike who makes films at incredible speed. He makes some 5 or more films per year and most of them are equally personal and inventively wild and mad. I hope this man can continue his freedom as a film maker and that he'd never go to mainstream not to speak of Hollywood! and fortunately his statements so far don't show signs about this. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing Oodishon and Koroshiya1 I became an instant fan of Miike Takashi's filmmaking style. His ability to present what would be in the hands of another director a hacknyed and familiar story is nothing short of brilliant. He takes old formulas and infuses them with new life sometimes through shock value confusion humor and actually brilliant filmmaking. His visuals are always incredible where even the most mundane shot looks like a great photograph proving that Miike has a great eye. So here we have Dead or Alive Hanzaisha the first in what would become one of the most controversial and bizarre trilogies in film history. It has relatively good acting and a great ensemble cast including two of my favorite Japanese actors besides Takeuchi and Aikawa there's Terajima Susumu and Osugi Ren both alumni of Kitano Beat Takeshi's films. Make no mistake this is not your runofthemill actiondrama movie.The overall story has been done basically the cop vs. criminal motif. Ryuichi Takeuchi Riki heads a small group of misfits who were once Chinese war orphans. Having no place either in the Chinese Triads or the Japanese Yakuza they wage their own little streetwar against both sides. Detective Jojima Aikawa Sho is hot on their trail but he has problems of his own. He knows his wife is cheating on him and their daughter is dying and he can not afford the operation needed to save her life. It sounds like something out of a John Woo movie right? Something akin to Hard Boiled or The Killer but whereas John Woo presents violence in an operatic sense Miike shows us something more hip and gritty.The beginning sequence of the film is a montage of everything from gay sex in a bathroom to snorting 18foot lines of cocaine to strippers to arterial spray to gluttony to...pretty much every deadly sin out there. Is it shocking not particularly at least not to me but the MTVstyle editing full of fast cuts sexual imagery and bright colors gives it a burst of adrenaline that is just a counterbalance to what becomes a very slow and quiet film for the most part. The main plot of the movie is presented in a style similar to Kitano Beat Takeshi with long shots and conversations between characters with only the most shocking acts of depravity made unshocking by the characters' reactions. There is a scene where Aikawa talks to an informant who is setting up to film a bestiality scene and his reaction is...almost nonexistent. Or the Yakuza's reaction to their boss drowning a girl in a kiddie pool full of her own feces. It should be shocking and disgusting and it is but the shock is diminished by the banality of it. It's as if Miike is playing with the audience testing our limits and asking us to question what we find acceptable. If another director presented these acts he or she might show it as if to glamorize it to overemphasize its putridity. Miike...just shows it as if it's normal and while some will be offended by this he has often made the claim that he just wants to get a reaction. And one way or the other he does. This is the point of the ending which for awhile matches the ultrahip attitude of the beginning before delving into territory best left to fantasy films. But again Miike has given us a surprise that is both shocking...and somehow expected because it's unexpected.The best way to explain this is that line from the movie Se7en when Morgan Freeman says to Brad Pitt If John Doe's head opens and a UFO flies out I want you to have expected it. This perfectly describes Dead or Alive Hanzaisha and Miike's style. If it's a Miike film you're going to see things that are unexpected and even offensive but because it's Miike you almost DO expect it and it almost DOES make a strange sense. Again he's playing with the audience. Do we really know what we want? Do we really know what to expect? No...and that is Miike's strength. So what if it breaks all the rules of good plot and storytelling so what if it breaks all the rules of good filmmaking? It's Miike and it's his formula in full swing. Dead or Alive Hanzaisha is pretty much the epitome of Miike's brand of filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the DVD for Dead or Alive the first in the trilogy director Takashi Miike is asked how he would describe the movie to someone who had no idea what it was about and he describes it as an enjoyable healthy Yakuza movie. 'Healthy' is a word I tried to put into context with the film after seeing it and I'm still not sure how it applies except maybe in the sense of Miike sticking to a good deal of conventions this time around. It's definitely not that one can't see Miike's mark all over the picture as it certainly isn't your grandfather's yakuzacrime movie matter of fact not even John Woo. It's just that with certain elements like the two main characters the detective Jojima Sho Aikawa who's the decent hardnosed sort with the wife and daughter and Ryuuichi Riki Takeuchi who has the face like one of those really crazy villain character actors in 40s filmnoir who wants to take over the mob in the area by any means necessary. I felt like I could've seen some of this in any given yakuza thriller albeit my lack of experience with the genre of VCinema in the 90s or yakuza thrillers in general.Then again for Miike he uses a lot of this to springboard his own visual ideas and real tricks with the material. The way he starts to film is truly and unequivocally disorienting I had to watch it twice just to sort of kind of get a sense of what the hell I was watching. It gives the impression which is both wrong and right with D.O.A. that it'll be a totally knockyoursocksoff work of gonzo filmmaking where aberrant sex brutal violence drugs and gangsters will always be lurking in the night most disturbing is with the scene in the public bathroom and then following it with the guy on the wheelspinner being controlled by a guy on a bike. As the story goes into gear however this montage usage disappears and Miike gravitates back into what one recognizes readily from his other films fairly long takes and deep focus and outbursts of insanely creative bits of trashy fun highlights here include a woman who dies via pool of feces which is actually really sick a bit involving bestiality out of the blue and a gigantic shootemup Chinese vs Japanese battle where Ryuuichi and his gang kill both clans in one swift stroke.Actually seeing Miike in more genrefamiliar territory isn't a bad thing and sometimes a scene will come up that's meant to play seriously and does where in a lesser director would go for the cheap bits with lesser actors. An example of this is the fate of a character's brother who betrays by taking money not really his and tries to talk his way out of it. So it's actually Miike still experimenting though it's not a totally fulfilling trip in part because the conventions start to dull up in the middle. It's when Miike finally gets into that last third with that wildly bloody shoot out including both hilarious flights of fancy a thug who was hiding comes out with a sword and goes apes all over one of the thugs and the tragic a character who was a surprise to show up gets killed. The fates grow darker for the detective character who really was just looking for money somehow for an operation for his daughter. But his allegiance to the law gets put aside and the final scene comes to a head.Here Miike finally puts his 'wildman of cinema' gears to full throttle and it's exciting as mentioned in trashy violent exploitive actionmovie ways ridiculous and in the end jawdroppingly funny. It's a good sign of things to come at the end with the two big stars of V Cinema duking it out as if it's the old West again and the sheriff and outlaw have nothing to lose except for their 'special surprises' up their sleeves at the last bloody gunned down moment. What came before it wasn't all that great overall and the first in the trilogy even with a few sweet near Xrated touches of physical and psychological disturbance doesn't amount to one of Miike's finest triumphs I wouldn't of traded seeing the last three minutes of the film final shot included for anything. 7.510".

This dramatic realism is somehow anchored in the otherwise chaotic flow of the rest of the film.  There's a real anythingcanhappen vibe to this film that keeps you on the edge yet when you reflect back upon it there are really only a few heavy action sequences.  I thought that was pretty brilliant though some may feel disappointed by the low count of flipped cars.  Hey wanna see an action film?

	schema:reviewBody "Dead or Alive asks some interesting questions if the audience is given 10 minutes of frenetic violence at the beginning are they supposed to expect it at the end? If that beginning violence is highly disturbing are they supposed to desire to see more violence at the end? And if the violence in the beginning is excessive how far could the violence during the rest of the movie go? Technically I'm familiar enough with Miike that I don't actually think he was all caught up in those questionsthey aren't what this movie is about. The real fact of the matter is that Miike's entire success as a filmmaker has everything to do with the fact that he refuses to censor himself and he has no filter.Dead or Alive has three parts the hyperkinetic extremely graphic beginning the dramatic and viscerally layered middle and the almost comedic and cartoonish ending. To be sure one could almost be disappointed in the way that the ending pretty much throws away all of the dramatic build up created by the beginning and the end. But upon second thought of course it's not like the ending is really required to live up to audience expectations. The two giants meet violence occurs the world ends. The end. It can be as simple as that.In a way the film is a lot more interesting because the two characters go beyond the typical doppelganger aspect of the duality between good and evil and are almost literally the same person. They both are disenfranchised they both only have enough emotional strength to care about their families and they both have basically the same responses to trauma. So when they meet they cancel each other out both literally and supernaturally. This is different than the ending of Ichi the Killer which has the same sort of twist ending the ending exceeds expectations by subverting them but where the opposing dualities of sadism and masochism cancel out instead.There could also be some stuff about ChineseJapanese relations that I could comment on but to be perfectly honest I'm unfamiliar with how that theme has weight to those ethnicities. I think the point at which the two men say We look Japanese... but we aren't. We look Chinese... but we aren't serves to illustrate the point about the actual similarities between the two leads. They look different... but they aren't. They look like one is supposed to beat the other... but they aren't.PolarisDiB".

	schema:headline " Cool energetic action grounded in copcrime genre but undone by cartoonishness...";
	schema:reviewBody "some minor spoilers This is a tough film to talk about. On the one hand it has one of the coolest most psychoenergetic opening sequences ever seen all rollicking to a thrashing garagemetal soundtrack. The rampage of a montage that opens the film features a lot of death and depravity ten foot lines of cocaine anyone? how about the homosexual rape scene in a men's room combined with a throat slashing? then there is another man who loses his dinner in a most violent way so if this isn't your kind of thing then stay away.But this opening doesn't really give us a taste of what to expect as much as it gives us a crazy energy to contrast the slower more dramatic crimecop realism that fills up much though certainly not all of the rest of the film. The rest of the film isn't really a letdown as much as it is a curious series of strange though often impressive and amusing but sometimes disappointing shifts in gears and tones. The main problem of this film is that even though it's mostly enjoyable it's strangely out of balance balance is a topic of conversation that comes up a few times among the cop characters in the film when they discuss the relationship between the yakuza and the police. It's as though Takashi Miike tries to keep this film out of balance on purpose perhaps to screw with his audience  and perhaps to create a film that is on the one hand a lot of fun but on the other hand grounded in the gritty realism depravity and sleaze that postindustrial Japan seems to have accepted as being part of its character.But just who is the audience for this film? Fans of extreme Asian cinema might be disappointed because they might feel slighted on the amount of gore action and depravity in this film. It's there but it frequently takes a second place to the copcrime story and domestic realism. And also fans of crime and yakuza films might be disappointed because the film is so cartoonish at times favoring silly absurd unrealistic action and violence that does not take the copcrimeyakuza genre seriously. But then again this disequilibrium of urban criminal grittiness and music video cartoonishness also gives the film a unique quality. The film lets us take most of the characters seriously to a slight degree though the main villain is mostly a cartoon. And we feel for no one in this film save the lead character  and barely anything for him and only toward the very end of the film. Perhaps because we feel for really no one in this film we are allowed to more easily accept the jarring changes and altering waves of style that flow through the film.Ultimately what one mostly takes away from this film is a sense of overthetop action stylistic mayhem and filthy depravity but underneath this style there are a multitude of characters and situations that are so funky and quirky that one can not help but be amused and sometimes quite impressed by the range of voices and images Takashi Miike tries to present to us. Some examples one scene shows a bunch of nameless drug traffickers on a barge inexplicably all eating bananas while one of them vomits from sea sickness another scene features the young brother of the main villain at a university lecture on the decline of and changes in Marxism in the 20th century yet another scene early in the film establishes how the main character's police chief boss has a love for flutes which he plays on top of a building in the afternoon. This is all combined with other more quiet moments of dramatic realism such as the young five year old son of a police officer who doesn't like salty Chinese food and two gang members who discuss what they want to do in the future one wants to open a car rental dealership in Australia while another very weirdly thinks he will become a god. Also there is an obsession in this film with the history of the Chinese in Japan  as though we're supposed to take this film seriously in that regard though it's difficult to take this film seriously on any level.However there is a good amount of perversity we would expect in a Miike film such as you guessed it bestiality and death by drugs and  uh  drowning in feces.A weird tension comes about when all of this is set against the crazily entertaining action that ultimately by the end is too overthetop. The ending by trying to be too outrageous ultimately insults our intelligence and leaves us feeling like we have to settle for a piece of bad Halloween candy as the dessert finale to a halfdecent though very strange meal. Fans of extreme cinema should check this out but don't expect too much of it to be too extreme  and accept its attempt to throw us off balance with it's unique mixture of grit quirkiness and humor despite the shortcomings in each of these areas. Expect some wild entertainment but don't expect to be wholly satisfied. This is one of the most brilliantly and disappointingly inconsistent extreme Japanese films ever made. The sequel is not as outrageous but it is more characterdriven somewhat more grounded and more satisfying.".

	onyx:emotionText "some minor spoilers This is a tough film to talk about. On the one hand it has one of the coolest most psychoenergetic opening sequences ever seen all rollicking to a thrashing garagemetal soundtrack. The rampage of a montage that opens the film features a lot of death and depravity ten foot lines of cocaine anyone? how about the homosexual rape scene in a men's room combined with a throat slashing? then there is another man who loses his dinner in a most violent way so if this isn't your kind of thing then stay away.But this opening doesn't really give us a taste of what to expect as much as it gives us a crazy energy to contrast the slower more dramatic crimecop realism that fills up much though certainly not all of the rest of the film. The rest of the film isn't really a letdown as much as it is a curious series of strange though often impressive and amusing but sometimes disappointing shifts in gears and tones. The main problem of this film is that even though it's mostly enjoyable it's strangely out of balance balance is a topic of conversation that comes up a few times among the cop characters in the film when they discuss the relationship between the yakuza and the police. It's as though Takashi Miike tries to keep this film out of balance on purpose perhaps to screw with his audience  and perhaps to create a film that is on the one hand a lot of fun but on the other hand grounded in the gritty realism depravity and sleaze that postindustrial Japan seems to have accepted as being part of its character.But just who is the audience for this film? Fans of extreme Asian cinema might be disappointed because they might feel slighted on the amount of gore action and depravity in this film. It's there but it frequently takes a second place to the copcrime story and domestic realism. And also fans of crime and yakuza films might be disappointed because the film is so cartoonish at times favoring silly absurd unrealistic action and violence that does not take the copcrimeyakuza genre seriously. But then again this disequilibrium of urban criminal grittiness and music video cartoonishness also gives the film a unique quality. The film lets us take most of the characters seriously to a slight degree though the main villain is mostly a cartoon. And we feel for no one in this film save the lead character  and barely anything for him and only toward the very end of the film. Perhaps because we feel for really no one in this film we are allowed to more easily accept the jarring changes and altering waves of style that flow through the film.Ultimately what one mostly takes away from this film is a sense of overthetop action stylistic mayhem and filthy depravity but underneath this style there are a multitude of characters and situations that are so funky and quirky that one can not help but be amused and sometimes quite impressed by the range of voices and images Takashi Miike tries to present to us. Some examples one scene shows a bunch of nameless drug traffickers on a barge inexplicably all eating bananas while one of them vomits from sea sickness another scene features the young brother of the main villain at a university lecture on the decline of and changes in Marxism in the 20th century yet another scene early in the film establishes how the main character's police chief boss has a love for flutes which he plays on top of a building in the afternoon.

But being a loyal fan I did took a look at one of his many yakuza movie. I find it suspicious when a director is obsessed with a theme... I listened to that movie with some suspicious in the back of my mind.Before the movie I found an interview with Miike on the DVD where I thought he was childish about the violence in his movies. Fact is Takashi Miike discovered himself as an intelligent filmmaker..it all started up with the very Hitchcockian Audition. Dead Or Alive was before that...As far as a genre movie goes it's pretty good. It has the best damn gun fights i've ever seen. The opening sequence is mind blowing and shows a lot about Miike's INCREDIBLE talent to film violence and make it larger than life. Sadly it gets a bit slow and lazy after that. Miike is offering looong shots trying to be an unorthodox filmmakers but except for his shots taken into the corner of the rooms it cuts the rhythm bad. Usually I like Miike for pissing on Antonioni's style but this one seem to recreate the comtemplativity of the old Italian.And...my major upset...The sht bath scene.SPOILERS. OK...I think there is a way to film everything...INCLUDING A WAY TO FILM PP YES! He brilliantly achieved it in Bizita Q making the necrophilia scene even more grime. But this one is just a childish disgusting scene of a prostitute drowning in her sht. It has no meaning in the move and it sucks. If I want scat porn i'm gonna get it trough the internet. If you are and intelligent film maker like Miike and film this kind of atrocity...FILM IT GOOD GODDMIT and not like an amateur internet porn camera....I feel relieved maybe i'll stop nightmaring about it now...The ending scene gets the movie into the cult zone damn this is a contemporary western dual with incredible weapons. This is AWESOME! The opening and the ending sequence makes me happy that i've seen it...but it wasn't one of the best Miike......In fact for his standard it was ordinary".

One of the main characters Ryu shows barely any emotion throughout even at points where he clearly should. An event that directly precedes the ending is in my book one of the most unexpected twists in Miike history. The ending itself is just ridiculous.Unless you're a college student like me or a fan of the absurd this ending will validate throwing the movie away. While it may seem like I'm a little harsh its only because I've set my standards for Miike so high. Overall a good movie to watch if you like Japanese exploitation films.".

It's a standard tale of revenge and redemption but there's something special about it. It taps into the raw and savage power of film. The action and violence are unbelievable but there are breaks in between to let the viewer slow down and take a deep breath. In these breaks there are hints at social commentary. One scene sums this up Goose watching two children shoot each other with toy guns. It's so short and there's no dialogue but it certainly says a lot. There's an unspoken element there that's missing from most action movies. I honestly expected all of the reviews I read to dog the film. To my surprise it was actually wellreceived. It seems as though everyone who has experienced Deadbeat appreciates the awkward feelings it inspires. Deadbeat at Dawn is truly an American independent action classic.Note The Spider's outfits with the underwear on the outside were created as an homage to A Clockwork Orange.".

	schema:headline " Legendary independent film from Jim Van Bebber";
	schema:reviewBody "Deadbeat at Dawn is directed written and created by Jim Van Bebber a film student who decided to make a low budget feature film in the tradition of Evil Dead and other drivein blockbusters that were hugely popular in the 80's and made a lot of money. He created Deadbeat at Dawn with his fellow students and friends and finally his first feature film was completed in 1988 and what a film that is!Bebber himself plays Goose a leader in street gang who decides to quit the violent and dangerous gang life and start a peaceful life with his girlfriend Christy. Goose's gang is Ravens and the rival gang is Spiders. Spiders don't like Goose quitting the gang life and they arrange Goose's murder. That doesn't succeed instead they murder Christy in brutal way while Goose is on his final drug deal somewhere in dirty streets of Ohio. When he finds her beloved girlfriend killed and savagely mutilated he starts the savage fight for life and only one thing in mind revenge.I had extremely high expectations on this film and then I finally ordered the expensive DVD and watched the film. I must say I'm not disappointed but still the film is not as great as I hoped. My all time favorite US underground film is Buddy Giovinazzo's incredible and ultra disturbing masterpiece Combat Shock which is still far more powerful and relentless than Van Bebber's film. Deadbeat at Dawn is very grim and dirty but it is not as relentless and emotionally powerful as Combat Shock or Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver. Deadbeat at Dawn relies on savage brutality and the result is interesting and definitely works in its own genre.The settings are very dirty and scummy as there are drug users prostitutes and all kinds of diseases found in big cities and modern society. Goose is only little better than the bad guys in this film and the bad guys are REALLY bad and revolting and all the actors mostly amateurs made incredible job in this film as the most fierce moments were improvised and developed when the camera was already rolling. The scene where Bonecrusher swears how he hates people I hate people!! I really fun' hate people!! is very menacing as this guy is really nuts and dangerous and he is equally bad as the film's main villain Danny the leader of the rival gang. The only positive characters in the film are the two females Christy and her sister and according to director Van Bebber that is one of the film's themes Goose had the possibility to start a better life with the help of this element of peace and beauty Christy but since he didn't understand it in time and couldn't realize itsher value he finally lost Christy and had nothing left only anger and willing to revenge. He knew this all might end badly for himself too but that didn't matter since he had lost the light of his life after the revenge there would be nothing.The film has also bits of social commentary. Van Bebber has said that at least the scenes at the garage and little boys pretending to shoot at each other have a meaning and criticize our society and world in different ways. The garage scene says something about how easy it is to get a gun in US as everyone seems to have one even old people and seemingly peaceful persons. This film depicts the world and society that has been created this horrible and ugly by its inhabitants themselves. This film is very rough as it shows the ugliest sides of modern day life and things that we and films in general especially mainstream don't usually want to accept or talk about.The various fight scenes are shot and edited pretty stylishly. Couple of scenes have perhaps little fast edits and thus become too restless but mostly this film is greatly mace with the very low budget. The soundtrack is also very menacing and ominous at times and it adds much to the atmosphere. This film proves the talent of Jim Van Bebber and shows what kind of results can be achieved with talent and innovation. Not only this film is grim and ugly in its scenery and world it takes place it is also ultra violent and graphic. The gang fights are as bloody as possible and nothing has been left to imagination. All strokes of nunchukas and knifes are visible and they hurt as if the viewer was hit himself. Only act of violence that's left to imagination is the beating and killing of Christy and Van Bebber said that it was intentional as sometimes less is more and he definitely didn't want to make this horrible scene graphic and full of on screen blood and I think it is now as brutal as possible. The violence in Deadbeat at Dawn is very strong especially during the film's last fight when Goose finally gets face to face with the gang members who killed his girl and caused this mayhem. People are sliced with blades hurt with throwing stars blasted by guns with ultra gory wounds beaten to shapeless killed by ripping off a throatlarynx  a scene that is perhaps even more graphic and off putting than the finale in Japanese Sonny Chiba's legendary Street Fighter 1974 a film which has also a similar throat ripping scene. Deadbeat at Dawn is so overthetop violent and gory piece of independent cinema I think this will and alienates many fans of marginal cinema too as I know many so called film fanatics specialized in B films and underground that simply HATE Deadbeat at Dawn and speak very badly about it! Deadbeat at Dawn is so gritty and violent mentally and physically that it is far too hard to take for most of the people. Of course it's true that cinema this underground has always small audience so it's not any surprise so many hate this film. I don't hate this but don't like it as highly as I wanted to. Maybe I had too high expectations after experiencing Combat Shock so many times before Deadbeat.Deadbeat at Dawn is pretty immoral film since the violence and act of revenge feels pretty gratuitous at times but that can still be interpreted as a very brutal bit of commentary about life and society. This film is so full of hate and anger it definitely means something and shocks the senses of the viewer. Still the film is somewhat shallow and relies maybe too much on these fierce scenes of violence and if the film had such a strong message and emotional elements as Taxi Driver for instance this would definitely be a great masterpiece of independent cinema. Therefore I give this 810 instead of more and recommend this film ONLY for very tolerant film fans and people who like and understand underground cinema of Jrg Buttgereit and Abel Ferrara for instance and films like Combat Shock BaiseMoi Last House on the Left and other extremely grim and depressing films films that demand a lot from the viewer.".

	onyx:emotionText "Deadbeat at Dawn is directed written and created by Jim Van Bebber a film student who decided to make a low budget feature film in the tradition of Evil Dead and other drivein blockbusters that were hugely popular in the 80's and made a lot of money. He created Deadbeat at Dawn with his fellow students and friends and finally his first feature film was completed in 1988 and what a film that is!Bebber himself plays Goose a leader in street gang who decides to quit the violent and dangerous gang life and start a peaceful life with his girlfriend Christy. Goose's gang is Ravens and the rival gang is Spiders. Spiders don't like Goose quitting the gang life and they arrange Goose's murder. That doesn't succeed instead they murder Christy in brutal way while Goose is on his final drug deal somewhere in dirty streets of Ohio. When he finds her beloved girlfriend killed and savagely mutilated he starts the savage fight for life and only one thing in mind revenge.I had extremely high expectations on this film and then I finally ordered the expensive DVD and watched the film. I must say I'm not disappointed but still the film is not as great as I hoped. My all time favorite US underground film is Buddy Giovinazzo's incredible and ultra disturbing masterpiece Combat Shock which is still far more powerful and relentless than Van Bebber's film. Deadbeat at Dawn is very grim and dirty but it is not as relentless and emotionally powerful as Combat Shock or Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver. Deadbeat at Dawn relies on savage brutality and the result is interesting and definitely works in its own genre.The settings are very dirty and scummy as there are drug users prostitutes and all kinds of diseases found in big cities and modern society. Goose is only little better than the bad guys in this film and the bad guys are REALLY bad and revolting and all the actors mostly amateurs made incredible job in this film as the most fierce moments were improvised and developed when the camera was already rolling. The scene where Bonecrusher swears how he hates people I hate people!! I really fun' hate people!! is very menacing as this guy is really nuts and dangerous and he is equally bad as the film's main villain Danny the leader of the rival gang. The only positive characters in the film are the two females Christy and her sister and according to director Van Bebber that is one of the film's themes Goose had the possibility to start a better life with the help of this element of peace and beauty Christy but since he didn't understand it in time and couldn't realize itsher value he finally lost Christy and had nothing left only anger and willing to revenge. He knew this all might end badly for himself too but that didn't matter since he had lost the light of his life after the revenge there would be nothing.The film has also bits of social commentary. Van Bebber has said that at least the scenes at the garage and little boys pretending to shoot at each other have a meaning and criticize our society and world in different ways. The garage scene says something about how easy it is to get a gun in US as everyone seems to have one even old people and seemingly peaceful persons. This film depicts the world and society that has been created this horrible and ugly by its inhabitants themselves. This film is very rough as it shows the ugliest sides of modern day life and things that we and films in general especially mainstream don't usually want to accept or talk about.The various fight scenes are shot and edited pretty stylishly. Couple of scenes have perhaps little fast edits and thus become too restless but mostly this film is greatly mace with the very low budget. The soundtrack is also very menacing and ominous at times and it adds much to the atmosphere. This film proves the talent of Jim Van Bebber and shows what kind of results can be achieved with talent and innovation. Not only this film is grim and ugly in its scenery and world it takes place it is also ultra violent and graphic. The gang fights are as bloody as possible and nothing has been left to imagination. All strokes of nunchukas and knifes are visible and they hurt as if the viewer was hit himself. Only act of violence that's left to imagination is the beating and killing of Christy and Van Bebber said that it was intentional as sometimes less is more and he definitely didn't want to make this horrible scene graphic and full of on screen blood and I think it is now as brutal as possible. The violence in Deadbeat at Dawn is very strong especially during the film's last fight when Goose finally gets face to face with the gang members who killed his girl and caused this mayhem. People are sliced with blades hurt with throwing stars blasted by guns with ultra gory wounds beaten to shapeless killed by ripping off a throatlarynx  a scene that is perhaps even more graphic and off putting than the finale in Japanese Sonny Chiba's legendary Street Fighter 1974 a film which has also a similar throat ripping scene. Deadbeat at Dawn is so overthetop violent and gory piece of independent cinema I think this will and alienates many fans of marginal cinema too as I know many so called film fanatics specialized in B films and underground that simply HATE Deadbeat at Dawn and speak very badly about it! Deadbeat at Dawn is so gritty and violent mentally and physically that it is far too hard to take for most of the people. Of course it's true that cinema this underground has always small audience so it's not any surprise so many hate this film. I don't hate this but don't like it as highly as I wanted to. Maybe I had too high expectations after experiencing Combat Shock so many times before Deadbeat.Deadbeat at Dawn is pretty immoral film since the violence and act of revenge feels pretty gratuitous at times but that can still be interpreted as a very brutal bit of commentary about life and society. This film is so full of hate and anger it definitely means something and shocks the senses of the viewer. Still the film is somewhat shallow and relies maybe too much on these fierce scenes of violence and if the film had such a strong message and emotional elements as Taxi Driver for instance this would definitely be a great masterpiece of independent cinema. Therefore I give this 810 instead of more and recommend this film ONLY for very tolerant film fans and people who like and understand underground cinema of Jrg Buttgereit and Abel Ferrara for instance and films like Combat Shock BaiseMoi Last House on the Left and other extremely grim and depressing films films that demand a lot from the viewer.";

Deadbeat At Dawn is a very gritty picture that tells the tale of Goose and his story of vengeance on his exrival gang the Spiders. I could go deeper into the storyline of why he's seeking revenge but that's kinda ruining the story for you.I was pleasantly surprised with this one. At first I was kinda wary but with the overthetop acting and violence I was easily swayed into enjoying it. The film more than anything is very gritty. Filthy feeling. And actually kind of feels like the movie Street Trash in this way. Going back to the acting I was happy with how most of the characters were portrayed and you should be too if you're even slightly into exploitation movies of the 70s and 80s. Oh it was also pretty funny too.Deadbeat At Dawn was a pretty entertaining flick that delivered the goods in terms of a rough and tough gang flick mixed with 80s charm  our lead character is ace with ninja stars and nunchuks. Tie in an awesomely violent ending you've got yourself 80 minutes of pure exploitation goodness.".

	schema:reviewBody "You can't talk about a movie like DEADBEAT AT DAWN without putting it into context as to when and how it was made. If you do then you make it far more difficult to describe just what a cult fan favorite the movie is and why. And if ever a movie deserved to be called a cult film this is it.Made in 1988 as the midnight movie faze was petering out and the home video craze was peaking the movie found its way into the hearts and minds of its fans video VHS. Not just in the stores that were renting the film but in the numerous bootleg copies that were out there passed along from one anxious pair of hands to another. The word was out about this small film made on a meager budget with zero name brand stars that just messed with the minds of all who witnessed it. That made seeing the movie all the more desirable to those looking for something new and different.The story in the film is simple really but what unfolds on screen is unique. Directorwriter Jim Van Bebber stars as Goose the leader of a gang known as the Ravens in Dayton Ohio. Their arch rivals are the Spiders led by Danny Paul Harper. When the film opens the Spiders are entering Raven territory a huge cemetery. The two leaders face off in a hand to hand fight that leaves both battered and bloody but with Goose getting the upper hand.Returning home Goose nurses his wounds with the help of his girlfriend Christie Megan Murphy. Christie dearly loves Goose but knows that this lifestyle will lead him to certain death. She tells him that if he doesn't give up the gang then she's leaving. Realizing how much she means to him and taking her at her word he agrees to give up the gang.

The gang has joined up with the Spiders now and a huge heist is in the making. What this new leader doesn't realize is that Danny plans on double crossing the gang and taking them all out once the job is done. With nearly everyone in his life now gone only Goose is left to seek revenge on Danny and the remaining members of the Spiders.The movie was the first feature film shot entirely in Dayton. To say it was made on a low budget is being generous. It was made for around 10000 and shot over a four year period. Van Bebber not only wrote directed and starred in the film he also edited designed the effects and did his own stunts. And the effects here are some of the goriest you will find between hands partially blown away and more. That he could reach his goal of making a feature film that contained his vision without studio interference and that we're talking about it now some 30 years later is an accomplishment.There are certainly moments that could have had more polish added to them stunts that professionals might have done better and certainly the film could look better than the grainy appearance that it has. But all of those things are what make up the charm of this film. It IS the grainy picture it IS the slightly off punches it IS the touch and go acting ability of those involved and some moments are great when it comes to performances that make up a movie that earned its cult status by being true to itself. This is the first movie of a 21 year old director and it shows but in a good way. The heart involved in the film makes up for the unpolished appearance.Arrow Film is bringing the movie out for a 30th anniversary release. Said Van Bebber about the release last year It's slated for a 4K transfer from the original AB rolls supervised by me and a long overdue Bluray release on it's 30th anniversary. True to his word that's what you'll find in this new release of the film to bluray. And the extras are sure to make fans go crazy. They include a new audio commentary track with Van Bebber Harper and Cody Lee Hardin moderated by Victor Bonacore who made DIARY OF A DEADBEAT THE STORY Jim Van Bebber Deadbeat Forever! a new retrospective documentary on Van Bebber and the legacy of the film by Bonacore that includes rare footage interviews and more an archival 1986 behind the scenes documentary from VHS by Nate Pennington outtakes four newly restored shorts from Van Bebber Into the Black My Sweet Satan Roadkill The Last Days of John Martin and Gator Green a Van Bebber music video collection including neverbeforeseen director's cuts Chunkblower a promotional trailer for an unfinished Gary Blair Smith produced feature an extensive image gallery with never before seen still a reversible sleeve with newly commissioned artwork by Peter Strain and for the first pressing only a collector's booklet featuring new writing by Scott Gabbey and Graham Rae. It will take longer to get through the extras than the movie itself!As with all things Arrow they've outdone themselves with this release. Fans of the film will now have the chance to have it in the best possible format available with all of the extra goodies to keep them entertained and watching for several hours. If you're a fan of the film you'll love this edition of it. If you've never seen it prepare to have your senses blown away and your stomach churned.".

	onyx:emotionText "You can't talk about a movie like DEADBEAT AT DAWN without putting it into context as to when and how it was made. If you do then you make it far more difficult to describe just what a cult fan favorite the movie is and why. And if ever a movie deserved to be called a cult film this is it.Made in 1988 as the midnight movie faze was petering out and the home video craze was peaking the movie found its way into the hearts and minds of its fans video VHS. Not just in the stores that were renting the film but in the numerous bootleg copies that were out there passed along from one anxious pair of hands to another. The word was out about this small film made on a meager budget with zero name brand stars that just messed with the minds of all who witnessed it. That made seeing the movie all the more desirable to those looking for something new and different.The story in the film is simple really but what unfolds on screen is unique. Directorwriter Jim Van Bebber stars as Goose the leader of a gang known as the Ravens in Dayton Ohio. Their arch rivals are the Spiders led by Danny Paul Harper. When the film opens the Spiders are entering Raven territory a huge cemetery. The two leaders face off in a hand to hand fight that leaves both battered and bloody but with Goose getting the upper hand.Returning home Goose nurses his wounds with the help of his girlfriend Christie Megan Murphy. Christie dearly loves Goose but knows that this lifestyle will lead him to certain death. She tells him that if he doesn't give up the gang then she's leaving. Realizing how much she means to him and taking her at her word he agrees to give up the gang. Before he leaves his life of crime behind he has one last thing to do the sale of drugs to put himself and Christie in a position to leave.But while he's out members of the Spiders show at their apartment.

	schema:reviewBody "It's me again shooting out another quickie for you guys and gals to check out. This time it is from the genre known as Cult Cinema. The movie is Deadbeat at Dawn and is an independent film by and starring Jim Van Bebber that plays out in some ways like a poor mans The Warriors with a few other action movie elements thrown in.First let me say that I have to give them kudos for doing some of the stuff they did in this film. Obviously filmed on a shoestring budget they pull off some rather impressive action and gore sequences. Overall I was impressed with this part of the film.The story itself is pretty simple Goose Jim Van Bebber who is the leader of a gang called The Ravens ops to leave the group as he is deeply in love with his girlfriend who wants him to leave his life of fighting behind. Shortly after another gangs leader seeking revenge on him has his girlfriend killed.From there Goose really begins to lose it as he moves back in with his junkie father leaves him then drinks himself to a near death before he is gave an offer to rejoin The Ravens and do a heist for them. It just so happens that the 2 rival gangs have now joined sides and the leader of the other gang The Spiders still wants Goose dead. Goose also wants him dead which leads into a grand finally full of kung fu decapitations and ninja stars to the cranium.The film is a great accomplishment for independent film making and even though the acting in parts is not that great it still delivers a tight package. My only complaint there is a long break in the action between the time of his girlfriends death to the big heist which leaves you with a lot of meandering and talking which is not what this film excels in. If you can look past that and keep your expectations low you will find quite a few things to enjoy about this film.710 Worth a look for fans of action films independent films and the ever desperate gore hounds as though there is gore scenes there is not a large amount. It may not deliver in every area but it will entertain you for 90 minutes.Synapse release of this film on DVD seems to be a descent transfer though I have heard the director is not pleased at some of the colors and lighting that the transfer may have slightly altered. Regardless this is probably the best it has ever looked. If you can find it which it is getting harder to obtain I would recommend a look. A strong rental title to say the least.".

As much as I hope for more from his particular flavor of cinema I still didn't get to tell him that I think this movie is downright the best piece he ever made. This is his heart and soul readers.I've seen just about everything JVB has made but the perfect storm energies and circumstances that made this movie are still something that's evident to cinephiles and the like. I can't say it's sheer brilliance this is style not substance Oh the 80's and I don't think that JVB is big on messages anyhow but I'm hard pressed to find anything as endearing by him as this movie.Gutterpunk culture abounds JVB's love of Dayton's microcosmic abysmal atmosphere of a bankrupt rustbelt town that's falling apart at the midline and you get Deadbeat at Dawn. Very precise scheduling and editing it's what ya gotta do if you have no budget for film and manhours give this a somewhat frenzied pace as well a feeling of Goose as kind of a mythological character consecrated to the street life. The soundtrack and dialogue keep the tension to a steady hum until the end sequence.The story is basic simple chopsocky territory but you be hardpressed to find as stylish as this as far martialarts flicks go. All the character development is beautiful in that is serves to paint a very dismal world where everyone even the welloff ones we don't see in the movie that often has that next moment to live for and nothing else. You have drugs everywhere you have an indifferent and ignorant populace you have gangs armed with no real direction and all the trappings of a late 80's Midwestern society sharpened to a point. I always liked the martial arts sequences in this one JVB studied Benny The Jet and it shows.The odd thoughtfulness of Deadbeat At Dawn give it the heart it has you see scenes of how violence can drive one to insanity at rationalizing indifference to it's nature. You see someone who had to fight for literally everything in his life and how it would just keep him spinning his wheels faster than everyone else until he couldn't stop. You see fleeting glory and permanent indolence. It's gritty to the core and that's why I love it. 12".

But now that he is not connected The Spiders seize the day and get revenge on Goose starting a hell storm of revenge that ends up becoming one of the coolest paybacks you will ever see in cinematic history.When I first saw a clip of this movie I was reading reviews on IMDb before I purchased Deadbeat at Dawn. A review stated If you liked playing Double Dragon on your Nintendo you will love this movie! I saw some clips online and understood what the reviewer was saying. The last twenty minutes of this movie will make you feel like your playing a kick ass video game from the eighties.Van Bebber actually has some fighting skills and is pretty awesome with the nun chucks. He beats a ton of gang members up.The worst thing about Deadbeat at Dawn is that not enough people are aware of this low budget masterpiece. This is a grind house film not some over produced multimillion dollar budgeted film with a filter over it. This is the real deal Holyfield.The film is all around dirty and gritty it carries a no holds barred I'm making a brutal movie approach throughout and leaves the viewer in awe.".

Though I have nothing against the people that made the following movies it is a joke that Little Nicky The Grudge and a million other mainstream 'vessel for the stars' flicks will receive so much more attention than films of this ilk. What Van Bebber has achieved here is nothing short of amazing a gritty powerful movie with fight scenes better than the choreographed run of the mill stuff you'll viddy in most films. It's the sort of movie which inspires. And although I'm too lazy to get off my ass it makes me want to make my own low budget movie. Don't get me wrong I'm not anti Hollywood and not every low budget film is this good but please watch this film enjoy it and then tell your friends about it. Together we will educate the world!!!".

I think the excesses of the character are supposed to be funny. However Cage not only takes Eddie over the top but down the other side  he chews up the scenery digests it and poops it out right there in front of you. For some reason he seems to think the character should always be on the edge of having a seizure. The cumulative effect for me is to flinch from the thought of ever again seeing him in a film. Really. Like aversion therapy. Say Nick Cage and I will think of him drooling and choose another film.And the film suddenly veers off into an Italian James Bond ripoff!

In a stylish secret lair behind a billiard parlor we meet Angus Scrimm the Tall Man from Phantasm as Dr. Lyme the man obsessed with diamonds. Crystals are everywhere his female henchmen are decked out in big blobby crystal jewelry the furniture is designed with crystalline angles. He comes complete with a Dr. No suit a Sidney Greenstreet growl and  get this!  a metal arm with a sharp shiny lobsterclaw hand! No fooling. My jaw dropped. At least he wasn't stroking a cat.Throw in Charlie Sheen as a suave pool hustler and Mickey Dolenz and Clarence Williams III ! as sidekicks and you have quite a stew. Peter Fonda looks like he is thinking about his shopping list. James Coburn the primary reason I picked up the film definitely classes things up but we don't see enough of him.This film isn't quite a train wreck but it is something of a demolition derby.

This is an everpopular concept which games like Grand Theft Auto have excelled in but this film just wasn't good. The money must have been spent on the cast. This was the first 'deadfall' in Biehn's career luckily he was still cast in Tombstone later that year.

However the 30 minutes he is in the movie include some of the most quotable lines in Nic Cage history. The rest of the movie is watching the former Kyle Resse sleepwalking through a modern day film noir movie alongside James Coburn who honestly looks ashamed to be in this movie. Peter Fonda makes a brief cameo that is so short that if you blink you might possibly miss it.

	schema:reviewBody "In his autobiography WideEyed in Babylon Ray Milland told about witnessing a performance by Charles Laughton while costarring with him in Payment Deferred.First Laughton rolled his eyes until only the whites showed. Then his lips twitched and quivered and then he began to slobber. This went on until Milland was convinced Laughton was having an epileptic fit. Finally the director called Cut.Milland discreetly asked the director whether he considered what he had just witnessed to be fine acting. The director assured him that it wasn't simply sheer selfindulgence but that Milland shouldn't start feeling superior because he would be doing it himself if he lasted that long. The director considered it an occupational disease with most actors.This goes a long way towards explaining Nicholas Cage's performance in Deadfall.The film is about con men involving the same con that was the basis of The Sting. Deadfall made in 1993 predates 2003's Confidence in 'paying homage' to that great movie. Joe Dolan played by Michael Biehn is involved in a sting that goes wrong when he accidentally shoots and kills his father Mike Dolan. With his dying words Mike sends his son to find his Uncle Lou. Mike and Lou are both played by James Coburn. Lou decides to bring Joe in on a life fulfilling long con and teams him up with Eddie his righthand man. Eddie played by Nicholas Cage becomes stressed by Joe's presence and this leads to increasingly excessive behaviour. Cage's performance is startling. To portray Eddie's anger management issues Cage must have felt that tantrums along the lines of a child experiencing the terrible twos would be about right. After a fight with his girlfriend Cage lays on a bed kicking and screaming. Cage also adopted a false nose for the role as though he knew he was going to cut loose and possibly felt he needed a little anonymity. One is forced to ask if the director Christopher Copolla had any control over Cage at all? The answer could lie in the fact that Nicholas Cage is Christopher Copolla's brother  his little bro' in fact. Joe becomes involved in his uncle's scam. The mark is one Dr. Lyme who has a taste for beautiful diamonds. Distractingly the doctor wears an artificial hand that features a large pair of scissors not unlike Edward Scissorhands' in hedge trimming mode. This arresting prosthesis gives his character a cartoonish quality  just another odd element in a movie that lacks a consistent style. The scam goes down and the movie ends with a series of twists that are too contrived to create much impact. Deadfall is unbalanced by some extreme characterisations and is so derivative that there is not much originality left in the film  other than Nicholas Cage's performance that is.".

James Coburn is in it and plays a good part for the type of actor he is its cool that he can be in such eccentric little films such as this one even though he has done so much in film in his life already.this film has a little mystery a little dark eccentric humor some thugs and mostly set at nighttime but Nicholas Cage's character is the most memorable one because he plays a highstrung over the edge guy and he really gets into character because his voice is different he has a fake moustache cheap haircut sunglasses and weird eyes it is such an eccentric character that he put out there which i love.there is one particular moment i recall that was funny in an eccentric way he was in a strip club and he was all strungout and drinking or on drugs and he was messing with the stripper on stage and then on his way out he throws a drink on a random stranger and then proceeds to stand in the middle of the whole place with his arms raised and yells FK YOOOOUUUUUUUU !!!!!!! and then on his way out the door he snaps and does a karatechop kungfu move on some guy for no reason at all and kicks the living crap out of himhahaha.................btw just from me being a little too observant i noticed that in that scene when he yells the F word i noticed there is a guy sitting at a table behind him with a black tshirt with bold white letters saying the same thing F Y and i just thought it was weird that they did that.its just an OK movie to watch if your a Nicholas Cage fan and like dark humor and indy type films or mysteries and thats that.".

The dying Coburn head of the crew gives a cryptic message to his son which sets Biehn on an oddessy to find an uncle he never knew he had. In the process an odd assortment of over the top and incoherent characters parades through the story. This movie should have been the end of Nicolas Cage's career. A performance like that has been the end of many before but their names aren't Coppola. The unrealistic story falls short of campy or parody and leads up to a twist where James Coburn has set the whole thing up is not really dead and the uncle was played by him all along. Biehn leaves the grifter lifestyle disillusioned and alone. As many before seem to have said Michael Biehn James Coburn Charlie Sheen Peter Fonda and the rest of the decent cast could have been enough to carry even this weak script and have made it watchable. Except the Coppola team of Nicholas Cage and Christopher Coppola seem to have gone the extra mile to sabotage them. Nicholas Cage is an actor who thinks that method acting means talking in weird unintelligible accents and dressing like a complete boob. According to the trivia on this movie he thought that was more believable. I would ask On what planet? It was distracting and annoying. I think it was his attempt at scenestealing. I give it a 2 because as bad as it was  watching Biehn and Coburn wasn't ALL bad. The wardrobe of Sarah Trigger had a very nice 1940's feel without being 1940's at all. VERY risqu sex scene between Trigger and Biehn. Overall Change the channel.".

In the art of the con father and son team Coburn who double stars here and Biehn are the best. When the con backfires and Coburn is killed Biehn makes a fatherly promise to track down his Uncle a slicker white haired Coburn and retrieve some stolen valuables. It's here that Biehn meets some particular weird types none weirder of course than movie stealer Cage in a great purposely overacted performance that's deserves some acting award may'be great overacting. He's hilarious. His beautiful girlfriend Back for Revenge's Sarah Trigger is not all she seems as are many others and it's great to see her get her gear off. You'll never see the big pay off in the end the ultimate con which kind of really have bad repercussions for one party. There are some surprisingly take note memorable performances in particular that of Charlie Sheen as a dark menacing figure who spouts lines from Mark Twain novels a fantastic pool player you don't want to cross. The other notable performance is that of Peter Fonda as one of Uncle's Coburn's bodyguards who you wish you saw more of him in this he's that good. But of course it's Cage's scenes that you're gonna love especially if you're a Nic Cage fan. I like the fact Deadfall chooses to be something different an off the wall crime caper with characters of insanity the only sane being Biehn who really didn't really exude himself enough. Or was he 'spose to play it down pat? He just didn't really do it for me just being upstage by some classic acting performances. His sane character is an amusing contrast to the others. We even have one guy who would put Edward Scissorhands to shame. There so many things that make this film fun but I know the main reason for watching it again Cage.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is so much true 1940's film noir feel underlying the slightly desaturated color the ending especially. I would go so far as to say this is a NeoNoir film due to the weaving of twisting of the characters lunacy namely Eddy Played by Nicholas Cage. Richard Widmark has played some wild out of control villains who moved from one thought so dangerously that were hinging off of the edge of your seat and his just to see what might happen next. Cage has continued to build a wonderful collection of original characters who entertain and thrill on many levels and this film gave him the story framework to do a little glassblowing using every color in the rainbow into very hot glass. The production design was idiomatically very thoughtful and flowed seamlessly from one scene to the next. This picture knew the importance of the location in this noirish tale as never backdrop but character inspiring the events and interactions. I can only think how fun it must have been to introduce characters such as Dr. Lyme into the story something a bit James Bond fantastic but hey I've seen some freakish dudes in the East Bronx who did business with his uh cutting precision. Sarah Trigger and Michael Biehn had good chemistry and maybe bee more flirtatious with the lens they played so pretty I almost wanted to remind how seamy the other characters around them were. Wonderful to hear Talia Shire's beautiful voice up close something you don't get to do too often...James Coburn turned in a stellar menacing performance Peter Fonda nice cameo flavor...Charlie Sheen brought the smooth and delivered it well in the most fitting red velvet smoking jacket. Smoking Jackets  Merry go Rounds  a death scene that surpasses the Coen bros wood chipper in Fargo A FRYOLATOR  I'll recover these are the sights that will meld in a haze of twirling smoke for me. But I like to sum things up with this line from Joe in a classic Sam Spade moment realizing the greatest con of all...That photo was the hook that sent me deeper into the shadows squinting for the truth. Watch it to find out! P.S. looking for more cult coverage here.".

The story  writer moves to old creepy house where strange things happen caused by some probably violent event that had occurred in the place  is not. The main character's background  of course something terrible happened in her past too coming back to haunt her  is not. The shocks  chairs moving doors closing floors cracking  are not. The secret  did something violent happen to the couple who used to live here before Brittany Murphy's character  is not. I'm not going to comment on the ending but you see where this is going. The only gimmick is a video camera Murphy finds in the house with tapes that explain what happened here before. Well in the 70s they usually found tape recorders in those haunted houses as the home video market wasn't exactly booming back then. Just adding some new technology however doesn't make a story refreshing more so as the tapes  which take in a large part of the film  are uninteresting and didn't make me care what happened to Thora Birch's character. Murphy and Birch don't find much to do with their roles while Birch's psycho husband is rather annoying than menacing. the direction is not so much bad as just as uninspired as the story. Some scenes feel rather cheaply made without Murphy as the lead you could think you're watching a lowbudget madeforTV movie.".

The story has been done many times before and this wasn't a particularly good rendition of it. That's the main reason why the IMDb rating is so low. The filmmakers even seemed to get confused with the ending. They gave us a resolution but they hadn't quite worked out all the details.The film itself though was very well shot. They setup a creepy atmosphere from the very beginning and never let up. Subtle camera work kept up the same suspense level throughout. This film was made on a lowbudget and they made it well.Recommending this is tricky. I was faithfully terrified  not so much because of the storyline but because of what I was watching. Brittany Murphy was so pallid and anemic it was scary. And the atmosphere and slow moving camera shots were done so efficiently well significantly better than most horrorthrillers that I have seen.

I found that I could actually watch extended sections of this film in fast forward and not miss a plot point. This is because quite a few tension building scenes don't actually lead anywhere.

The performances are passable and the cinematography is adequate but the script is uninspired at best. The movie did keep me guessing till the end but only because I wasn't sure which clichd twist they were going to use. We've all seen the twist ending employed here before but when taken with the rest of this film it still almost seems nonsensical. And if you've ever seen a madeforTV thriller from the '80s you've heard the score before. Seriously listen to the music over the opening credits and try not to smile at that last line.

	schema:reviewBody "First off if really slow atmospheric films that don't have a lot of action bore you then this movie is NOT for you! Period. All you have to do is see the review here titled 'Snoozer with a Stupid Ending' Point proved well at least if not actually 'proven' strongly suggested   Here is the deal IF you are indeed going to make one of these really slow moody films that on the surface come across as super simple then you HAVE to do them well or forget it. The movie was beautifully photographed VERY well paced for the material and the acting was excellent. Do you realize how MANY frigg'n ways there are to screw something like this up? A lot! So I honestly felt that it was put together quite nicely.Now without spoiling anything I just wanna say that something that I really appreciated about this film is that this 'kind' of movie which you will understand sort of at the end USUALLY is very heavy handed with the 'reveal' in the sense that they usually make it blindingly obvious. However what I like about this one is that at the end yes something is strongly suggested BUT still things are left to be interpreted in a number of different ways as clearly seen in some of the discussion comments below which you should absolutely NOT read before seeing the movie! So basically like I said IF you like this kind of very slow moody film where there is a very good atmosphere that builds gradually and creates a good mystery and you don't necessarily NEED a lot of action or explanation THEN yes you should enjoy this movie...This film simply isn't for everyone. For example I'm quite sure that there are MANY people who absolutely LOVE the 'SAW' or 'HOSTEL' films quite the polar opposite of this film to be sure. So in that case I wouldn't feel right reviewing those films because that is just NOT my type of film at all. However the makers of 'SAW' went on to make a couple of excellent Horror films where people are NOT tortured or forced to do awful things that I totally loved! 'DEAD SILENCE'  'INSIDIOUS' I think it is the same with this one... Likely MOST of the people who have seen this movie and then come here and say 'Gee that was REALLY stupid and boring' would fall into the same category that it just isn't THEIR type of film that's all.The movie isn't WILDLY fantastic or anything just solidly well made as a matter of fact it really reminds me of another VERY similar film that I saw not long ago I can't remember the title right off But it was WAAAAAAAY more subtle than this one! It was similar where a woman seemed like it was a REALLY well known actress too perhaps Marisa Tomei someone like that... was staying in a remote house. And you just keep seeing this guy standing there in the room with her but she doesn't see him there are LONG periods without ANY dialog at all. It just about ALL is based on mood and atmosphere. It was great too but perhaps much more 'artistic' in it's approach and a bit more complex and layered in it's story than this one. This one here I would say was more directly psychological...But there is one thing I can promise you...This movie is indeed much MUCH better than it's current 4.x rating...".

For example I'm quite sure that there are MANY people who absolutely LOVE the 'SAW' or 'HOSTEL' films quite the polar opposite of this film to be sure. So in that case I wouldn't feel right reviewing those films because that is just NOT my type of film at all. However the makers of 'SAW' went on to make a couple of excellent Horror films where people are NOT tortured or forced to do awful things that I totally loved! 'DEAD SILENCE'  'INSIDIOUS' I think it is the same with this one... Likely MOST of the people who have seen this movie and then come here and say 'Gee that was REALLY stupid and boring' would fall into the same category that it just isn't THEIR type of film that's all.The movie isn't WILDLY fantastic or anything just solidly well made as a matter of fact it really reminds me of another VERY similar film that I saw not long ago I can't remember the title right off But it was WAAAAAAAY more subtle than this one! It was similar where a woman seemed like it was a REALLY well known actress too perhaps Marisa Tomei someone like that... was staying in a remote house. And you just keep seeing this guy standing there in the room with her but she doesn't see him there are LONG periods without ANY dialog at all. It just about ALL is based on mood and atmosphere. It was great too but perhaps much more 'artistic' in it's approach and a bit more complex and layered in it's story than this one. This one here I would say was more directly psychological...But there is one thing I can promise you...This movie is indeed much MUCH better than it's current 4.x rating...";

She then tried to drown her in the bath and killed the baby but not lucy. She has repressed this event. While in the house she relives the past only this time she is the victim not the perpetrator! She lives through what she did to her girlfriend lucy. When lucy gets to the house and sees alice has had a breakdown she promises she wont leave her again as she was about to leave the house when alice drowns her. She then sees her own necklace on alice neck. Later she sees she has wrote a book using the characters lucy and David. When lucy sees the video tape she is watching real footage of herself and alice who is David! Is that clear? The conversations alice has with ben and rebecca are in her head. In seeing the movie with this explanation i think it is really clever.".

I spent the last two days trying to figure this movie out. The way it ended it all made NO sense to me. Then as I was reading other reviews to see if anyone felt the same or if someone had understood it and explained. Thankfully someone did explain it. Sort of. It was more of a 'theory' but I'll go with it since it made sense to me after I thought about it. Basically Alice goes to the supposed creepy house to finish a screenplay her 'girlfriend' drops her off and then leaves. Alice starts seeinghearing weird things in the house. Alice finds a box of tapes and starts watching them. Uses them to write her screenplay. Witnesses a murder on it. Turns out a lot of what we saw happened in her head. She was reliving repressed events. After unfortunately remembering the movie Alice called Rebecca at one point and asked her to look up information on David and Lucy. At the end when Alice calls Rebecca again to tell her that David is in the house Rebecca has no idea what Alice is talking about and says I haven't talked to you in over a week I've been worried about you. And that leads me to believe that the conversation with Ben didn't happen. For one if Rebecca hadnt heard from Alice all week she didn't really tell Alice that Ben was out of jail. Which lead me to believe that Ben isn't really out of jail... And he couldn't have possibly known where Alice is nor could he have gotten her number.From what I gathered LucyRebecca AliceDavid... and Ben seems pretty unimportant...but maybe he plays Davids mom or the one that 'David' thought 'Lucy' was cheating on him with?

At the end of the movie Rebecca goes downstairs to look for David she finds only the video camera on the floor and on the tape she sees herself on a bed just like when Alice first found the tapes and it showed Lucy on the bed and David recording her.

I believe they were the former occupants of the house but we do not know what actually happened to them. When Alice found the tapes her fragile mind concocted the troubled relationship between the two to mirror her own troubled relationship with Ben. The fact that the first tape revealed Lucy's pregnancy fueled Alice's obsession with Lucy and David. The last tape which showed David drowning Lucy was a part of Alice's hallucinations. That's why Rebecca did not see the tape of the killing when she sat down to look at the video camera at the very end.The necklace with the name Lucy belonged to the real Lucy as did the dress and the high heels. Alice lost herself completely and was identifying with the Lucy in her imagination. She had been a victim of Ben's jealousy and anger and so Lucy also was a victim of David's jealousy and anger.The two phone calls between Alice and Rebecca never happened. Rebecca told Alice that she had not heard from her all week. She had no idea that things had gone horribly wrong. So the bit about Rebecca finding information about David Woods who drowned his wife and his mother reporting them both missing was a fabrication. I suspect it was a red herring to make viewers think that David was probably still in the house and stalking Alice by this point.Alice identified with Lucy as both were victims but she gave her imaginary David some of her characteristics. The obsession with filming their love interest it is implied that Alice and Rebecca were lovers and the bit about David having had a mental breakdown when Lucy had tried to break off their engagement. Alice had a mental breakdown when Ben tried to kill her. David's obsession with Lucy's supposed infidelity mirrored Ben's obsession but his fragile mental condition is also similar to Alice's.It's implied that David's obsession with Lucy mirrors Alice's obsession with Rebecca even though they haven't experienced any difficulties yet. At some point before going to the house Alice filmed Rebecca sleeping and made the comment about looking like an angel. Rebecca had just finished reading through Alice's screenplay. She had read about David doing the same thing and also about David's jealousy and rage. Rebecca was seriously creeped out when she saw the tape and the full impact of what she had read hit her and then the movie ended.When Alice received the phone call from Ben and he declared that he was going to leave her alone I believe that phone call also fueled her fantasy about David's mother coming in and saving him from suicide hanging. It was after the phone call from Ben where he said he was staying with his mother that Alice then came to the conclusion that David's mother saved him from hanging and then covered up his crime to protect him. She believed he had stayed in the house and then she lost herself completely in the Lucy persona and thought that David had tried to drown her too.In closing this was a great film and even more so very intelligent to those who like to think while watching films. I recommend this film to anyone who likes to think.".

Next were looking at an intense scene with Brit scoping out a small dark rm than the audio goes sky high at the fall of a chair making us jump out our seats. The scene abruptly ends  now were looking at Brit in bed waking up on a bright sunny morning like nothing happened. Why few directors like shooting those types of scenes is beyond me when those are the movies that flop. They had a good unique storyline with a good killer twist but messed that up at the very end when they suddenly attempted to take it in a LAME  senseless direction. I guess it was meant to be a 2nd outtheblue killer twist at the end but instead it left everyone moaning in disappointment complaining about how weak the movie was etc etc. It would have been a half a decent storyline if they would have showed the killer's body proving that Brit's character was telling the truth which was the original twist.

	schema:reviewBody "I got a chance to rent Deadline last night and I was pleasantly surprised. Deadline is the kind of movie that relies on a sense of dread and atmosphere instead of shocking effects and a display of gratuitous gore in place of genuine scares. It conveys an eeriness that sets it apart from all the other recent movies in this genre. Brittany Murphy and Thora Birch reveal an haunting fragility and vulnerability that suit their characters' pale features and haunted countenance. The story one that explores the fine line between love and obsession sanity and insanity what's real and what's not leaves a lasting imprint in the mind of the viewer and a subsequent thoughtful reflective summation on our past relationships that covered the same territory or at least could have.The cinematography is really beautiful confident and composed. The poignant classic score elevates the movie to a level way above its modest budget which according to IMDb was under 2 million. I felt there could have been less score at times but it creates a powerful emotion at the very end when we realize the extent of Alice's descent into madness. It feels as though the screenplay wasn't developed as well as it could have been as I felt the characters were a little two dimensional at times and there are a few clichs that could have been avoided yet it's compelling viewing and really picks up when the B. Murphy character discovers the box of tapes and goes on to investigate the mystery in the house. Overall the execution is really admirable and there are moments of sheer cinematic beauty as when the B. Murphy slowly goes down the stairs in an eerie ghostly manner to the haunting Moonlight Sonata concerto by Ludwig Van Beethoven. I don't know if it was the director's intention but at times it reminded me of A. Hitckock's movies such as Rebecca or Vertigo. It's elegant classy and if you love intelligent atmospheric slow burners like The Orphanage or The Others then go and rent it.".

Her producer arranged for AliceMurphyto stay at the isolated locale of a missing couple who lived there. Thora Birch is Lucy Alice's muse after discovering some camcorder tapes shot by her disturbed husband DavidMarc Blucas. David is insecure about his standing with Lucy who tries her very level best to tell her husband that he is her one and only. Yet David can not accept that such a lovely creature as Lucy could be all his and we witness their marriage's unraveling as she prepares a room for the birth of their child. David is obsessive in recording Lucy's practically every movement and it becomes so consuming she tells him he's smothering her..Lucy is painting a baby chair or brushing her hair and there's David with that damn camera recording every move she makes. This is ideal for Alice though with enough material to work with that their life and it's spiral into darkness provides her with a juicy story which could fashion into a provocative screenplay. Though as Alice begins hearing creaks noises sobbing and other sounds she wonders if the house is haunted by Lucy further concerned about the whereabouts of David. Tammy Blanchard is Rebecca Alice's companion and we assumelesbian lover. Rebecca worries for Alice's mental state particularly when phone calls from her reveal that she sees and hears Lucyand other strange goingsonaround the house. DEADLINE questions whether or not Alice is actually experiencing what she does or if these events regarding Lucy and David are merely parallels to her past trauma with Ben. We start to notice that Alice and Lucy merge in scenes as if both lives mirror each other. DEADLINE is a slowburning oldfashioned chiller using isolation and psychological damage as a means to tell it's tale of a seriously tormented protagonist. Through Murphy's haunted characterher face conveys instability and vulnerability in essence Alice has a fragile psyche barely held together with duck tape. There's never a point in the movie where Alice is shown as mentally strong and if anything the past wears on her face and demeanor almost at all times. Being alone in a house with a possible history of murder maybe wasn't the right thing to do for such a fractured soul as Alice. Rebecca tries bless her heart to be an ear for Alice and wants to help her but there's too much baggage thanks to Ben. Ben is never shown on screen but I felt David is a reminder of him..my opinion Ben and David are one in the same. Though Ben actually contacts Alice telling her she is free will this poor victim ever be liberated from the horrors of the past? What DEADLINE does effectively is follow what seems like a cordial harmonious marriage disintegrate with Alice unhealthily watching it deteriorate. The ending however is rather fascinating in that it shows Alice perhaps switching roles as Rebecca finds a recording of herself asleep a statement eerily reminding us of what David said as he was taping Lucy dozing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will not bother to recount the story  it is a familiar one I'll just mention the good points of the movie 1 Brittany Murphy does an excellent job  she is pretty fearless going in the attic numerous times not getting creeped out by the old house noises is convincing as she gets wrapped up in the story of the prior residents as observed by the husband's extensive videotaping  which Brittany finds 2 good use of less is more approach to filming the build up to the climax  very good creepy music  set an atmosphere of dread  punctuated by the woman screaming which did not seem to bother Ms. Murphy  it sure would have me 3. maddening ambiguity  did the guys wife Lucy actually have an affair with Luke? she never denies it  keeps repeating We're having our baby  as if that would stop her. The ending has a couple of twists and some possibly disturbing aftermath to the events. One other reviewer thought that the writers thought some of this up at the last minute  I agree. The bad too coincidental that Brittany and the woman in the house had similar circumstances  they did not have to do that to make it interesting. Also Brittany was there to write but in the whole movie I did not see her write a word  so I think the title is just an excuse or afterthought to the plot.

The ending has a couple of twists and some possibly disturbing aftermath to the events. One other reviewer thought that the writers thought some of this up at the last minute  I agree. The bad too coincidental that Brittany and the woman in the house had similar circumstances  they did not have to do that to make it interesting. Also Brittany was there to write but in the whole movie I did not see her write a word  so I think the title is just an excuse or afterthought to the plot. They had to get her to the house by herself in some way.One other good thing  the subtle undertones that Brittany and her roommate were more than just friends.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this with my family on German television and it did for us what we expected it to do. A bit of thrill and suspense interesting atmosphere and the urge to watch it until the end because you want to know who makes it out of the mess.If you expect an original cleverly constructed plot absence of clich and blood and gore this might be the wrong film for you.The plot is clearly constructed at times to create the situations the filmmakers were aiming for. Clichs are waiting around pretty much every corner of that creepy ship. And the violence is almost never shown directly a benefit for someone like me who is not into that kind of thing. The main element of horror is the ship and the inhumanity.Another letdown are the underdeveloped characters. If you follow the Spanish movie scene a bit you will recognise some of the actors and know that they are in fact quite excellent. Especially the wonderful Llus Homar the captain 'La Mala educacin' and charismatic youngster Andrs Gertrdix Edgar 'The Orphanage' are severely underemployed by the scrip and direction. Just rare intimate moments like Edgar's tearful look of sadness at his friend Ivn who is about to face up the ship's crew which probably means certain death as shown earlier in the movie give you a hint at how interesting the exploit of emotions and relationships between the characters could have been.Which leads to another letdown which would be the unconvincing 'relationship' the filmmakers want to force Ivn and Sara into. Yesyes we know the heroine and the soon to become hero need to end up with each other but do we really want them to? No. Because there is zero chemistry between the actors. You don't even know why on earth these two should fall for each other. The only convincing connection of friendship and love is between the young couple Victor and Thais and between Ivn and Edgar. In fact we all ended up rooting for Ivn to end up with his friend Edgar instead of with Sara. A theory that is not even that absurd given the level of homoerotic vibes between the two characters something for the ladies who are into that kind of undertones. If you think of the conversation going on right before Edgar's declaration of love you might wonder as well if the writers were cackling to themselves in a corner about that little twist.Additionally there are logical flaws like the walkietalkie suddenly being on receptionmode but I have to correct one of my fellow writers who said the movie was suddenly switching from night to midday. It begins on midday and ends in the morning of the following day. There is clearly some dawnearly morning light situation towards the end before the sun comes out.And I liked that the movie does not follow the rules of who should die first and how likable or dislikable the villains victims or survivors should be. Nor do I mind the characters changing their attitude without the usual Hollywood movie intheface explanation and monologue. That is how humans are. They are irrational and don't necessarily announce to the world when they experience a change of mind just to let the movie audience know. So in a way the characters are acting more natural and human than those in your usual teeny horror flick that leaves no room for surprises where you always know what kind of character you are dealing with.Overall an average thriller with a good atmosphere which makes you mourn for all it could have been because it gives you glimpses of all its wasted potential.".

Basically it boils down to I liked it I recommend it.";

The movie's set in Vermont but the script contains references to rednecks...c'mon how seriously can you take that? Lighten up everyone. This isn't a Steven Seagal movie!Here's an example.

All the standard 80s clichs are there. I could just imagine someone like Van Damme or Stallone playing the lead. Instead we have Billy Ray Cyrus. And to my utter amazement Cyrus is not the biggest weakness in the movie. In fact I'd say he's one of the few bright spots. As I've already alluded to the biggest problem comes from a tired clich filled plot that brings absolutely nothing new to the action genre. A loner on a motorcycle arrives in a new town and takes a job tending bar. He immediately runs into trouble with the local gun runner's son when the son's girl takes an interest in the new guy. He's an exNavy Seal at least I think he is who manages to fight off a halfdozen thugs. He's eventually beatdown and goes into hiding. The girl nurses him back to health and the pair fall in love. Together they bring down the baddies. Sound familiar?Other low points include poor fight choreography a remixed Achy Breaky Heart and mostly bad acting.

I think I saw the title mullet wrangler in the end credits.

There is also the standard abandoned warehouse scene silly twists in the plot that make no sense and a curious lack of action. There is even a counter that appears on screen from time to time reminding you in army time how much time has passed on his mission. The viewer despairs at how little time has actually passed. Why would the filmmakers rub that in? When you are watching Radical Jack at times it dawns on you that I am WATCHING RADICAL JACK.

	schema:reviewBody "When Billy Ray Cyrus burst on the Country Music scene in 1992 with Achy Breaky Heart he immediately became a hot property. With smoldering good looks and an imposing physique he had real star quality. Cyrus had been a champion athlete in school and his 6' frame still sculpted with muscle and some badass ink made him a natural for action movies like Radical Jack. The plot was pretty simple  Jack an exNavy SEAL goes undercover in a hick town to bust an arms seller falls in love with the innocent girlfriend of the head bad guy and leaves a trail of bodies at the end. Wisely they used this thin storyline to showcase Cyrus both as a fighter and a lover. With his trademark mullet morphed into movie star locks and his sleeves rolled up to display his big tattooed arms Billy Ray's transformation into a redneck sex symbol is quickly established.Billy Ray hits town and immediately crosses swords with Rolland played by Noah Blake. The smooth Blake is a good foil for Cyrus he's leaner more polished but his muscular body and martial arts skills are clearly deadly. He has a posse of goons chief among them the familiar Rusty De Wees who has made a career out of playing backwoods enforcers. Add to the mix a couple of crooked cops and you can see early on that Billy Ray will have his work cut out for him.Along with punch ups and beat downs there's a budding romance between Cyrus and Kate DeDee Pfeiffer. We first see Kate in a sex scene with Rolland she's topless he's in boxers and socks but it's only a prelude to her breakup with him. When Jack shows up Kate falls hard and we get to see her seducing him in a steamy bed scene where both bodies are on display. Sex actually plays a big role in this movie. When a crooked cop's wife threatens the arms deal another officer is sent to silence her but he takes time to bed her first before pulling the trigger. Inevitably we also get a scene where Rolland's lovemaking gets heavy handed and Kate's black eye and swollen lip lead to Jack vowing to kill Rolland.Along with the sex there's plenty of fighting. Cyrus has ample opportunity to show off with martial arts moves and two fisted punching. Rolland never runs out of goons for him to put away  some of them permanently. Cyrus finally gets a beatdown of his own from De Wees and a dozen hillbilly musclemen but that just gives Kate an excuse to nurse him back to health in her bedroom where Billy Ray  naked except for a pair of flimsy drawstring pants  gets treated to some tender loving care. In the end Jack makes sure all the bad guys meet an appropriate end. In an orgy of gun violence Jack slays every thug in sight. De Wees's muscles don't do him any good against the exSEAL and though Jack promised Kate he would off Rolland for manhandling her she does the honors herself by putting a bullet in his head.As an action movie Radical Jack didn't break any new ground but as a vehicle to showcase big bad Billy Ray Cyrus it did a great job. Cyrus went on to star in a number of TV shows but never made another shoot 'em up action movie  too bad.".

Cyrus finally gets a beatdown of his own from De Wees and a dozen hillbilly musclemen but that just gives Kate an excuse to nurse him back to health in her bedroom where Billy Ray  naked except for a pair of flimsy drawstring pants  gets treated to some tender loving care. In the end Jack makes sure all the bad guys meet an appropriate end. In an orgy of gun violence Jack slays every thug in sight. De Wees's muscles don't do him any good against the exSEAL and though Jack promised Kate he would off Rolland for manhandling her she does the honors herself by putting a bullet in his head.As an action movie Radical Jack didn't break any new ground but as a vehicle to showcase big bad Billy Ray Cyrus it did a great job. Cyrus went on to star in a number of TV shows but never made another shoot 'em up action movie  too bad.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was praised to be hilarious and a parody of all of these Vietnam war movies so i got a grip on the original DVD and watched it. The hopes were pushed really high by the texts in the advertisements but as i am familiar with amateurmovie productions i did not take these lines that serious because most of them are only added to push the marketing. As this is a complete amateur production i even won't say its a bmovie. Simply because it does not reach that level.The first thing i noticed was that there were scenes taken from other movies and put into this one the helicopter ones which you can easily notice on the massive picture quality difference. Second thing i noticed was that the audio and video were about .2 to .3 seconds asynchronous which i count as a major minus. The rifle shots and explosions are all digitally put in after wards but they look nice for an amateur movie. I think they did that because you can't simply detonate explosives in a German forest without permission. The forest looked pretty good and also the soldiers equipment was well done so thats a plus.The characters in the movie are shallow and fit the usual stereotypes not even mentioning the acting which was in my opinion... brutal to look at. Don't expect anything from that part. Sometimes its embarrassing how desperately they try to fulfill that stereotypes.Together with the fact that i did not have to laugh for a single time during the whole movie there was not even a grin on my face because it is simply not funny at all made me think how to get back the hour i wasted with this movie.So i recommend it only for hardcore trash fans. Everyone else stay away.".

There are no speaking actors yet the hearing viewer isn't lost because there are voice overs. I was shocked at the attention to detail. There are great camera angles a good plot interesting characters and just a lot of plain old good times! This is a twist on the classic Dracula films that works so well. It has all the shock value and drama needed to make it the classic B as well as the cheese factor that makes you fall in love with it. I adore this movie and am so grateful to a friend for giving it me. I've never seen anything like it and apparently never will again being as it currently is the first and only deaf based movie.

After seeing the Danish Nicolas Winding Refn's hardcore Pushertrilogy this German effort seems almost like an ambitious schoolproject that just lacked the budget andor passion to make it better. It's a shame because it seems like the makers really had an important message they wanted to convey but in the end it didn't really come through as strong as they probably would have wanted.Overall a decent story for a short feature but stretched into full featurefilm length it just seems prolonged and gets a bit boring after a while.

	schema:reviewBody "Dealer is a German film from 1999 so it will soon have its 20th anniversary. The writer and director is Thomas Arslan who recently made some waves with his 2013 film Gold with Nina Hoss. But this one we have here is among his early career efforts. You can see the talent here and there but as a whole he was still far from his best. Just like some other works from Arslan's early years this one here was fairly short namely not even 75 minutes and this already includes credits. Lead actor is Tamer Yigit and he is certainly less known today as some of his coactors. Birol nel who plays a cop and Idil ner who plays the main characters girlfriend have made it big afterward mostly thanks to Faith Akin but also to their talent of course. The rest of the cast here I am not familiar with at all. It is a mix of German and Turkish actors.This is the story of a young man who gets deeper and deeper into the world of crime drug dealing etc. and cannot seem to stay away from it despite trying on some occasions. Not even the efforts to help him by a police officer and his girlfriend contribute anything positive to the protagonist's mindset almost the opposite. I think the best thing here is that the film feels very realistic from start to finish and does not include any forced happy moments or even a forced happy ending. But all in all the bad is just more significant. I never felt that Arslan made the most of the story and its potential. Another problem is that the line delivery felt extremely wooden at times and while the actors did a good job on many occasions too these weak moments from the cast hurt the movie a lot as it took all the flow out of the story. Eventually I must say I am glad this one was so short. But I am also disappointed because it's obvious that there is some decent potential here in everybody and this potential was not even close in being fulfilled referring to the script and cast. Thumbs down from me. Not recommended.".

Yet I must say that La Via Della Droga aka. The Heroin Busters of 1977 is a more than worthwhile Poliziottesco that no genrelover should consider missing. The multitalented Exploitation mastermind Enzo G. Castellari in the director's chair a cast including Fabio Testi and David Hemmings loads of violent shootouts and a score by Goblin  what else could a fan of Italian genre cinema ask for? Fabio Testi plays drug smuggler Fabio who is arrested when trying to get a considerable amount of heroin into Rome. After escaping from jail and obtaining the trust of a local druglord Joshua Sinclair Fabio turns out to be in fact an undercover cop who works together with international drug squad officer Mike Hamilton David Hemmings. Determined to rid Rome of Heroin Fabio and Mike are also willing to use unorthodox methods... While La Via Della Droga is certainly no Poliziotteschi highlight en par with Almost Human or Rome Armed To The Teeth this is a film that should not be missed by a genre fan. Whereas the storyline is not the best ever the film is full of violent shootouts carchases occasional sleaze and stylish brutality. I've personally been a great fan of Enzo G. Castellari for years sadly enough I still haven't seen his supposedly best Poliziotteschi La Polizia Incrimina La Legge Assolve aka. High Crime 1973 and Il Cittadino Si Ribella Street LawThe Citizen Rebels 1974. La Via Della Droga however is more than a bit entertaining and if the two aforementioned films are even better I can't wait to see them. I am also a great fan of both leading men both of whom have starred in personal Giallofavorites of mine David Hemmings in Dario Argento's Profondo Rosso Fabio Testi in Massimo Dallamano's What Have You Done To Solange and both are once again excellent in their roles. Especially Testi does a great job as the hero here while Hemmings' role could have been bigger. Joshua Sinclair Keoma also makes a good villain. My only real complaint is that I would have wished for David Hemmings to have more screen time. The score by Progressive Rock band Goblin is great as always even though it comes nowhere near the brilliance of the scores they did for Dario Argento's masterpieces. All in all La Via Della Droga is a more than recommendable Poliziottesco that my fellow fans of Italian Crime cinema should enjoy.".

	schema:headline " starts off slow but this Fabio TestiDavid Hemmings eurocrime film eventually delivers the goods";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw this film many years ago I was put off by its slow and fragmented first ten minutes featuring scenes of gratuitous! drug use in various parts of the world. Also I had just seen David Hemmings' other Italian crime film from this year SWINDLE with Tomas Milian directed by Bruno Corbucci which was INCREDIBLE and this did not seem as good. However once the film kicks into gear after fifteen minutes or so it is quite good and features some incredible stunt work imaginative action sequences exciting guitardriven music from Goblin not as repetitive as some of their work a wonderful overthetop performance by David Hemmings as an interpol narcotics investigator and a cool smoldering performance by Fabio Testi as an undercover cop out to bust the international drug trade. As a later 70s product this film features unnecessary closeup shots of drug use and some gratuitous nudity a lesbian scene presented as a FANTASY of a minor character! but there's not enough of either to derail what becomes a nailbiting action film. The final fifteen to twenty minutes of HEROIN BUSTERS are incrediblethe motorcycle chase in the subway which leads into an outrageous airplane chasesome of the most interesting and daredevil actionfilm stuntwork I've seen in a while. The film also has nice bursts of humor here and there such as when Hemmings chasing a crook gets a ride from a young lady on a motorcycle and has to grab on to her breast to hold on! and was quite satisfying on all levels. It does start slow however so don't give up on it or fast forward through some of the initial scenes. What a golden age of Italian crime films the 1970's waseven a standard genre entry turns out to be a gem the likes of which would NEVER be made today.".

It's ridiculous hopelessly convoluted but always entertaining. Castellari is a master at this type of film and he's in top form. Hemmings is a tad too tightly wound but he has great chemistry with Fabio Testi ideally cast as a deep undercover cop. The sometimes intrusive popsynth score by frequent Argento collaborator Goblin could have been toned down but it's a minor flaw in this classic. Sherry Buchanan plays a junkie.

	schema:reviewBody "This crime thriller tells the story of an undercover cop Fabio Testi who has to play a drug dealer so that the real dealers accept him as a member of their syndicate and he can come close to the big men at the top of the syndicate. As it is the problem with many genre films of its decade the depiction of the drug dealers their environments and the investigating methods of the undercover cop looks clichd and hilariously out of date. Except for that this is a highly entertaining action packed film.Fabio Testi never looks like a real drug dealer but who cares his acting is solid as ever. David Hemmings as the police inspector who knows about Testi's true identity brings English flair to the role with his sometimes almost exaggerated British accent. The supporting cast consists of many faces familiar from other Italian genre outings e.g. the ruthless syndicate killer in Lucio Fulci's Luca il Contrabbandiere from 1981 also starring Testi in the lead role and the score by the at that time Argento regulars Goblin just rocks. There are some quite original action sequences especially the climax in which director Enzo Girolami delivers a plane chase for once instead of a car chase and this plane chase looks daring sometimes. Because the simple plot always pushes the action forward the movie never becomes boring and delivers.Certainly not Enzo Girolami's best film his La Polizia Incrimina la Legge Assolve is probably the best Italian crime film ever made mainly because the story is never really convincing but it's fast paced and will please every fan of Italian crime thrillers.".

A must see especially for fans of euro crime. In this movie Fabio Testi plays an officer who goes deep cover in the heroin game to try and take out the big boys of the operation. Only one cop is aware of the undercover op so this movie is basically Testi vs. the world with one cop on his side. The action in this movie continues from beginning to end and the question is continually asked who is more of a threat to Fabio the heroin dealers he is trying to bust or his fellow police officers who believe him to be another drug dealing son of a bitch?!".

	schema:reviewBody "You can always rely on Enzo Castellari to knock things up a notch and even though he had me worried and a little confused at the pacing of this one it all leads up to major kick ass ending. After the film seemingly randomly shifts between Hong Kong Amsterdam Colombia and New York the film finally settles in Rome as we see Fabio Testi getting busted for carrying drugs into the country. At the same time and in the same place another guy who's just arrived from Amsterdam is tailed by cop David Hemmings who gets duped by the dealers as big old Romano Puppo gets away with the goods. Yep Hemmings is hot headed pottymouthed cop out to take down a huge drug cartel and he's the only guy who knows that Fabio Testi is an undercover cop. Things get pretty difficult for Testi as he works his way into the dealer's trust via a junky guy with his own sub plot and nothing ends up going to plan as everything results in a huge chase at the end that uses feet motorbikes and finally planes. I think there's a deep meaning to all this and that is If you deal drugs Fabio Testi will shoot you.You've got the usual Enzo back up crew here Massimo Vanni who does his 'riding a bike downstairs' bit Joshua Sinclair as a suave dealer Romano Puppo as another dealer and even Enzo himself turns up to mug for the camera. Sherry Buchanan turns up as the junky guy's girlfriend but she really just turns up to be naked for a minute or two.I found it strange that there's an obvious stunt double doing even the most routine of stunts for Fabio but then it's Fabio himself doing all that crazy crap with the planes later. I did burst out laughing when a guy pulled a particularly strange face when getting shot in slow motion. It does seem however that Enzo is kind of making some sort of comment about the hippy life being dead and leading to horrible addiction because the drug taking here is shown in all its glory and when you see a guy licking spilled heroin from a toilet seat it doesn't exactly entice you to go take the stuff. Well done Enzo!".

Things get pretty difficult for Testi as he works his way into the dealer's trust via a junky guy with his own sub plot and nothing ends up going to plan as everything results in a huge chase at the end that uses feet motorbikes and finally planes. I think there's a deep meaning to all this and that is If you deal drugs Fabio Testi will shoot you.You've got the usual Enzo back up crew here Massimo Vanni who does his 'riding a bike downstairs' bit Joshua Sinclair as a suave dealer Romano Puppo as another dealer and even Enzo himself turns up to mug for the camera. Sherry Buchanan turns up as the junky guy's girlfriend but she really just turns up to be naked for a minute or two.I found it strange that there's an obvious stunt double doing even the most routine of stunts for Fabio but then it's Fabio himself doing all that crazy crap with the planes later. I did burst out laughing when a guy pulled a particularly strange face when getting shot in slow motion. It does seem however that Enzo is kind of making some sort of comment about the hippy life being dead and leading to horrible addiction because the drug taking here is shown in all its glory and when you see a guy licking spilled heroin from a toilet seat it doesn't exactly entice you to go take the stuff. Well done Enzo!";

	schema:reviewBody "There were a lot of good Dirty Harry inspired cop films made in Italy during the seventies and while The Heroin Busters isn't one of the best of them  it's still a damn fine example of this sort of film. By far the best thing about Italian Dirty Harry ripoffs is the entertainment value and The Heroin Busters delivers that in spades! Granted it's a bit slow to start though never boring but once the film kicks into action properly it comes thick and fast and the film includes one of the best action sequences I've seen in a film like this  that being the one that sees Fabio Testi being chased through a construction site. As the title suggests this is a film that bases its plot around drugs. Apparently drugs are being trafficked around the world from Rome and police chief Mike Hamilton decides to do something about it by having Fabio go undercover as a drug dealer. This requires him to immerse himself in the criminal underworld with the intention being to get close to the lower level criminals so that he can eventually catch the big guns at the top.The film features a great pair of central performances from David Hemmings and Fabio Testi. This is undoubtedly one of the best things about the film as both of their performances are excellent and they offset each other brilliantly. Testi is great in the 'action hero' role as he fits the bill perfectly and does a great job with the action scenes also. Hemmings is at the other end of the spectrum with his role as the police chief but he does just great also and it's great seeing these two together. The music comes courtesy of Dario Argento's house band Goblin and while their work on this film doesn't rival the stuff they did for Argento The Heroin Busters certainly isn't lacking in the music department. The film is directed by Enzo G. Castellari who directed a couple of well revered crime flicks before this one including the excellent 'The Big Racket'. The film features a few big set pieces and the climax which takes the form of a plane chase is a more than fitting finale to an audacious crime extravaganza. This isn't as good as Italian crime flicks get  but it's not bad at all and comes highly recommended!".

The Heroin Busters gets off to a good start with a opening credit sequence featuring a montage of scenes highlighting drug trafficking in Hong Kong Columbia and Rome set to some nice 80s actionstyle music. The action sequences in The Heroin Busters are good but the promised motorcycle and airplane chase big finale wasn't all that I had been led to believe it would be. It's good but it ran a little too long for me. The action sequence immediately preceding the supposed big finish where Fabio Testi is being chased through the construction site is easily one of my favorite moments in the film. On the acting side both Testi and David Hemmings are fine in their roles and I especially enjoyed the few scenes they had together. Few being the key word as I would have liked more shared screen time between the two. Finally I never really bought the notion of Testi as a drug dealer. I knew something was up as soon as he came on screen.".

We have the man in some scenes looking uncannily like Robert Smith of The Cure hanging out inside the wall commenting on the goingson and we have our various victims that just cant resist the comfort of this mystical bed.This is no ordinary bed. No sirree Bob! Not only does it eat people but it cleans up after itself draws the covers back and it even makes itself. Who wouldn't want a bed like that? It can even use its sheets as a rudimentary lasso to wrangle escaped victims back in especially if they're taking up half the length of the film to try and escape.Our main story if you can call it that is about these three girls who go out to this remote area to housesit??. I don't recall exactly but it doesn't really matter though as there are plenty of things that defy convention that you just have to give in and accept. The dialogue in the film is like no other the characters talk to each other seemingly by telepathy as their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo. One of our girls believes she isn't liked by the rest of the gang and makes sure to tell us all her feelings on this matter through an echoey voiceover but we don't care character development was thrown out the window a LONG time before in this film so why start now? There are scenes when the bed laughs snores crunches and makes various other noises that we assume judging by our cast's nonreaction to said noises cant be heard. This and the telepathy makes the issue of diegesis very difficult to ascertain...but thats OK....this is Death Bed The Bed That Eats and it defies all logic so its OK. It makes for a lush dreamy quality to this most bizarre film If you buy hehe buy...did I say buy? this DVD make sure to check out the introduction by the director. He explains that the filming of this flick started in 1972 didn't wrap up until 1977 he shopped it for a few years with no luck and then fast forward 26 years to 2003 it gets released on DVD. Supposedly someone somewhere had a print of this in some other country and made bootleg after bootleg of it and it was quite by chance on a message board no less that our director found evidence that people knew and gasp! cared about his littleknown film. Its from there that he decided to give it a shot and release it. I'm glad he did. Once you've even so much as heard the title to this film you MUST see it.

This is in my opinion one of the greatest B movies i've ever seen. Now it's not for every one.Granted it's not even for most people. As a matter of fact i suspect their are only going to be a handful of us who truly enjoy this movie.For those of you who like B movies though this film is a Diamond in the rough. It has a great premise A bed... That eat's people. It doesn't walk it doesn't move it doesn't have a siren call to attract people. It pretty much relies on people wandering by and sitting on it.I loved every inch of this movie and have already seen it three times in the scant weeks i've owned it.Like I said After reading the title of the film You already know if you'll like it. If you laughed or smiled Then give it a go. it's worth it.".

I stumbled across this gem at Best Buy the other day and picked it up for Ten Bucks. I got ten bucks worth of enjoyment out of the title and the box alone.I'm a huge fan of B movies. This is in my opinion one of the greatest B movies i've ever seen. Now it's not for every one.Granted it's not even for most people. As a matter of fact i suspect their are only going to be a handful of us who truly enjoy this movie.For those of you who like B movies though this film is a Diamond in the rough. It has a great premise A bed... That eat's people. It doesn't walk it doesn't move it doesn't have a siren call to attract people. It pretty much relies on people wandering by and sitting on it.I loved every inch of this movie and have already seen it three times in the scant weeks i've owned it.Like I said After reading the title of the film You already know if you'll like it. If you laughed or smiled Then give it a go. it's worth it.";

This is explained to us by one of the bed's victims a painter whose soul is trapped inside one of his last works the artistic rendering of the his final resting place..he was dying of consumption coughing up blood deciding to die on the death bed. You see the painter who we are able to see as if he were trapped in a small room looking through his painting unfortunately a spectator to the bed's meals. The bed has a dark sense of humor and we see this through it's allowing the painter to live even giving him jewelry and other possessions once owned by eaten victims.

The film features three young women who come across the mansion which holds the basement containing the death bed.

In one of the film's most demented scenes Russ attempts to stab the bed only for his hands to get caught in it's grip the flesh acidified with only skeletal bones remaining the cartilage deteriorating. There's one lengthly attempted escape by a victim whose legs were caught in the bed almost out of the basement when it's sheets snatched her back into it's belly where she belonged. The film feels almost completely surreal as if we were watching a macabre nightmare unfold. Director George Barry often features gags regarding the victims who find themselves in the most unfortunate position choosing the death bed as their place of refuge..the painter gives us a recollection of all the various people who were eaten.

But something feels constantly offkilter and the story seems to glide sleepily from one scene to the next even when indulging in cheap laughs or strange gore effects. Imagine Bunel crossed with Bergman then left to soak in a big vat of Herschell Gordon Lewis.

	schema:headline " The strangest bedtime story ever told";
	schema:reviewBody "Honestly this is one of the strangest movies I ever saw. It felt like absolutely surreal dreamlike cult film. At the edge of a grand estate near a crumbling old mansion lies a strange stone building with just a single room. In the room there lies a bed. The major imaginative thrive of the movie is that it is narrated by the Victorian artist Aubrey Beardsley who is held captive inside the wall behind one of his paintings next to the bed. Born of demonic power the bed seeks the flesh blood and life essence of unwary travelers. My favorite victim in the film was the gangster who tries to shoot the bed with his gun as if that will help. Well three girls then arrive on vacation searching for a place to spend the night and find themselves sleeping on the bed that eats people. George Barry's uniquely weird journey into horror through a world of carnivorous furnishings was a bit out of this world! Comedian Patton Oswalt once quote that this movie was one of the most awesome movies he ever saw. By watching it I can clearly say he might be putting a bit of a sarcasm tone into that. Still it was pretty entertaining. Who knows a bed can drink Pepto Bismo fried chicken and orange soda?! The bed can also make flowers grow out of a skull lock doors give jewelry to dead people and even masturbates for some odd reason. This movie is a true testament that every horrible idea for an objectbased horror movie has been nearly done. I wasn't scare at all but laughing. The movies take itself so serious but for me it felt like a comedy horror. It could have been better with a better writer. The concept is good. Truly a bed that eats people can be scary in the right hands. A good example of that is 1984's Nightmare on Elm Street with what happens to Johnny Depp's character. In this film the writing is a lengthy monotonous rather incomprehensible story related by the ghost about twothirds of the way through the film about how the bed came to be a bed that eats people. There is another strange series of scenes displaying a woman inside an underground coffin on the estate of the cottage and nearby mansion that I have yet to figure out how it fits into the story. The gore effects in this movie were pretty bad. I like how you can clearly see where the pins connect one fake bone to the other on the clearly fake skeleton hand on the guy after the bed eat him. The sound mix is a bit annoying. The acting is dreadful. The actor who speaks Beardsley's voice is a little bit better than the other cast. His pacing accent and inflections are hypnotic alright. Pay attention if you buy this the dad from Boy meets world is in this as one of the characters brothers. In fact I'm more awestruck by the fact that they started shooting in 1972 and took 5 years to finish this movie. Then nobody would release it for two more decades after its completion. When it finally came out according to the DVD extras Barry seems to have even forgotten he made it. It's one of those movies so bad it's good. So give it a try and sleep on it.".

The sound mix is a bit annoying. The acting is dreadful. The actor who speaks Beardsley's voice is a little bit better than the other cast. His pacing accent and inflections are hypnotic alright. Pay attention if you buy this the dad from Boy meets world is in this as one of the characters brothers. In fact I'm more awestruck by the fact that they started shooting in 1972 and took 5 years to finish this movie. Then nobody would release it for two more decades after its completion. When it finally came out according to the DVD extras Barry seems to have even forgotten he made it. It's one of those movies so bad it's good. So give it a try and sleep on it.";

	schema:reviewBody "It was a particular killer podcast wink wink nod nod that brought my attention to the George Barry 1977 lost horror film Death Bed The Bed That Eats. I had never heard of the film previous and any mention in conversation over beds that cause death I would immediately recall Johnny Depp's fate in A Nightmare on Elm Street.My curiosity was peaked with the premise. It sounded as ridiculous as Rubber 2010 possibly as outlandish as El Topo 1970 so it was a quick and easy purchase as I turned to Amazon to add to my collection.Death Bed is simply that. The plot surrounds a bed that eats. Our interest is mainly in the humans to which it consumes but apples bottles of wine and even a Pepto Bismol container are all part of the bed's diet throughout the 77minute running time. It eats through an acidic sudsy substance that overtakes objects laid upon it's mattress.The bed is fittingly located in a remote area of the countryside and we learn of its history and its thoughts ? through the narration of a spirit that is imprisoned within a painting kept in the same room as the killer furniture piece.Mostly the bed feasts upon travelers and more specifically during the midchapters on three vacationing women searching for a bed for the night.We could not ascertain whether writerdirectorproducer George Barry was looking to make a serious film or if he instead had designs on cinematic glory. But considering the film's overall tones and serious approach to the ridiculous premise we would suggest the intention was sincere. And with adult moments that included various scenes incorporating female nudity our case is that much furthered.Our appreciation for Death Bed The Bed That Eats might be more of a surprise than the film's plot points. We appreciated the movie for what it attempted and we enjoyed the crunching and munching Mr. King Size did on his adventures. Screened in 2013 we could hardly take it seriously. But it was with a satiric eye opened that we were kept entertained and we understood the cult epic that was unfolding in line with Eraserhead and Pink Flamingos.Yes even at under 80minutes the idea runs its course and outstays its welcome. And yes there were holes larger than pillowcases that brought out the WTF in us while screening.Still the title of the film doesn't hide what George Barry was trying to create. Our world might not be better having watched it but we are glad we now have a new conversation piece at parties that is designed to garner attention.www.killerreviews.com".

I know that term is overused but it couldn't be truer than it is here. This truly beggars description. It is a horror comedy as well as art filmhorror hybrid. But the whole thing is so surreal it must be seen. The score sounds like the electronic bits from an old Candlemass album the acting is terrible and disconnected from everything the direction is surprisingly competent and the movie at times feels like a Jesus Franco moviethat is if his movies were intentionally funny.In the end there really is no proper way to describe this movie. Lord knows I've tried but really few movies are as odd unique or mind boggling as this is. See it...but you've been warned. This is also the only movie George Berry has ever done. He definitely left his mark on the exploitation genre with this I'll tell you that much.".

DEATH BED has many recognizable elements of thepast but displays a wholly unique and original storyline.As a story DEATH BED is an amazingly simple yet originalvision something which only oneinathousand independent releases will manage to accomplish. This unassuming film has its technical flaws but overcomes them all with a cast of beautiful nonactorsand lost creepy locations a true 1970s independent classic. DEATH BED also displays a unique subversive 3dimensional personality a deep and continuous layering of dream images and ideas that lend it a funhouse type of construct. The passage of time told in flashbacks and historic time travelogues the bed with its sinister black humor the rich yet understated symbolism used within its imagery. Most pleasing is the image of Aubrey Beardsly the suffering artist forever trapped inside the frame of his own painting as he comments on and fondles with the murdered victim offerings gifted to him as love offerings by the demented bed's spirit.  A sick refrain and wonderful element metaphor for the trapped artist  Nothing but the weirdest in POE or MALLARME can equal that. Anyone who values the spirit of independent cinema and craves the multilayered symbolist experience or craves the Surrealist concept of convulsivebeauty and the Gothichorror leanings of low budget exploitation filmmaking will dig this totally unique vision. A simple and fun film with deliciously deep psychic undercurrents. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. ".

A dark desolate vibe confusion an eerie subtle score and that dream quality that this masterpiece almost flaunts. Such a quality or vibe usually seems unintentional. Not only is it intentional but from what I've read Death Bed is based on an actual dream George Barry the director successfully transferred dream to film only a genius could accomplish such a task.Old mansions make for good quality horror as do portraits. Not sure what to make of the killer bed with its killer yellow liquid. A bizarre dream indeed. Also this isn't quite the brand of Bhorror I was expecting considering the cheesy title and all. Before viewing this Gothic gem I expected something more like Class Reunion Massacre. Now thats a bad movie if you've seen it you know what I'm saying.

Obviously the premise is that there is a bed that eats people well...eats is a subjective term I guess it really secretes acid bubbles to suck the victims into itself and dissolves them in it's acidy goodness. The best part of this movie is that William Russ is one of the main characters. The typical family man actually started his career with this movie...and an afro. There is plenty of nudity in this flick so obviously not for the children but that should not deter anyone from seeing this movie. It is my belief that everyone needs a little Death Bed in their lives at some point or other it's best to get it sooner than later.".

It's structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay outside of the frame. It's not like something like Halloween with all its snappy editing and POV shots Death bed actually comes across as kind of dreamy. The most pretentious way I can phrase it is this is Samuel Beckett making a haunted house movie. I mean it's a manic depressive bed that eats people! And fried chicken! Out in the middle of nowhere! And there's bone hands! I can barely articulate my feelings about this film. And yeah copping to liking this will open you up to ridicule. But things get real samey after awhile. Its hard to be a cinephile and consistently stay engaged. I can honestly say this is a fully unique film up and down. From what it is to how its put together. We need films like that movies that shake us out of our complacency. Consider it like existential camp. it's fun and it's stupid but also brilliant in its weird little way.

Considering the noticeably low budget the special effects are surprisingly decent and the film comes with the odd artistic touch or two such as a great shot of one victim's dripping blood extinguishing a candle beside the bed. The film also features a lot of uncanny elements throughout not all of which necessarily gel well. More bizarre than anything the evil bed does or anything its victims do to futilely stop themselves being eaten is the poetic voiceover narration throughout delivered by one of the bed's victims trapped behind a painting in the room. His eloquent narration is not necessarily a detractor but it is certainly very very weird in a possessed inanimate object movie like this. The film's most significant drawback is the acting with the precredits couple in particular offering amateurish turns. If one can get over the second rate acting strange voiceover narration and such oddities as the bed being spliced into old newsreel footage ! this is an undeniably unique horror film and one that  at the very least  manages to makes its possessed object seem sinister without the need to talk or move.".

	schema:reviewBody ". . . but well above average for an amateur film.First I must say that for having been produced on such a small budget this sure is quite a capable film  surprisingly so.The story behind this obscure horror film is quite unique this movie is centered around a cursed antique fourposter bed and the imprisoned soul of an artist whose held captive behind one of his paintings he also happens to serve as the movies narrator. It's a very short film clocking in at a mere 67 minutes but throughout it's short duration it tells a compelling story which owes a lot to the voice of Patrick SpenceThomas whose clipped and elegant narrations in what sounds a MidAtlantic accent capably guides us through this film that has a most unusual premise a bed that eats people with much eloquence and class. That accent is all but extinct today but here it lends itself perfectly to the film which is further dressed up with the inclusion of a heavy amount of dark imagery and the macabre which are often lightly tinged with overtones that come off as vaguely satanic and yet are very effective. On the matter of blood and guts a light spattering of gore effects is used which provides the film with the necessary visceral edge which works well with the films heavy use of sordid visual material.It's creators achieved a surprisingly highlevel sophistication in filmmaking with what looks like a very limited budget which of course is one defining hallmarks of amateur filmmaking. With that being said it completely leaves the question open and makes one wonder what the very same crew could have done with a bigger budget but as it stands it's still pretty effective as it is. The story that Death Bed tells is a fairly complex one whose plot is woven together by many layers of richly lurid detail which not only describe the creation of the death bed but also it's long and colorful deadly past. Most of the films complexity revolves around the fact that there are so many charactersvictims which represent so many different era's but once again the narrator does such an excellent job colorfully and concisely describing the films many unwholesome events and as a result you never feel lost at any point and though it is a bit slow at times the coherency of the movie never falters. However with that being said if you don't listen to the narrator nothing about the movie will make sense.Poe Influence For fans of classic literary horror I find that this film is very effective in projecting a world that looks as if it came straight from the mind of Edgar Allen Poe and I don't even like Poe but it's hard to refute the vibe and air that this film projects even if it is set in modern times 1977. For several reasons from the narration to the gated and dilapidated stone mansion to the antique fourposter bed by the looks of it Poe himself may have slept on just such a bed in his better times to the withered tombstones and other macabre visuals. This film seeps and drips heavily with the sort of imagery influence and atmosphere that's undeniable Poeesque and which I kinda doubt it was by accident or can be chalked up to coincidence. The movie concludes in invigorating fashion and through an impromptu form of exorcism the history of the accursed bed of death comes full circle  in fiery destruction  yet from destruction a past life is reborn. The conclusion of the film works very well and does an admirable job of tying together all of the movies most important plotpoints and visual ques. Death Bed is an artsy offtheradarscreen type of feature that includes gore and flashes of nudity both of which help seal it's fate relegating this film to a bleak and unmarketable existence one beset in perpetual obscurity. The odds of catching this movie on TV at any hour are extremely remote and it's also likely to have a very limited availability in the home video market.Unfortunately... once it's all said and done Death Bed is not exactly what I would call Essential Viewing. It's a 40 year old amateur film and it looks like one. However it does have a certain charming repugnance to it that I think many viewers will readily appreciate and maybe even admire.".

Its a great blend of scifihorror that borrows heavily from others but still emerges as a cool flick nonetheless.The simplified plot leaves some good guys and gal trying to stay alive in a sealed corporate skyscraper while being hunted by a robot controlled by the fantastically OTT Brad Dourif. There are a few subplots to keep things interesting between the characters.The heroine of the piece is the very cute Ely Pouget who gives a terrific performance. She is joined by a couple of wouldbe terrorists  Martin McDougall and John Sharian who some may recognize from his role in The Machinist.The plot is good if a little farfetched hey I did say this was scifihorror and director Stephen Norrington skillfully constructs an effective sense of fear with tongueincheek humor which belies this being his first time at the helm he would later go on to direct Blade and the lessthanstellar The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.The effects are very good for what must have been a small budget and the robot which is reminiscent of a alienterminator hybrid is well designed.There are strong influences from movies such as Universal Soldier Alien and Hardware...and most of the death scenes are quite vicious though its not really that gory. Also many of the characters are named after horror directors  John Carpenter Sam Raimi Scott Ridley etc  not so much as a wink to them but rather a 10 foot neon sign  but it kinda adds to the charm.Final word goes out to Mr Dourif who steals every scene he is in. He's funny creepy pathetic and totally manic. I have a feeling Norrington just let Dourif go wild in the role.TTKK's Bottomline  If you like scifihorror mixed with a bit of cheese and some laughs you can't go wrong with Death Machine".

He'd like to attract a girlfriend so he's fashion conscious with a rock and roll goth hippie Rastafari vibe to his look. He's really attracted to Hayden. He's an enthusiastic owner an adult publication she appeared in in her younger days. He's quirky but he does his best to win her heart with a great sense of humor trys to earn her trust. Then Scott trys to arrange to get Hayden killed so Jack takes the creep out with his death machine. Hayden doesn't know that Scott got what he deserved and that Jack saved her life she thinks he's crazy. Before Jack can explain fully the Eco Terrorists who may just be after 350 billion in master soft wear bonds!  AROO AROO AROOHA! bust in and point machine guns...Jack understandably sicks the death machine on them preserving Hayden just by surveillance and lifting his finger off the deadman's switch on his remote. The director TRICKS us! He trys to make us despise Jack by tricks in the story and casting bizzaro Brad Dourif as Jack. Mr. Dourif was born in 1950 but they try to make him look like 25using a wig in 1995. This makes him creepier than he already is. Plus he's a hacker. I think there are more than a few of us online who hate the word. This film was almost preinternet so new viewers will hate Jack more than 1995 viewers. The first death machine murder is foisted on Jack but there's no proof of his involvement and no real exploration of the circumstances of the crime. The Hardmen project doesn't kill it's participants or erase their minds permanently in fact they may be paid blackopps recruits in my opinion. In the last scene we think Jack is killed by his own death machine but he couldn't have been.. since he knows it only attacks those who fear it! So what we have is an absolutely brilliant script that fools the heck out of us plus it is a very poingent love story as well intentioned Jack ends up like Romeo ended up.but not really! A lot of the camera work in the film is original and outstanding. I think this film owes more to Bladerunnner than any other film in look and soundtrack. If they cut or re shot the cop cut a line or two here and there or voiced over them we'd have a popular masterpiece.  Rachael Weisz has 10 seconds in this film. A close up of her face with 4 lines in her British accent and black hair. Very pretty. I love you Rachael...you love me too right???".

	schema:reviewBody "On watching Death Machine I had no real idea what to expect other than a SciFi movie. I'd heard it mentioned in the same breath as Hardware a film I love dearly and had seen Norrington's League of Extraordinary Gentleman and Blade so checked it out. Death Machine is an efficient exciting slice of scifi action with more or less everything one looks for in the genre.The first thing that hits with this movie is the look. Every frame oozes pure class and the production design is flawless. From Jack Dante's hellish office through to the Death Machine itself everything has been designed to a tee with all elements gelling together like clockwork. Production design is often an area cult movies skimp on and to see such painstaking work will fill anyone especially cult movie buffs with a sense of glee.Second thing is the wonderful cast. Just as the design was obviously a labour of love so was the casting. Everyone is just right for their part and acts with great gusto never jolting the viewer out of the film world. Main players Ely Pouget and Brad Dourif a personal favourite turn in performances of a calibre rarely seen in the cinema let alone a straight to video title both more watchable than any Hollywood star or starlet I can think of. The supporting cast are fantastic too.There are a few unfortunate aspects to the Death Machine though. Firstly the movie is long for an action movie longer in Britain than America strangely and therefore may not appeal to the 'quick rental and a takeaway' crew that these movies normally filter down to. Secondly the movie has unfortunately dated a little purely due to the fact that the blockbuster action genre took a turn for the worst somewhere around the release of The Fast and the Furious and they therefore don't make 'em like this anymore. I had no problem with this having been brought up with the movies of the 80s and 90s but newer film enthusiasts may find this a tricky movie to get their heads round as a result.Still as always with good STV titles your perseverance and curiosity will be firmly rewarded if you take a chance on this. It's a brilliant movie and shouldn't be overlooked as one of the better scifi movies to come out of the 90s. Add to that the fact that it's recently been reissued at a budget price in my native UK and you have the makings of a bonafide rediscovered underground classic.".

Hayden Cale Ely Pouget the woman in charge of covering up for the companies tracks is being left in the dark about the real things happening in Chaank Armaments namely the afore mentioned experiments. Not only that she's being targeted by the prodigy child of the company who invents all of the flashy equipment they produce only not really targeted for death more targeted for 'mating' since she has a dark past of her own. Jack Dante Brad Dourif the prodigal child then proceeds to take whatever steps necessary to get his 'prize'. And all of this happens on the night some ecoterrorists well some low cookoff of them anyhow decide to expose Chaank for what it really is. Add a mechanical monster some comical scenes and voila you have Death Machine a brilliant little.. well. SciFi Splatter movie. I have to admit I only rented the movie because it starred Brad Dourif which I think is a brilliant actor. He played in various movies Alien  Resurrection The Prophecy III series Star Trek  Voyager and even a game Myst III  Exile all in which he put down a fantastic performance even when the movie or series wasn't upto much good. Voyager Alien 4 and The Prophecy 3 for example If I had ten thumbs I'd put them all up!".

The film itself is not overly gory but is instead remarkably discomforting and surprisingly funny and thoughtful. It takes quite a while for any real action to start the beginning instead being used for interesting plot and character development sequences.Brad Dourif does one of the most wonderful acting performances of his life here as the childlike psychotic genius Jack Dante who develops the ultimate killing machine. Wearing a long black leather coat and having long black hair he looks perfect for the part and gives a genuinely creepy performance  yet still makes you feel sorry for him. He's also been given most of the best lines in the pretty fantastic script with many laughoutloud moments for the viewer It's cool here! There's tons of... stuff!.A note about the violence and gore the film has an 18 certificate in the UK and you would expect some pretty gruesome stuff for a film in that category yet there is surprisingly very little. When the Death Machine of the title gets to kill someone in most cases the death isn't seen at all and left up to the viewer's imagination. There ARE some fairly bloody moments but I don't think this film really deserves the 18 certificate I've seen worse in 15rated movies.The film remains constantly engaging has strong actors all round and is directed very well. A great script with quite a lot of comedy moments sets this film apart from other lowbudget scifi horror movies. Great fun.".

Although borrowing from the style used in ALIEN that of dark corridors and chase sequences.  it moves on from this with the introduction of a comical element provided by three of the worlds most badly prepared ecotype warriors who pick the wrong time to expose the corporation for what it is.  Needless to say all are ruthlessly hunted to extinction by a first class frontline moral destroyer.The storyline the tense combination of will they survive? and the fluid motion of the robot especially is what makes the film appealing with a very strong performance from Brad Dourif thrown in for good measure.This is definately a guys movie even though the heroine comes nowhere near to romping around a commercial cargo vessel in panties and a tight Tshirt!".

So stay with it and you'll probably enjoy it.The production was reasonable. The effects were fair to very good. The direction and editting were very good. The writing was weak at first but improved in the middle to the end. The acting especially toward the end was believable. The sound track was well done.So overall I think this movie is lacking something  it's look is cheap. E.g. it's name DeathMachine is a poor attempt at being scary. Maybe War Beast would have been better? And so I think it's the cheapness of the cinematography  it didn't look professionally made  that weakened this otherwise good movie.Kudos to the writerdirector Stephen Norrington Zafoid".

It's about a company that is illegally on working weapons made out of humans by resetting their brain while their mastermind is working on something very different in the background. First of all. The acting is great on all parts. No matter if it's Ely Pouget who gives her Hayden some real depth and still shows us what a real badass of the 80ies and 90ies looked like. With Carpenter and Ridley we have 2 characters that we are supposed to hate and we kinda do. We just also love them for their craziness. But the real star of course is always Brad Dourif. He just needs to enter the room and within seconds he already got everyone into his role. He is pure over the top crazy but it is just awesome as you can see how much fun he had. The most important thing besides that are the effects. No matter if we are talking about the gore which is rare but effective or stuff like the monster. The effects are great and still look great today. With the score the camera and the fast cuts this creates are very nice atmosphere that lets you fear for characters and celebrate Dante whenever you see him.All in all this is a really great movie that you should already just watch if you are a fan of Dourif in any way or if you are into horror at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to be honest I really wasn't expecting much when I hit the play button for 1994's Death Machine. At the very least I thought it might be good for a few unintentional laughs like many directtovideo films are. But what I got instead was actually a pretty entertaining and thrilling scifi gem. The story takes place sometime in the distance future where a corrupt weapons corporation has come under fire for the deaths of several people when one of its killer robots malfunctions and goes rouge. As a result a new CEO by the name of Hayden Cale the beautiful Ely Pouget from 1991's revival of Dark Shadows is brought in to clean things up. But she soon gets more than she bargained for when she crosses swords with the person who really calls the shots eccentric and psychotic weapons designer Jack Dante played by the voice of Chucky himself Brad Dourif. Once he realizes his power is being threatened Jack does what any twisted weapon designer would do Build and unleash the ultimate killing machine on the corporate executives! Things only get more interesting when a group of peace activists break into to destroy the headquarters only to get sucked into the nightmare instead. From there it's a battle of survival as our friends navigate through a treacherous high rise building with the death machine hot on their trail.It all might sound a bit cheesy and truth be told it is. However it is the good type of cheesiness the kind that is charming and can only happen when the right combination happens. A big part of that combination is the actors involved. Clearly this is not the most Oscar worthy plot ever written but that doesn't stop everyone involved from giving everything they got to their roles especially Brad Dourif. With his constant on screen charisma he is able to breath life into a character that is both insane and yet fascinating as he plots murder and plays with his toys. Ely Pouget plays the strong female character with great relish as she struggles to overcome the situation she's in. One should also congratulate the actors who play the peace activists John Sharian and Martin McDougall since we come to actually care about them. And of course what good would a movie about an ultimate killing machine be if it didn't include a good kickass machine to go with it and man do we get it here. I don't won't to reveal too much about it since that would spoil the surprise. All I'll say is that in a genre that has seen more than its share of killing machines the filmmakers here manage to create something unique cool and from your worst nightmare to boot! Plus the movie has good crisp direction from director Stephen Norrington. Plus there is that intangible movie magic at work here that only makes things all the more better. So if any of this sounds to your liking give Death Machine a try if your someone who likes cheesy but good flicks you won't regret it.".

Lethal Weapon 4 for example had more humor in it than Death Machine. This is a great movie with a strong resemblance to Aliens not Alien despite public opinion. The costume design on the Hardman suit was very good for a low budget film. The camera work was really good especially in certain scenes where several emotions are caught in them. The movie features a good plot and believable tech for the year it takes place in. It does feature some cheesy lines in a couple of parts but other than that its dialogue is strong. Our tree hugging heros are very likable too. In my own humble opinion which of course is the only one that matters if this were rereleased as a theatrical motion picture it'd be the action flick of the summer next year! This one gets a 9!".

This was and it was a nice surprise for a dollar and it was what Hardware should have been.Without giving away too much of the story it is about a war weapons development corporation that has a renegade inventor who builds a killer robot called the Warbeast. The renegade inventor Brad Dourif recreating his Wise Blood character in part is also insane and eventually the Warbeast is let loose. There's also a neat sequence where the Warbeast battles a human cyborg reminiscent of Alien 2 seems to be intentional. The Warbeast resembles a mechanical Alien and Scott Ridley is a character. Many other characters named from film personalities as well.A little sluggish at first but really makes up for that later in the film. Also probably not enough of the Warbeast slaughtering folks visible for some gorehounds but what there is is well done. Seems like they were about two characters short to really create a good rampage by the Warbeast but budget constraints notwithstanding they did a very good job overall.".

Brad Dourif is my favorite actor I saw him in alien 4 and lord of the rings not knowing who he was then a friend told me to watch child's play. I saw him again so I couldn't stop myself from finding out who he was I saw at least 5 music videos on you tube about this movie which made me order it. Now I have more than 50 of his films and will keep collecting until all of them sit in my basement with my movies. Highly recommended if you like the cheesy scifi or horror movies like Hardware although I did not like hardware because dogs died in it. It is being sold very cheap on amazon and is worth 789675 to me. Although I bought it for less than ten dollars.".

Now there are some character issues I mean these peace mongers don't understand without weapons certain Governments of this world would walk all over you and steal you basic human rights. Also some of the dialog in the movie is a tad on the corny side. But I love WARBEAST.

Unfortunately though Death Machine goes too far in a few categories resulting in an eyerollinggroan instead of the genuine amused chuckle.  It doesn't quite nail the blending of two genres appropriately nor is it entirely effective but it does an okay job.  The movie does wear out its welcome by the time the final act starts.The Death Machine aka the WarBeast didn't set well with me.  Kind of a mechanical terminatorish Alien with autisminspired hypertwitches with its claws reminding me of the guy from Cube for some reason.  It's not that the thing looked unrealistic it's the fact that it moved like a chihuahua on a coffee high.Also the character suited up in the super soldier gear went a bit too far over the top with his Unisolfromhell impression.  Every now and then I found myself chuckling at him or his comments but for the most part I think he should've pulled back just a tad.There's a few others but I'll just comment on one more that bugged me.  The alltooblunt reference to famous directors giving characters the same first and last name or in a 'clever twist' swapping 'em around . . . I really think references are more effective when they're subtle and not glaring at you from the screen with a big red blinking light. The tongueincheek approach and goofy nature and the fact they walked a thin line of parodyseriousness didn't bother me . . . I just felt they didn't do too hot a job of walking that line and frequently went overboard on the parody side.On the plus side everyone feels right in their appointed roles and the production valueeffects are for the most part appropriate.  Ely Pouget and Brad Dourif are the stars here they play off each other nicely.  The Dante character would've come across as incredibly lame in the hands of a lesser actor but Dourif gives Dante a very unique aura of childish menace and pulls off one one the performances and creating probably the best character in the film.Pouget is fun as Cale constantly bouncing her chivarlous and noble comments off the demented Dante. The humor in Pouget and Dourif's performance comes about from their seriousstraight forward delivery.  Despite the wackiness surrounding them these two characters are probably the most grounded in reality . . . which is weird sad and entertaining at the same time and well you have to see the film to understand.If material has to be 100 believable for you to like a movie . . . why do you still watch movies?  Death Machine is a movie where you suspend your belief just to sit back and embrace the corniness as it pokes fun at its big cinematic brethren . . . I just wish it did a little better job of it throughout the whole movie.  Oh well it was worth the rental price.".

Another factor that sets this film apart from previous vigilante thrillers is that it still manages to serve up quite a few twists and turns that add to the tension.As exciting and gripping as this film is please be forewarned the violence shown on screen is not for those with weak stomachs. It's graphic brutal edgy and tense. Still this does not detract from the film at all. If anything it makes the whole experience more visceral.".

The movie never slows down or gets boring. John Goodman also appears in a nice cameo role. Fans of Death Wish The Brave One Harry Brown The Punisher Law abiding citizen shud definitely check this out. I was most impressed by the camera work in the chase scenes. I was rooting for the lead character from the word go and Bacon did not let me down. Death sentence was a great thrill ride from the emotional opening credits to the chilling conclusion. At times it was brutal gory n depressing. The music by Charlie Clouser Saw series The collection Resident evil extinction was very effective at establishing the proper mood. It has some hard hitting action fantastic foot chase some amazing gun fights n some unique death scenes. The soundtrack is very depressing and moody and helps set the tone of the film. Its directed by James Wan Saw Dead silence Insidous Conjuring Fast n furious 7. Nice cinematography by John R. Leonetti Conjuring Insidious. It's based on the book sequel to the original Deathwish written by Brian Garfield the author of Death wish.".

Some of the dialogue was cheesy but that is what makes it great.The only problem I had with the film was the detective role. She seemed to serve zero purpose whatsoever. I am not taking away from the acting done for that role. But every scene she was in was slower and just did not fit with the rest of the movie. Other then acting as a very short winded inner monologue for Bacon's character all she did was say no no your safe they're dead and no. We all knew where this movie was going we didn't need the attempt to turn into a crime drama. If you did not like this movie you went into it expecting the wrong thing. This is a revenge movie. It had no supernatural parts. When someone was shot they bled a lot and they were in pain. If you ever wanted to exact revenge on someone in your own mind or in your dreams go see this movie it is great.".

And if a policewoman would know you did it she'll just tell you it's not OK.Your friends at work would never ask you why your hand is all wrapped in bandage and is bleeding. But if you want to be sure  put your hand behind your back.Working in an office would put you in better shape than any gang member.There is no bullet in the world that can hit Kevin Bacon  unless he's running in slow motion or found in red lighting environment which tends to make him vulnerable.Kelly Preston never learned what overacting means.If you secured the entire house and locked all the windows it's OK to open the door to whoever rings the bell.If you're working in a hospital it's good to tell a joke to someone whose entire family has just been murdered.If you're working in a bank it's good to tell a joke to someone who draws all his savings.If you're working in a bar you would never believe that anyone else speaks Spanish.Always read the instructions before using a weapon. It will also teach you how to shoot.Having your son in hospital would give you immunity when murdering bad guys.It's important to shave your head before going to kill your family's murderers.If you're going to crash into another guy's car don't put your seat belt  it's for puies.Mutilation is supercool.Even Kevin Bacon can't save this movie from James Wan's direction.110 Hilarious movie.

It will also teach you how to shoot.Having your son in hospital would give you immunity when murdering bad guys.It's important to shave your head before going to kill your family's murderers.If you're going to crash into another guy's car don't put your seat belt  it's for puies.Mutilation is supercool.Even Kevin Bacon can't save this movie from James Wan's direction.110 Hilarious movie. Highly recommended!";

	schema:reviewBody "Good golly this is one bad bad movie. I must agree with one poster on the message boards Sitting all the way through such a dumb movie leaves one feeling pretty stupid.What's wrong with this movie? Well when creating fiction a good rule of thumb is to come up with some sympathetic characters  at least the main character should be someone with whom the audience can empathize. The plot should also be plausible. Unfortunately the main character in Death Sentence is a complete idiot and the plot is so ridiculous I cannot even come up with an adequate metaphor. If you are tempted to watch this movie please allow me to save you some time with this short summary. First the main character Nick Hume played by Kevin Bacon almost runs out of gas with his oldest son in the car and has to stop in a very bad part of town an irresponsible oversight that directly leads to the death of his son. Then rather than send his son's murderer to prison where he could at least take some comfort in the fact that the murderer would spend the next five years or so being forcibly sodomized he decides he's Charles Bronson and murders the guy instead.Thus Mr. Hume invites the wrath of the killer's brother and his drugcrazed gang of psychopaths directly leading to the murder of his wife and the critical injuring of his other son and himself  because apparently the best thing to do when you know a gang is coming to kill you is to just stay home and wait it out. Luckily he and his son are only injured because as lustful as this gang is for revenge they only put one bullet in each family member and don't bother to check if they are dead or not. When he wakes up in the hospital he does not cry for his dead wife or kick himself for being such reckless idiot. He spends a minute with his presumably dying son then goes out the hospital window to finish what he started. Remarkably the police do not think to look for him at his home which is the first place he goes and is also a crime scene. Neither do they try to call him on his mobile phone which he is carrying or look for his car which he is driving.Mr. Hume buys a bunch of guns gives himself a very bad haircut for no apparent reason and then sets about wasting the rest of the gang in a very graphic fashion shooting like Jet Li  pretty good for a stockbroker.Critically perhaps mortally wounded Mr. Hume goes home  where the police finally figure out he might be  sits down on his sofa and watches old home movies. The police tell him his son might pull through. The movie ends there but we can assume in a final act of idiocy that Mr. Hume dies thereby leaving his sole surviving son an orphan. Thanks Dad.In closing I suggest that if you need to see a revenge movie rent Death Wish instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was terrible. I was fooled into watching because I think Kevin Bacon is excellent and the high scores on this site. So I felt compelled to help lower the average score and warn as many people away as I can.I like revenge movies. I liked concept of a man who's family is killed who turns into a supervigilante. I am willing to suspend a great deal of disbelief to enjoy this kind of escapist fantasy.This movie however was nearly unwatchable for me. Suspending disbelief is one thing but this movie pushed way too far.First of all as others have mentioned the policeda are laughable. They are so completely ineffectual and unwilling even to try to stop the criminals that it defied all of my efforts to swallow the plot. I mean if this were say ... Gotham city I might have been OK with it because the city depicted in that movie is not meant to be realistic. Rampant crime and corruption are expected which is why they need to use the bat signal every so often to call in a superhero.Death Sentence is placed more as a drama than superhero fantasy and that's why the same sort of attitude that the police department is powerless to stop the violent gang members is well ridiculous. Especially considering that there's only like 10 criminals involved in the entire operation. And as far as I can tell it doesn't go any higher than some greasy small arms dealer who works out of a garage. The cops can't deal with small time crooks and thugs?Here there is a gas station robbery and a ganginitiation homicide with the suspect who is id'ed by a witness and is then hit by a car outside the gas station immediately afterward. The DA can't win this case? It's a Tee ball case he should be hitting it out of the park. The defense will ask you questions like when was your last eye exam or what do you have against inner city youth. Really? These are concerning questions that might sway a jury? Again laughable.And the idea that 2 police officers are murdered and the PD hasn't organized their own hunting party for the criminals is just plain stupid. 2 police officers murdered and the best that the police can do is to 1. station a guard outside bacon's room to stop HIM from doing anything? and 2. blame him for the death of his family. Huh.The problem as I see it is this. The police in this movie weren't meant to be you know policemen. They were written as a foil to the protagonist an additional hurdle that he had to overcome. It felt like this was based on a bad comic book.It felt like the screenplay was written by a 13 year old with no exposure even on TV? to the actual real world. Sure in this world there is corruption there is incompetence. But it's not this open not this blatant and not this systematic ... at least in a major US city when the murder victim is the son of a senior VP of an insurance company. And especially not if the criminals are just a bunch of drug using gas station robbing thugs.Maybe if it was set in the wild west or some place that is normally perceived as lawless like a central American country as in Man on Fire or Gotham City it would be more acceptable. But this movie was trash ... immature and unrealistic to the point of being difficult to watch.".

First off I love me some revenge films.From the masterful Park ChanWook's vengeance trilogy Straw Dogs or Dead Man's Shoes to the brutal I Spit on Your Grave or Thriller En Grym Film there is no genre that does it for me quite like revenge. So when I first heard about Death Sentence I figured it'd be worth a viewing Kevin Bacon murdered child director of Saw I expected it to be at least passable.Well I humbly stand corrected. I'm pretty sure if you are someone defendingchampioning this movie you are either a semiretarded or b you need to see a real revenge movie. Everything about this POS is so blatantly onedimensional that I'm amazed it doesn't slide off the celluloid it was filmed on...The victim's family doesn't seem THAT upset that their son was murdered there's no real passion about anything  it's all just very gowiththeflow. The courtroom scene is pure comedy gold with the 97poundweakling 'killer' smirking and leering at a prettymuchnonplussed Kevin Bacon. Bacon's character Nick Hume doesn't appear too tortured about losing his 'golden boy' okay he sobs in the shower once  and the murder of his son's killer seems almost spurofthemoment.As for the thugs they're all hilarious  a bunch of didn'tquitemakethecut extras from a circa1997 nmetal video shoot and should be filed under 'outdated badass' at Central Casting Come on tribal tattoos and facial piercings!? What are they a MySpace 'gang' who still listen to bands like Staind or Disturbd or some other group of notalents who can't spell either? And look there's Johnny Goodman! Just a day or two before seeing this I was thinking to myself 'Why haven't I seen John Goodman in anything good lately?' I guess now I know why he's way too busy making turkeys like this. The oneliners aren't clever not even in a juvenile way and one line of dialogue Fear is for the enemy. Fear and bullets. is ripped almost wordforword from James O'Barr's The Crow another epic revenge story turned into a lousy movie.As for the acting? Kevin Bacon is the only one who almost pulls it off but only almost.Kelly Preston? Obviously not she can't even act like Travolta isn't gay.Goodman? Nope. Sorry.Garrett 'Youjustboughtyourfamilyadeathsentence!' Hedlund? Hey if I wanted to see a goth kid have a temper tantrum I'd just email Weston Cage that Little Debbie's had gone out of business  or that there was now a worldwide shortage of blueblack hair dye.I digress  you know how certain foreign markets tend to eat up some movies better than the film's own home country does? Well apparently my fellow Canadians love this movie because it has so many references to their national excuse hockey. The murdered son the one Nick Hume actually likes is a hockey player and wants to go to Canada and we see a cop picking up a broken hockey stick at a crime scene after Hume has killed one of the 'gang' members. I counted at least 3 or 4 references to hockey in this movie and I heard the movie was intended to be released here under the name Sudden Death Sentence Eh? Back to the topic at hand  this movie sucked. The bad guys get off way too easily same as in every other revenge movie. Nobody's cracked it yet  the revenge film that goes all the way. We don't even get to see Nick Hume waste Billy Darley in this movie. All that time wasted and there's not even a bloody payoff for the audience. What a waste of 110 minutes. James Wan whose first Saw film was at least memorable has dropped the ball horribly. He should instead stick to casting winners like Donnie Wahlberg in his movies and coming up with cheesy grossouts like the needle pit in Saw II. Truly the only death sentence in this cinematic abortion is the viewer's own  knowing that they are now 110 wasted minutes closer to their own demise.Enjoy!".

Back to the topic at hand  this movie sucked. The bad guys get off way too easily same as in every other revenge movie. Nobody's cracked it yet  the revenge film that goes all the way. We don't even get to see Nick Hume waste Billy Darley in this movie. All that time wasted and there's not even a bloody payoff for the audience. What a waste of 110 minutes. James Wan whose first Saw film was at least memorable has dropped the ball horribly. He should instead stick to casting winners like Donnie Wahlberg in his movies and coming up with cheesy grossouts like the needle pit in Saw II. Truly the only death sentence in this cinematic abortion is the viewer's own  knowing that they are now 110 wasted minutes closer to their own demise.Enjoy!";

Bacon has always been an actor whose dives headfirst into difficult roles and this one covers a wide range of emotions...from family concern and love to grief to rage to fear to finally cold machinelike calm. I was particularly impressed with James Wan who really raised his game to Alist level easily creating moments of drama action and suspense.

If you are looking for a best picture candidate you will not find it here. However it is a very entertaining engrossing movie that will probably not appeal to the squeamish. The movie fits right into the Parent Revenge mold quite well. The oldest son is killed by gang. Dad avenges death. Gang fights back. Dad goes crazy and kills gang members before the whole thing culminates in a final shootout full of graphic carnage. If you are looking for an insane action movie this isn't quite it. In particular the first half is very deliberate in trying to convey Bacon as a real guy trying to avoid violence but ultimately succumbing to it. I found this journey that he takes to be quite believe up until a scene near the end in a hospital in which he turns into Rambo. Rather than being moving it is slightly laughable. Then the movie turns into a straightforward albeit very well shot action flick full of gore and carnage. Many critics bashed the film for it's hypocrisy in having the movie condemn violence while later depicting it in stylish perversely entertaining detail. However I think this was justified by a gang leaders quote at near the end of the film. Look at you he says to Bacon. You've turned into one of us. The man is right. The gang leaders have slit throats and shot heads. But so has Bacon. He is a lesser of two evils to be sure but an evil none the less. While this may be a cheap attempt by the director the make the film more serious it does work. It is true that Bacon has transformed into a kind of monster. I give great credit to Bacon's performance along with almost ever other actor. If a dark violent disturbing movie is what you are in the mood for this weekend skip Halloween and go see this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now for starters I'm going to tell you what happens. Loving family lalalalala Bacon is a great father he brings his boy home from a hockey game makes a pit stop bunch of psychos kill him at the gas station as an initiation for a new gang member. The rest run away while Bacon grabs the killer then the guy gets loose yells in the middle of the street at his buddies for abandoning him and gets hit by a car from behind. The rest is very self explanatory Bacon kills him and a war is started between Bacon and the rest of the psychos. Now there is so much wrong with this movie it's insulting to mankind. Star Wars and The Matrix are more realistic than this movie is. First off Bacon has a cell phone so instead of calling the cops ambulance etc he decides to hold his son whose jugular just so happens to be pouring out blood and scream at the top of his lungs HELP several times. It's this scene that begins the very annoying and repetitive little sob story tune that starts playing literally every 1015 minutes of the movie. I know this because I actually timed it. Thats how often it is. During the time that the song plays there is a lot of slow mo and dumb little scenes that are supposed to make you cry but just don't. The problem is you can't tell if this is an action movie or drama. I started watching hoping to watch a cool simple gory action movie. Instead I got an hour and 45 minutes of contaminating cheese. To say that this movie is clich would be an insultingly gross understatement. This movie is so full of stereotypes and cheesy lines that I truly wanted to vomit at many points. I honestly think that soap operas are more dramatic and realistic. The acting to put it simply is unfair. I don't think that people deserve such treatment. If you paid to watch this movie I weep for you. Each character is so unbalanced it is shocking that the movie actually stayed together. There's a terrible mix of overacting and underacting. Most of the overacting is done by Preston who obviously enjoys acting like a deranged schizophrenic in one scene and a calm cheesy housewife in another.Next is how unrealistic the physical and real life aspects of the movie are since the emotional ones are made of cheese. In the beginning of the movie the killer is hit by a car from the back flies over and falls on his back. However for some reason he seemingly escapes with only a few cuts and bruises and ironically has no damage to his legs or butt even though thats where he was hit. Next if you called the cops and the perp was with you they wouldn't have you point him out in a lineup. In the car fight where they actually fight inside the car Bacon at one point hits the guy in the face with a metal rod of some sort then sticks his head between the door and slams it a few times. Some how the bad guy apparently has bones of steel like wolverine from xmen lol and has no pain in his neck and easily jumps up and continues fighting. In the same scene the car they are in is not theirs' yet Bacon was able to get it in reverse mode without ever having put in any keys or even sparking some wires. For those of you who don't know how to use cars the handle that changes the driving mode only works if your foot is on the brake and the car is on but anything is possible if you're Kevin Bacon. In the end Bacon speeds up and crashes into the bad guy's van and somehow is able to break it in half all the while not getting hurt at all nor denting or even breaking the cars' headlights. How realistic. Having John Goodman in the movie was the dumbest thing possible. He really serves no purpose. He just takes up lines and space no pun intended. The worst aspect of this movie which I hope others have noticed is that they completely steal the last scenes of the movie from Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver with Robert de Niro. Here is a list of things they stole from that movie.1 Bacon shaves his head like de Niro did 2 He buys a magnum handgun like de Niro 3 There was red light in the last firefight of both movies 4 In the last firefight Bacon shoots off the bad guy's fingers gets shot in the neck and shoots the guy behind him all of which happens in Taxi Driver. Bottom line this movie is failure. Don't waste 100 minutes of your life watching it.".

The problem is you can't tell if this is an action movie or drama. I started watching hoping to watch a cool simple gory action movie. Instead I got an hour and 45 minutes of contaminating cheese. To say that this movie is clich would be an insultingly gross understatement. This movie is so full of stereotypes and cheesy lines that I truly wanted to vomit at many points. I honestly think that soap operas are more dramatic and realistic. The acting to put it simply is unfair. I don't think that people deserve such treatment. If you paid to watch this movie I weep for you. Each character is so unbalanced it is shocking that the movie actually stayed together. There's a terrible mix of overacting and underacting. Most of the overacting is done by Preston who obviously enjoys acting like a deranged schizophrenic in one scene and a calm cheesy housewife in another.Next is how unrealistic the physical and real life aspects of the movie are since the emotional ones are made of cheese. In the beginning of the movie the killer is hit by a car from the back flies over and falls on his back. However for some reason he seemingly escapes with only a few cuts and bruises and ironically has no damage to his legs or butt even though thats where he was hit. Next if you called the cops and the perp was with you they wouldn't have you point him out in a lineup. In the car fight where they actually fight inside the car Bacon at one point hits the guy in the face with a metal rod of some sort then sticks his head between the door and slams it a few times. Some how the bad guy apparently has bones of steel like wolverine from xmen lol and has no pain in his neck and easily jumps up and continues fighting. In the same scene the car they are in is not theirs' yet Bacon was able to get it in reverse mode without ever having put in any keys or even sparking some wires. For those of you who don't know how to use cars the handle that changes the driving mode only works if your foot is on the brake and the car is on but anything is possible if you're Kevin Bacon. In the end Bacon speeds up and crashes into the bad guy's van and somehow is able to break it in half all the while not getting hurt at all nor denting or even breaking the cars' headlights. How realistic. Having John Goodman in the movie was the dumbest thing possible. He really serves no purpose. He just takes up lines and space no pun intended. The worst aspect of this movie which I hope others have noticed is that they completely steal the last scenes of the movie from Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver with Robert de Niro. Here is a list of things they stole from that movie.1 Bacon shaves his head like de Niro did 2 He buys a magnum handgun like de Niro 3 There was red light in the last firefight of both movies 4 In the last firefight Bacon shoots off the bad guy's fingers gets shot in the neck and shoots the guy behind him all of which happens in Taxi Driver. Bottom line this movie is failure. Don't waste 100 minutes of your life watching it.";

I've considered pouring petrol down the hole but I can't be sure if that will destroy it I've considered firing up the tractor and excavating it like a madman on a mission.

It was built as a hospital to fight TB back in the early 1900's. There wasn't a cure and morale was low so the death tunnel was built to export bodies out of the building without the living seeing them. Patients not seeing the high death rate were given a new hope. It's an amazing building with an intriguing past and is truly believed to be haunted.Many of the scenes the director portrayed are actual accounts of what people have said to have witnessed. He's taken these stories and attempted to derive a horror flick. For this reason and this reason alone I would recommend the movie.Now to get to the movie.First off the acting isn't brilliant. Kristin Novak's character Ashley is ridiculously obnoxious and the others are overdramatic. The storyline isn't put together well and it doesn't do a very good of explaining what is going on so it's hard to follow. If you know the history of Waverly Hills it's not as bad.I dug the movie because of it's history not because it's good. I would definitely recommend checking out the episode of Ghost Hunters SciFi Channel where they investigate the building or check out the documentary Also directed by Booth and aired on the SciFi Channel.The Waverly Hills Sanatorium is an amazing place and it's a shame that the movie isn't any better.".

The fault lies solely with Philip Adrian Booth the writerdirector. If I see his name near anything else I will immediately throw myself into traffic.If you and your friends enjoy making like MST3K with crap movies this one has a lot to work with.".

There were no memorable moments. The death scenes were unoriginal and unimpressive. This movie was something I would expect to act as a project from a student in film school.

	schema:headline " Amazing filmmaking";
	schema:reviewBody "Philip Adrian Booth's 2005 film Death Tunnel is a wellmade horror flick about five college gals in lingerie locked in a huge abandoned sanatorium in Kentucky where 63000 people died of the white plague in the early 20th century. It's supposed to be a college initiation but things go sour when the ghosts of the plague victims show up! I was surprised to discover that the acting was quite good by all the principles at least for a Grade B horror flick. I say surprised because a few armchair critics diss the film for the supposed bad acting. Yes there may be some side characters whose acting is questionable but that's about it. A possible exception would be the girl who plays Ashley Kristin Novak and her overthetop performance during the shower sequence but this can be defended on the grounds that the script required a low camp approach to pull it off. How else could she deliver such dialog and be effective? She did it the way it had to be done.Death Tunnel is amazing because of its entertaining style. As far as filmmaking technique goes this is topoftheline all the way. One reviewer properly described it as extremely impressive visual style combined with top notch kinetic editing work. It's impossible to watch this movie and not be wowed by the filmmaking technique even if you don't like the story or the way it's told more on this below. It boggles the mind to think of the time  effort put into creating this film. Such attention to detail and professionalism is rare particularly in lowbudget independent fare.In addition to the filmmaking technique the locations cast and scoresoundtrack are superb. The film was largely shot at Waverly Hills Sanatorium near Louisville KY which is a perfect location for a horror flick. The film also features numerous ultragorgeous women including the ones trying in vain to get out of the sanatorium e.g. Novak as Ashley Melanie Lewis as Devon and Yolanda Pecoraro as Elizabeth a couple of the ghosts and even more. It's Grade A on this front. There's also a genuine aura of creepiness and a few good scares. Plus the modern metal song Disconnected by 9 Volt Revolt is excellent featured in both the story and the end credits counterbalanced by the haunting score by Christopher Saint Booth.All this gels together for a massively amusing work of celluloid.There's only one problem and that's the way the story is told which explains my mediocre rating the first time I viewed Death Tunnel not to mention the general negative reviews. The simple plot is presented in a very convoluted manner mostly in the first act. There are so many flashbacks flashforwards and flashbetweens it gets confusing and tempts the viewer to tune out during the first half hour. Moreover there's almost zero buildup of suspense due to the flashforwarding and the fact that the girls are shown whining in terror from their outset in the sanatorium. Thankfully the story settles down in the second and third acts where it focuses on the five girls trying to get out of the sanatorium.I suspect the Booth brothers took this nonlinear approach in the first act to disorient the viewer right out of the gate. If so it works. But this is oftputting to most people on their initial viewing because the movie requires you to concentrate in order for it to pull you in. I suggest rewatching the film kick back and just let it give you a good time. I did and it did. The story comes together as you are captivated by the movie magic.A more linear approach to the storytelling would probably have made Death Tunnel more compelling but after rewatching the film it dawned on me that Booth was shooting for art and originality above horror conventions which should be respected. Besides I was able to enter into the world of the movie and was mesmerized. What more could you ask for in an independent horror flick? The fact that Death Tunnel is an artistic horror film rather than a conventional slasher flick explains the mass of negative reviews but anyone who appreciates cinematic art will value this film. You just have to be in the right mode.Like many others I didn't like the film the first time I watched it although I was entertained by the spectacular visuals which includes the stunning women as well as the scoresoundtrack. I decided to give it another chance with an open mind and found myself fabulously entertained same thing with my third and fourth viewing. By the midpoint I found myself almost spellbound by the movie magic which held me to the climax. You just have to accept that this isn't a dialoguedriven plotdriven movie that focuses on slowly building suspense. Instead it's 90 minutes of horror and the entertaining elements thereof FROM THE GETGO which some people understandably can't appreciate. If you didn't like the movie on your first viewing I encourage you to give it a rewatch sometime with these things in mind. You might like it. FINAL WORD Death Tunnel successfully combines grisly locations  FX with stunningly beautiful women and a kinetic style for an amazingly entertaining film. What's more the ending is actually moving  there is a light at the end of the death tunnel.Death Tunnel has slowly become one of my favorite horror films. It runs 97 minutes.GRADE B".

The plot was difficult to follow the characters were horribly undeveloped and i believe there was about 20 minutes of nonsensical dialog in the movie. I watched it with a friend and we both think the script was probably 10 pages long.If the jumpy editing techniques black and white film clips and mysterious goo dripping from light bulbs had been applied with a bit more restraint perhaps they wouldn't have made the movie look like a horrible episode of Creepy Canada.

The plot was difficult to follow the characters were horribly undeveloped and i believe there was about 20 minutes of nonsensical dialog in the movie. I watched it with a friend and we both think the script was probably 10 pages long.If the jumpy editing techniques black and white film clips and mysterious goo dripping from light bulbs had been applied with a bit more restraint perhaps they wouldn't have made the movie look like a horrible episode of Creepy Canada.

The fightscenes were very solid and involved Steven Seagal in most of them not to mention a very impressive shootout at the cemetery near the end of the movie. Unfortunately the acting was not so stellar and Steven Seagal referred back to his ghetto voice in some parts which ruined his character in my opinion. Regardless the film was very good and tied his character together with his daughter very well and there were even some brief moments of humor thrown in as well.I definitely recommend this movie to a Steven Seagal fan or a fan of action movies in general Seagal has proved once again that he has still got it and I am looking very forward to his next flick Prince of Pistols.".

I have reviewed most of the Seagal films on this website and have viewed them all multiple times. This past Saturday my wife and daughter left for the night...so I sat down armed with a 6 pack of Coors Light and Blast o' Butter popcorn and into my PS3 I popped in Pistol Whipped with very low expectations. Was I pleasantly surprised! The film moves quickly. The director takes some great camera angles...great soundtrack for a Seagal film......and seems to have a great sense of what older Seagal fans enjoyed so much about him as an action icon in the late 80's and 90's. The dialogue is on par with such Seagal classics as The Glimmer Man and Out for Justice. Seagal seems to have found his charisma...with the exception of 2005's Into the Sun his last 8 or 9 DVD's have lacked that main charisma ingredient. The writers decided in this film to make Seagal's character vulnerable mean and lacking good judgement. Something Seagal hasn't been in character for quite some time. This film has a few technical problems...mainly the ending shootout could have used a little touch up in the editing room...Seagal seems to have sunglasses on and off in the same breath of dialogue??? A few stand in scenes very briefon long shots...but nothing like the crap we as Seagal fans have scene in recent efforts like The Foreigner Attack Force and Flight of Fury. The akido scenes are great and well shot...I can only hope that Seagal has found his step again...I will still be reluctant to get excited as Seagal seems to hold a pattern...After 2005's acceptable Into The Sun we got Submerged which I thought was horrible. After 2006's Shadow Man which I enjoyed we got Attack Force??? The formula for Seagal's success lies in his ability to work within the means of the Direct to DVD market and its meager budgets to produce films like this one which will secure his fan base to push him back into theatrical contention. Time is running out for the aging star...but I strongly suggest you watch this film.".

This one has a plot that actually keeps your interest even though the main twist is telegraphed ahead of time by going beyond the simple they killed his loved ones and now he wants revenge scenario without becoming a muddled mess like say Mercenary For Justice. It also has a pretty slick look and the action includes a wellfilmed car chase climaxing with a spectacular car flip and a John Woo  style graveyard shootout at the end. Seagal tries to play a morally ambivalent character which he does up to a point but the usual problems associated with his characters the invulnerability and the vanity are still present wait till you hear a girl's remark about a certain body part of his. He is still overweight and most of the fight scenes are blinkandyou'llmissthem but at least he is there doing them and doing them efficiently. The movie also benefits from a good supporting cast though Lance Henriksen should have had more screen time. Renee Goldsberry is gorgeous  tough and earns Pistol Whipped a few more points. 12".

	schema:headline " Steven finally putting effort for his fans";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a big Steven Seagal fan of his 90s movies but began to loose faith in him after Half Past Dead. That was a very impressive movie which did not deserve a rating of 3.9 out of 10. Plenty of action and humour plus some great kicks from seagal. After his StraighttoDVD features i began to lose faith his fights looked so fake because he had stunt doubles that looked nothing like him and his voice was dubbed pointlessly.Then came Renegade Justice or Urban Justice as US calls it it was a very decent action flick and made me see that he dozen't need to retire early. The fights were all done by seagal and dubbing was ignored. It was also a fun film to watch and a musthave for all seagal fans. What I mostly love about it is seeing seagal the way we use to know him in the 90s. Just no original plot.This film that I am talking about is the best seagal film I have ever seen. This is mainly because he isn't the hero in this film. There are no heroes in this film. He is an alcoholic excop with a gambling problem a huge debt and a neglectful father. It convinced me on what a depressing character he was.The soundtrack was brilliant. At the start seeing Seagal shooting in a cemetery while there was emotional music playing in the background made me see the drama in this film. The second scene where seagal and the priest are talking really described his character as not being some perfect hero but a more realistic character. These problems that he has is also his fault.The action was also brilliant as well. There is still mindless violence in this movie but that won't spoil your fun as the fight scenes are still realistic but they are not the reason why this movie is so great. Seagal also shows talent and emotion in his acting which is very rare as he is mostly acting with his fists and guns.This is the best seagal DVD movie yet. Mainly because it is something a little different than his others and is the most unique out of all of the films he has been in.".

Let me tell you from the getgo PISTOL WHIPPED is as equally good with despite it's lower budget better production values although i suspect Urban Justice was given a grittier raw look on purpose? Seagal plays Matt a disgraced ex cop who been sliding off the tracks since his suspension. He's been gambling and hitting the bottle and most importantly ignoring his estranged wife and daughter. It seems that despite his shortcomings Matt is still a proficient badass but he's more of a bad guy than he'd care to admit. Suddenly his gambling debts have caught up with him in the shape of a shady businessman great cameo by Lance Henrickson who offers to clear the debts if Matt will 'terminate with extreme prejudice' some wiseguy mafioso type. Being of dubious morals Matt undertakes this job fearing for the safety of his daughter and in true Seagalstyle opens up the required whupass on said contract. But it doesn't end there......Matt's new mysterious employer wants more people 'taken care' of....including his exwife's new husband a fellow cop and one of Matts friends But is his friend everything he seems?Seagal fans will enjoy this one as it give the stout sensei a chance to relax let it all hang out and play as in OUT FOR JUSTICE a scummy antihero who's far worse than the bad guys he's taking down. Yet there's a genuine warmth between Seagal and his onscreen daughter proving he can be a good natural actor when he drops his defences Seagal plays the part perfectly a crying shame he's been making duff movies in Romania when PISTOL WHIPPED is one of the lowest budgets he's worked with. Director Roel Reine has a good visual eye and if anything it proves that Seagal can work in the confines of a low budget provided as we've always known he ditches the 'wrong element' around him the 'yes' men These people have gladly cashed cheques as Seagal has been involved in some truly dire projects of recent. Good to see you back on track Steven....stick with directorspeople that give a damn.All in all PISTOL WHIPPED is a great Seagal biffemup thriller with it's lead showing as Stallone has done likewise that age is nothing but a number some of the fights here are extremely brutal and Seagal has lost none of his trademark speed or for that matter wit check out some of his dry dialogue....very funny for fans of the genre and it's comforting to see Seagal playing a flawed allbeit still untouchable character who's not a straightlaced good guy. Once again i have a SEAGAL movie that survives repeated viewing and one to show off to my mates. All in all Big Lee gives this great movie 10 out of 10".

That is classic SS and a throwback to the early days like in Marked For Death etc so from that perspective fans should not feel disappointed. Also thought the inclusion of the guy who was in quite a few films in the early 90's the character Blue was a good one. He was in some real good films like King of New York and Sea of Love and it was good to see him in this film he comes over pretty well as some kind of mobster who clearly does not respect Seagal or even his Boss. Also thought the scene where Seagal tackles his ass in the house was good to watch always like seeing SS do fight choreography with actors who are not in the business for that reason. Storyline is OK perfectly acceptable to call in a debt from a lethal family man to knock off a few wide boys. All in all this is probably one of Seagals best 10 movies.".

He was in some real good films like King of New York and Sea of Love and it was good to see him in this film he comes over pretty well as some kind of mobster who clearly does not respect Seagal or even his Boss. Also thought the scene where Seagal tackles his ass in the house was good to watch always like seeing SS do fight choreography with actors who are not in the business for that reason. Storyline is OK perfectly acceptable to call in a debt from a lethal family man to knock off a few wide boys. All in all this is probably one of Seagals best 10 movies.";

	schema:reviewBody "First a few words about the plot. Steven Seagal is Matt. An ExDetective who is addicted to gambling and also does drink quite a bit. He is divorced and has gambling debts all over town. A mysterious stranger buys all his debt in exchange for Matt's services. Which are to eliminate some bad guys. The final target is someone though who is quite close to Matt.So much so good. It sounds like a regular Steven Seagal movie. It's not though. Let's begin with the production values. Despite costing only about 10 Million  the movie looks pretty good. It seems that Seagal earned his was back in the states as his recent movies are no longer shot in Bulgaria or Romania but rather in the states. The camera work in this movie is top notch. Really stylish. The camerawork alone makes the movie look like it cost about 20 million more than it actually did. The score is also great. Not just for Seagal standards. It actually holds up even against real movies. The acting is also pretty good. In this movie Seagal doesn't look like he really doesn't wanna be there like he did in a few other DTV titles he did. The other extras are also above average. Lance Herniksens short appearance in the movie is also memorable. Like I said this movie looks good enough to be in theaters. Just a few little things here and there could be better. Overall it seems that Seagal got back whatever it was that he lost.So I give this 9 out of 10. I gave Indiana Jones 4 only a 7 out of 10. Both movies I rated in perspective to the previous ones.If you enjoy Seagal even a little you won't be disappointed with this one.".

As the drinksodden excrooked cop Seagal is not exactly revelatory but this is the first film where he's actually bothered attempting to do anything different from his standard formula which sometimes works The Glimmer Man Submerged Into The Sun and often doesn't Attack Force really absolutely rotten to the core so i do commend him on that and also the fact that he has slimmed down considerably from the behemoth who was only filmed from the chest up in his more recent movies. Oh and he even attempts a few kicks in this one something we haven't seen since....hmmmm.....Seagal is supported by two people i never expected to see in one of his films Paul Calderon who'll be familiar to fans of King of New York and Pulp Fiction and Mr Lance Henriksen who sadly only appears in a few scenes. Both add an air of respectability to the proceedings. But this is a Seagal film not Merchant Ivory and it delivers well on the fightingshootingkilling front. An enjoyable load of nonsense but a bit of a comeback for Steven Seagal hopefully it'll end the cycle of appearing is tatty East Europeanset trash. Also please bear in mind that this rates an 8 out of 10 purely as compared against other Seagal vehicles not The Godfather for instance.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought this would be on par with Urban Justice but it wasn't. However it was still pretty good. Seagal needs to take some pep pills and see jenny Craig though. He seems exhausted throughout and needs a stunt man for scenes where he walks more than twenty feet. Some of the movie was unintentionally laughable like how the thirtysomething chicks really dig this oldlooking dude who's worn out all the time. The guy who played his daughter's stepdad did a great job as the villain. Good acting throughout. This coassassin named Blue challenges Seagal to a fight twice and got his butt thoroughly whipped twice. It was kinda funny like throwing around a rag doll. There were some good scenes and the car chase was pretty good. The dialogue was good too especially when Seagal gets irritated and cusses at somebody. I'd recommend this film. It was directed well and was fastpaced. But Steve  before you make another movie  drop the weight and drink some coffee between takes!".

He seems exhausted throughout and needs a stunt man for scenes where he walks more than twenty feet. Some of the movie was unintentionally laughable like how the thirtysomething chicks really dig this oldlooking dude who's worn out all the time. The guy who played his daughter's stepdad did a great job as the villain. Good acting throughout.

Seagal portrays a totally broken hero  losing lots of money when gambling divorced from the mother of his daughter fired from the police drinking too much and he can't even keep promises he gives his daughter. But the world around him is not easy to divide into good guys and bad guys. His former police colleagues are corrupt he doesn't trust his new employer at all and even his new girlfriend has something to hide. Many dark shades of gray thus the story was better than I expected definitely a good progress from Seagal's previous couple of movies.Nevertheless Pistol Whipped couldn't avoid the ridiculous moments typical for a Seagal flick for example when he observes somebody secretly in a bar trying not to be noticed. Yeah right 10 feet tall and staring at the other bloke all the time nobody will notice him. Ah but wouldn't it be less fun without things like that?".

Then he is hired by an old man to kill off some of his enemies. It doesn't sound very good but it's the best Steven Segal film since 'Exit Wounds'. There are 45 small fight scenes. and one that spans to a minute and it is a brief return to the Seagal of the 90's. There is also a wellmade car chase not something very special but a good addition and lots of shootouts. Seagal does all of his fight scenes and there is no voice dubbing. The direction is also a pleasant surprise and slowmo is kept to a minimum. Seagal tries to act but again nothing special overall a decent cast. The best Seagal film in years recommended. 710".
