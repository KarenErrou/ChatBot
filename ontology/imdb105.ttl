I hope that someone who has fallen in love with a girl and lost her would be able to relate to the story. For the same reason I urge all to watch the director's cut version with the alternate ending.But still the movie is not as bad like the critics have reviewed. The whole point of the movie is that this is a story about a 22 year old boy who is acting like a 19 year and a girl who is confused and prefer to suffer than go against her parents. Don't expect super melodrama or cheap comedy or item numbers. I have lost count of friends who have told its their story.I give 7 stars because of the dialogs music camera good performances by support cast.".

	schema:headline " It doesn't offer anything new but isn't that bad at all as rated in the review market.";
	schema:reviewBody "The latest offering from Bollywood once again reveals the dark side of today's Review Market prevailing in the Industry. Where last week's EK MAIN AUR EKK TU didn't really deserved the 34 stars ratings given by many the current week's EKK DEEWANA THA also doesn't deserve the 12 star ratings by most of the critics stating it as a very poor film. So there is evidently a huge imbalance in the reviews which largely get influenced by the production house and stars in the film instead of the product's actual content.Coming to EKK DEEWANA THA it certainly isn't any great piece of art or pathbreaking film with some fresh ideas. It talks about the same ages old love story between two young souls who not only have a slight age difference but they also come from two extremely diverse regional  religion backgrounds causing all the problems. The script can easily be called predictable as we have already seen the same emotional drama umpteen times before on the screen. But still EDT isn't a complete washout as being written in many reputed reviews. It's a sweet film with a refreshing first half which keeps you engaged and entertained till the interval. Plus it also has its moments post intermission resulting in an above average film far better than many craps churned out by some big production houses in the name of Love Stories.Following the current remake trend EKK DEEWANA THA is the Hindi version of director Gautham Menon's earlier 2 hits namely VINNAITHAANDI VARUVAAYAA Tamil and YE MAAYA CHESAVE Telugu. In the initial reels it even reminds you of Kamal HassanRati Agnihotri starrer EK DUJE KE LIYE which also revolved around a love affair in some similar circumstances. But as it progresses it moves on to a different path involving an interesting marriage sequence and its loving results. So what's watchable in this routine lovesaga? The answer comes in the form of Amy Jackson Manu Rishi and to a certain extent Prateik too. However the sole charmer in the film remains Amy who looks stunningly gorgeous especially in the Indian outfits. Though she doesn't get a well defined character who remains confused along with a poor makeup in many scenes still she keeps the viewer hooked on to her innocent beauty till the end and acts well. The second reason why EDT rises above a routine love story is Manu Rishi who holds the film together with his natural style and entertaining one liners particularly in the first half. But if only he had something more to do in the script it would have resulted in a much finer product for the audience. Prateik manages to impress in his casual approach towards the role but the boy seriously needs to work harder on his dance and emotional scenes. At times both his body language and dialogue delivery goes in an awkward zone which hampers the impact of his otherwise fine performance. In the supporting cast Sachin Khedekar performs the best as Prateik's friendly father. Apart from the actors it's the Cinematography taking you on to a Kerala tour and few songs by A. R. Rahman which raise the standard of this routine love story. Yet the maestro isn't in his full form in the movie as he once again gives a soundtrack below expectations with traces of Kabhi Kabhi Aditi Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na in his Hosanna. Actually EDT is a fine film till the intermission and it doesn't disappoint the viewer despite of having a routine storyline mainly due to its fresh pair and Manu. In fact this is the reason why Love Stories have always been there in every decade featuring two unknown faces since they can easily make an instant connection with the public and can deliver a Hit. But EDT is not able to reach that crescendo due to its pretty weak second half and a prolonged climax which eventually ends on an All is Well note unexpectedly. It would have been a different film altogether if it had a more realistic climax where there was no reunion of the lovers but they still remained friends living their separate lives in two different parts of the world.The writers falter in a big way as they are not able to define the character of the girl in a justified manner. Yes a girl in love remains always in a dilemma to choose between her boyfriend and her parents. But the writers here give no proper justification for their parting away from each other all of a sudden. Moreover it all starts dragging in the last 30 minutes without any purpose which fails to leave any kind of loving impact on the viewers. In my opinion the loveaffair in the film should have ended right there in the Taj Mahal corridors showing a married Amy saying good bye to Prateik and the film should have ended with everyone praising the directorial venture of Pratiek being loudly cheered by Manu Rishi standing along with him in the theater. That would have been a more ideal and realistic ending of a tragic love story as I see it.Anyhow in its present version EKK DEEWANA THA is a sweet film with a fine first half and a beautiful Amy which surely can be watched once without any doubt. So if you are really interested in love stories then please forget all the negative reviews you might have read about the movie as it certainly isn't that bad at all as being projected in those well publicized writeups.".

	onyx:emotionText "The latest offering from Bollywood once again reveals the dark side of today's Review Market prevailing in the Industry. Where last week's EK MAIN AUR EKK TU didn't really deserved the 34 stars ratings given by many the current week's EKK DEEWANA THA also doesn't deserve the 12 star ratings by most of the critics stating it as a very poor film. So there is evidently a huge imbalance in the reviews which largely get influenced by the production house and stars in the film instead of the product's actual content.Coming to EKK DEEWANA THA it certainly isn't any great piece of art or pathbreaking film with some fresh ideas. It talks about the same ages old love story between two young souls who not only have a slight age difference but they also come from two extremely diverse regional  religion backgrounds causing all the problems. The script can easily be called predictable as we have already seen the same emotional drama umpteen times before on the screen.

And people who follows Tamil movies believes that Tamil movies are big time ahead of Hindi Cinema. So we see a lot of frustration from those audiences who watched either of the two early versions of Ekk Deewana Tha! However I will recommend to those who loves romantic bollywood films and hadn't seen any of those early two versions should watch. I really loved the movie though it have some technical issues. Pratiek Babbar did a really nice job with the leading role of Sachin a wanna be film maker who makes himself a successful one at the end of the story. He falls in love with his neighbor Jassi and chases his love with the struggle of being a filmmaker. The movie has lots of good music by A R Rahman. Amy Jackson played the role of Jassi and did an OK job with her Bollywood debut. She is a stunning British beauty and its really a treat watching her on screen! Kerala is another beauty of the film with some lovely cinematography.Director Gautham Menon did his job handsomely keeping a good slow pace without any monotonous pause till the end. Overall a good 710 romantic bollywood film with some good cinematography and music!".

	schema:headline " A simple feel good and realistic love saga true to it's cultural roots as well as modernism";
	schema:reviewBody "In this Gautham Menon's remake of his own tamil filmSachin a young mechanical engineering graduate now aspires to make it to bollywood. During all of these struggles he falls in love with Jessie the daughter of his landlord. Now Sachin tries to strike a balance between his career struggles and Jessie's situation. But Jessie belongs to a strict conservative family and not only that she belongs to a different religion. The fact that this film failed at the box office is disappointing but not entirely shocking. A relatively new cast slow pace nothing over the top nothing larger than life the film came and went and nobody seemed to notice. The only real popular names attached to this film are those of the maestro ARR and the lyrical genius Javed Akhtar. However what really upset me was the fact that this film received a lot of bashing from the critics as well. That is what compelled me to write this review. Even though the title of the film suggests that the efforts of the protagonist would be extravagant it suggests that this film would be just like countless other cinematic portrayals of love flamboyant and something which looks good on screen but would be very difficult to find in real life. However in reality the film is simple feel good and quite realistic. The actions of the characters are inconsistent but that is what makes it real. The characters are just those which each and every one of us can find all around us. A friend acting as a sidekick middle class parents critical of one's career choice a sarcastic dad a confused girl not really sure of what stance can be taken. Talking about inconsistencies Jessie suddenly tells Sachin she doesn't love him anymore previously she told him that she loves him immensely. Jessie can wear a sari but at another day she can wear jeans. Sachin who is mad for Jessie doesn't want to leave her side for one moment suddenly tells Jessie not to come to him and wait for his shoot schedule to end. All these inconsistencies aren't the film's weaknesses as what critics would think they actually make the film realistic and believable. Because in reality we all are inconsistent with weaknesses we all keep changing our mindsets and attitudes. Sachin even though a passionate lover doesn't perform over the top acts like deciding to change his religion or his career for Jessie just what happens in many other epic love stories. He instead does what a sane person would do try to balance things logically and see what happens. Even the action sequences are simple and not overdone. A few punches and that's it no blowing up of cars or bhai's punches. No taking off of shirts. It's simple. The cultural portrayals are good and mostly realistic. The Mumbai culture and lifestyle is shown appropriately. An office going girl and a vela wannabe film director boy who has completed engineering probably due to family pressures but whose heart belongs somewhere else. The scenes in Kerala are shot beautifully the cinematography is brilliant. So the film to a large deal is also filled with the ambiance of Kerala. This adds to the feel good factor of the film. Another thing which the critics tried to mock was the slow pace of the film however it was essential as the film wanted to show the journey the entire path that the relationship of Jessie and Sachin took from the point when they were strangers to the point they lived happily ever after. It is still cut down a great deal from the original Tamil version many plot points being integrated in songs e.g. the moving of Sachin's family to their own new house. These are small details which add more meaning to the film which the critics blatantly ignored or missed out. This film doesn't tell what hasn't been told before in cinema there are countless other films which tread on the same topics and themes e.g. parents not agreeing with marriage an abusive brother etc. But what this film does differently is presenting all these things in a simple feel good and realistic manner. There are a few weaknesses e.g. a somewhat disjointed screenplay from the moment Jessie leaves onwards. However it is covered up as the film has a soul. The dialogues are crisp. Prateik puts in a brilliant performance Amy Jackson is good. ARR is at his best as both the songs and the background score are heart touching and magical. Overall don't look at the deprecatory critic reviews or the poor box office performance give this film a watch it deserves one.".

	onyx:emotionText "In this Gautham Menon's remake of his own tamil filmSachin a young mechanical engineering graduate now aspires to make it to bollywood. During all of these struggles he falls in love with Jessie the daughter of his landlord. Now Sachin tries to strike a balance between his career struggles and Jessie's situation. But Jessie belongs to a strict conservative family and not only that she belongs to a different religion. The fact that this film failed at the box office is disappointing but not entirely shocking. A relatively new cast slow pace nothing over the top nothing larger than life the film came and went and nobody seemed to notice. The only real popular names attached to this film are those of the maestro ARR and the lyrical genius Javed Akhtar. However what really upset me was the fact that this film received a lot of bashing from the critics as well. That is what compelled me to write this review. Even though the title of the film suggests that the efforts of the protagonist would be extravagant it suggests that this film would be just like countless other cinematic portrayals of love flamboyant and something which looks good on screen but would be very difficult to find in real life. However in reality the film is simple feel good and quite realistic. The actions of the characters are inconsistent but that is what makes it real. The characters are just those which each and every one of us can find all around us. A friend acting as a sidekick middle class parents critical of one's career choice a sarcastic dad a confused girl not really sure of what stance can be taken. Talking about inconsistencies Jessie suddenly tells Sachin she doesn't love him anymore previously she told him that she loves him immensely. Jessie can wear a sari but at another day she can wear jeans. Sachin who is mad for Jessie doesn't want to leave her side for one moment suddenly tells Jessie not to come to him and wait for his shoot schedule to end. All these inconsistencies aren't the film's weaknesses as what critics would think they actually make the film realistic and believable. Because in reality we all are inconsistent with weaknesses we all keep changing our mindsets and attitudes. Sachin even though a passionate lover doesn't perform over the top acts like deciding to change his religion or his career for Jessie just what happens in many other epic love stories. He instead does what a sane person would do try to balance things logically and see what happens. Even the action sequences are simple and not overdone. A few punches and that's it no blowing up of cars or bhai's punches. No taking off of shirts. It's simple. The cultural portrayals are good and mostly realistic. The Mumbai culture and lifestyle is shown appropriately. An office going girl and a vela wannabe film director boy who has completed engineering probably due to family pressures but whose heart belongs somewhere else. The scenes in Kerala are shot beautifully the cinematography is brilliant. So the film to a large deal is also filled with the ambiance of Kerala. This adds to the feel good factor of the film. Another thing which the critics tried to mock was the slow pace of the film however it was essential as the film wanted to show the journey the entire path that the relationship of Jessie and Sachin took from the point when they were strangers to the point they lived happily ever after. It is still cut down a great deal from the original Tamil version many plot points being integrated in songs e.g. the moving of Sachin's family to their own new house. These are small details which add more meaning to the film which the critics blatantly ignored or missed out. This film doesn't tell what hasn't been told before in cinema there are countless other films which tread on the same topics and themes e.g. parents not agreeing with marriage an abusive brother etc. But what this film does differently is presenting all these things in a simple feel good and realistic manner. There are a few weaknesses e.g. a somewhat disjointed screenplay from the moment Jessie leaves onwards. However it is covered up as the film has a soul. The dialogues are crisp. Prateik puts in a brilliant performance Amy Jackson is good. ARR is at his best as both the songs and the background score are heart touching and magical. Overall don't look at the deprecatory critic reviews or the poor box office performance give this film a watch it deserves one.";

Not to be too cynical about the movie but it doesn't really live up to its make! In fact why did they remake this movie at all? And if it was hit in Tamil and Telugu it would have surely better written dialogues.The script  is by far the most annoying! Not only does it not have any coherence the story is also story less. There are other films which do not have a story  Chalo Dilli but have had better outcomes in terms of the dialogues and the direction. But this one fails in all counts. The boy falls in love with just one look and chases the girl. She being Christian and a Malayalee the boy  a Hindu from Mumbai chases her to Allepy and witnesses her rejecting her marriage. The idea behind it was that she had something towards the boy which she couldn't express. Finally the expression comes and this is the part which is the most 'not thought' after. There could have been better dialogues at least. The effect of a Bollywood 'romancatainer' is just not there in this one.The Actors  are as fresh as new college students needed training. They sure light up the space cause there is nothing else to the movie that keeps me tied to it. Pratiek has done reasonably well and given that he is starting his career is worth the shot. Moreover fresh faces are welcome. But fresh faces just for namesake are where the movie again fails. Amy is not at all a 'Malayalee'. She was searching for expressions the entire movie. This was not a movie where her charms would work through her super model figure! This needed expressions and dialogue delivery. The role of Manu Rishi was refreshing and was the only welltailored character. The direction  Barring the scenery in God's own Country the film has little directorial skills to offer. A director's vision is something which comes out of the movie. Rather than aping the previous movies if he would have added something which has a better context it would have been better. If on the other hand he was not interested to change it he could have still checked whether it is still coherent and the story flows! Alas nothing was done and nothing came out! For me the film has no other layers to figure out. The story could have made better sense and had the intentions of bringing out a familial aspect to love stories but it never reached its own aspirations. We would have to wait for 2 states adaptation for this issue to be re screened again! Lets hope they treat it well next time.Watch More movies for now!...Don't give up so soon!".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER Ekk Dewanna Tha is a routine love story which again falls in the typical section of Bollywood love stories. As usual Bollywood copies either Hollywood or Tollywood. And this time its Tollywood. A hit Tamil movie is remade in Hindi. The movie is actually worth watching because it is better than all those silly action movies like Bodyguard but Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu beats this any day. The problem with the movie is the romance. Being a romantic cinema where a they can't marry because of parents the story has clichs. The romance isn't convincing the locations of the film are good Kerela is a wonderful location for a romantic movie. But the chemistry of Prateik and Amy Jackson isn't good. Pratiek has barely done any movies but his acting is natural. Here his acting is above average but what can he do if the script is bad. The storytelling process is routine and after a few moments the movies drags and gets boring. The climax is okay better than most movies. But the problem is typical and I believe the tamil cinema was better than this. Acting wise Prateik does a damn good job but he needs to choose better films. Amy Jackson has the looks has the beauty but her acting isn't at her best level I definitely thought she could've done better. Supporting actors like Sachin Khedkar fill the bill and they provide some decent comedy when the romantic venture bore. The film is dragged too much and a few people were bored and left the hall. If Prateik wants to improve he must choose a movie like Dumb Maaro Dumb or Dhobi Ghaat where he was awesome and the movies were good too. The movie might click but according to many critics and based on the box office opening the movie has enough chances to be a flop. But it won't be a disaster it is still watchable but I don't recommend. But the one awesome thing the movie has is the music. Hosanna is an awesome song and the Suno Lo Zaara is also pretty good. The other songs are good and this is one advantage but the film is a bit messed up though supporting actors do a good job.".

The Four Days of Naples was released in 1962 and is shown occasionally on Turner Classic Movies in Italian with English subtitles.What's most interesting about this film is that director Loy follows many characters and subplots and often fails to resolve them because they become lost in the chaos of the housetohouse battle within the city. Frank Wolff Desert Assault is Salvatore who loves Maria Lea Massari even though she has married a rich man. The two wind up fighting along side one another Gian Maria Volonte is the Captain who helps organize a partisan resistance Aldo Giuffre The Good the Bad and the Ugly is one member of an Italian artillery unit which becomes embroiled in the siege and Enzo Turco Anzio is a Blackshirt who is taken prisoner despite his Fascist convictions. Every member of the ensemble cast is passionate and utterly convincing. Many were virtually unknown at the time of production and became big stars in Italy within the next few years.Director Loy shoots his film with a documentary style. Some shots are wellcrafted though and give the audience a new perspective on the action. One long pan from a rooftop from which partisans are firing on the Germans shows how the men move from street to street without any cutting at all. The blackandwhite cinematography is utterly fantastic. Closeups of faces deliver all of the drama that dialog simply cannot convey.The film brings the viewer inside what occupation and resistance do the civilian population of a city. At one point the Germans drive the citizens out of one quarter so that they can occupy it forcing people to move in with strangers on the other side of the city. Later they attempt to conscript Italian men into their labor force which is what sparks the uprising. The camera follows us into individual homes and family situations which are ripped apart by the affects of war. He then takes us to massive crowds as they riot in the streets. The scope of battle is excellently captured as are the cramped alleys and rooms from which the citizens must fight.There a number of standout vignettes the Neapolitans throwing furniture from their windows atop the heads of Nazi soldiers in a narrow alleyway one sequence in which a number of teens escape a reform school to join the fight a prisonernegotiation scene in which things go unexpectedly and several Italian civilians are caught in a crossfire the scene in which the Italian men are taken in trucks to be conscripted only to have their wives overwhelm the German guards. All of these scenes convey a spirit of freedom aided by Carlo Rustichelli's rousing score.The Four Days of Naples is a wellcrafted drama intended to be taken seriously unlike many Italian war films which would follow a few years later. This is an inspiring drama of courage and determination definitely a mustsee for any fan of war films or the Italian cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Four Days of Naples is an interesting film in that although it was made in 1962 it looks like it was made just after the war. That's because many buildings show bomb damage. Could they have sat that way since the war or did they blow up a few buildings to add to the realism? I don't know but the film sure got the look right.The film is set in 1943. The Allies have invaded Sicily and are on the move northward. In nearby Naples word arrives that the Italian army has surrenderedand the residents are thrilled as it looks like the war is over for them. However the Germans go immediately from allies to enslavers and they begin committing atrocities on the Italians. Soon the Neopolitans realize that unless they fight back they will diethus begins four days of bloody fighting between mostly civilians and the German army throughout the streets of the town.Because this was a battle to save he city it's made up of lots and lots of separate vignettes all strung together. Some are very compellingsuch as the boys of the reform school leaving to join in the fighteven though many look to be only about 10 or even younger. Others are more bizarre as there are TONS of women running about screaming and getting in the way of the fighting. About the only thing that did not ring true in these stories was when they showed a couple people pulling the pins out of grenades with their teethsomething that only occurs in movies and never in real life you'd lose your teeth doing this.This film works very well. Of course much of this is because it was welldirected but I also loved the neorealistic style though most films in this style were made a decade or more earlierwith nonactors playing the parts of the citizens. While the film could have been like an American epic such as The Longest Daystarstudded throughout instead the real folks made it all come alivelike we are really watching the battles unfold. Realismrealistic looking deaths heroism occasional cowardicerealism from start to finish.By the way although it's a very good film I would really love to see it recaptioned. That's because like many films captioned many years ago the people doing this didn't feel a need to caption everything the people said or caption it word for word. I dislike this intenselyas would most film purists. I've seen much worse captioningbut also much much better.By the way you can't blame the film makers but the tanks used in the film were modern tanks like Americanbuilt Walker Bulldogsnot vintage German tanks. There just aren't that many Panzer tanks left and they certainly weren't going to risk the few possibly still available making a film.".

There is a 1979 book with the same title also telling of the uprising that is NOT the source of this film.  According to summaries the book says that the Naples street boys instigated and led the rebellion. Not in this film however which focuses on adults and has many wrenching scenes of mothers and children husbands and wives torn apart.  The ensemble cast is passionate and convincing.  Unlike the other commenter who said the film is an argument against war this is really an argument for standing up and fighting against those who would treat you as slaves which the NAZIs did and which led to the uprising.  Great film!".

It's cinema of heroism of selfless heroes of good versus evil.

Loy makes a splendid use of this landscape of debris especially when he films deserted narrow streets and wide piazzas. This stillness before the fighting sometimes is more suffocating than the action. The movie hinges a lot on suspense we keep waiting for the outbreak and Loy sadistically forces us to wait and wait. When the uprising starts we're like Naples' population unable to hold any longer.The movie is violent showing not just violence aimed at the body but one that assaults our and the characters' feelings and values. Loy shows intense scenes of fighting but it's the quiet moments that reveal the brutality of war when a mother gives her last piece of food to her child when people search for their loved ones amongst dead bodies when families are torn apart. The movie works so well because it shows why war is both physically and psychologically repulsive.We've all seen war movies. But for me the best aren't the ones that have the best sound editing or the most convincing action scenes. That's just technical improvement. I think the best war movies are the ones that paradoxically show eternal human values. The best like Platoon Merry Christmas Breaker Morant or The Four Days of Naples engage us with ideas about human dignity friendship freedom and altruism. For that reason The Four Days of Naples is a timeless masterpiece of cinema.".

The whining can grate on you after awhile and that was watching it even in segments! Both sides are pretty pathetic in this one I would imagine other ethnic races such as the Greeks and Slavs would have little sympathy for a population that picked its sides based on whichever gave it the most comfortable lot in life. Granted I guess most populations stray that way towards comfort but the Italians in WW2 seemed to be the masters at it. You wonder what their true motivations are fighting against tyranny or Allied dollars I guess both but it sure took them long enough to get to that point! I kind of think they were pretty happy under the Nazi thumb until the Allies were knocking at the doorstep then they were heroes. Made less than 20 years after WW2 the Italians a fiercely nationalistic nation like 96 of the world needed some flag waving and some story to tell that reflected something good on their side from WW2 and this is an example of that. Similar to Is Paris Burning if you want to see more movies in this vein. 6 of 10 a feel good movie for an Italian nation needing a boost in it's national pride. I prefer the 70's movie Seven Beauties for another side of the Italian role in the war.".

	schema:headline " This What If Comedy Is Good For Some Real Laughs";
	schema:reviewBody "Magic as well as evil  is afoot in 12th Century France and when the two are combined to effect the sinister scheme of an unscrupulous individual the result is a comedic journey for a Nobleman and his lackey as they are transported into the 21st Century in Just Visiting' directed by JeanMarie Poire and starring Jean Reno and Christina Applegate.  Count Thibault Reno is about to marry Princess Rosalind Applegate daughter of King Henry Richard Bremmer and his Queen Sarah Badel but at a prenuptial banquet the Earl of Warwick Robert Glenister who covets the fair Rosalind coerces a witch Valerie Griffiths into casting a spell that will enable him to usurp Thibault and make Rosalind his own.  The plan goes gravely awry however and Thibault subsequently engages the talents of an English Wizard Malcolm McDowell to set things aright.  But the Wizard proceeds to muck it up even worse sending Thibault and his slave Andre le Pate Christian Clavier into a Tunnel of time' from which they ultimately emerge in Chicago 2001 where they encounter Julia Malfete also Applegate the spitting image of Rosalind who turns out to be a direct descendant of Thibault.  And it becomes the task of the Nobleman Thibault to find a way back to his own time.  In the meantime he and Andre attempt to negotiate this world of the future with a Medieval mindset that puts them at odds with the inanimate objects and humans that surround them.  And it becomes a trial by fire for the brave Count and a laugh riot of uproarious proportions for the audience.This strangerinastrangeland fishoutofwater scenario has been done before to be sure but it's given a fresh face here compliments of Poire who sets a good pace and keeps the story on track and the talents and impeccable comedic timing of his cast especially Clavier and Reno who play so well off of one another.  Much of what transpires is predictable the way Thibault and Andre react to a modern city replete with technology and specifically things like automobiles light switches and television but they always manage to take it one step further which makes the humor spontaneous and genuinely funny.  Reno is perfect as Thibault playing it straight and allowing the humor to naturally evolve from the character's reaction to a situation rather than going for the purely physical humor.  Reno in fact demonstrates a real talent for acting through reacting which makes his character believable and adds to the humor of the film.  He never allows Thibault to lose that 12th Century logic willing to attest to his own nobility for example to anyone who will listen and backing it up with a verbal inventory of his assets which includes things like fifty barrels of olives and of course Andre. It's not a performance that requires a lot of depth but for the film to work it had to be done right and with precision and Reno succeeds admirably on both counts.Clavier on the other hand goes straight for the jugular with an allout assault of slapstick and physical humor that takes it right to the edge and works perfectly in effecting what was intended  He makes you laugh out loud.  Reminiscent of a cross between Peter Sellers' Clouseau though not as subtle and the best of Monty Python Clavier creates a memorable character who as the property' of Thibault gives a real perspective and context to the humor of the story.  Some of his discoveries' of the modern world will have you rolling on the floor.  And again the fact that he plays the character straight and not just for' laughs adds significantly to the overall humor of the film.Christina Applegate provides a welcome presence as RosalindJulia and while not a stretch for her as an actor by any means she lends a quality to the film that could be easily overlooked but would be quite apparent as a missing element without her.  She has a natural charismatic manner that makes her endearing and sympathetic and it's a good solid performance through which she creates a credible well rounded character.The supporting cast includes Matt Ross Hunter Tara Reid Angelique Bridgette Wilson Amber John Aylward Byron George Plimpton Dr. Brady Bill Bailey Thibault's Father and Clare Welch Thibault's Mother.  A comedy that successfully blends the fine art of comedic subtlety with physical gags Just Visiting' is everything a comedy should be  Funny and entertaining.  And it does it without venturing into overthetop Farrelly Brothers territory or by employing the abstract brand of hilarity often offered by the Coen Brothers.  It's a film that succeeds on it's own merits and does it splendidly.  It's a funny one you don't want to miss and that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 810.".

The remake is of course not on par with the original which is a perfect comedy. The U.S. version is much duller and marred by several things such as Jean Reno being too old to successfully reprise his role and many jokes simply not being very funny.It gains however on two important counts. First Malcolm McDowell's wizard who has a much larger and more interesting part in this movie than the original wizard did in the first movie. Second Christina Applegate's character. She is surprisingly good and a delight to watch. She's never been a terrible actress but here she's extraordinary. She plays a kind of goodhearted intelligent and yet naive character that to my knowledge is quite different from the other characters she's played. Where she's often been an airhead bimbo here she's genuinely appealing even endearing.It still does detract from the movie that to a great degree it merely goes through the motions of the original movie trying to mimic the jokes and japes and very often failing miserably. Still and all it's worth watching and is better than it might have been.I rate this one 7 out of 10. You should see the original though which is far more inspired and also gives a great impression of spontaneity. I rate the original version 10 out of 10. It's that good.".

Andre is very funny and it is great to see him realize that he can be a free man and finally stand up for himself. It helps us realize how inhumane the treatment of slaves were in ancient history. Helps us realize how much we take for granted in the 21st century too.

	schema:headline " they're visiting? They'd better going away and never coming back";
	schema:reviewBody "When a French movie is a huge commercial success it's often followed by one or a few sequels. Sometimes it happens that an American version is made. It was the case for un indien dans la ville a movie made by Herv Palud in 1994 and transposed in an American version which was released in 1997. But these American versions are generally a waste of time and why not? a loss of money. This is what you could put forward by watching this listless and not very inspired remake of the French movie les visiteurs. Here JeanMarie Poir contents with taking back the funniest elements that assured the visitors'success sometimes in similar circumstances. For example the curator of the museum in which our visitors appear replaced the black postman in 1993. So the comical effects don't work and the movie creates very few surprises. Concerning the cast well it's quite disparate if Jean Reno keeps on talking with smart and noble terms he seems less imposing and authoritarian than he was eight years ago. Christine Applegate is far away from Valrie Lemercier's performance whereas Matt Ross hasn't got Christian Bujeau's furor and exasperation when he's got to face the visitors' disasters. Nevertheless Christian Clavier is always entertaining especially when he's provoking disasters in spite of very few new gags. In another hand when we learn that Matt Ross aims at grabbing his wife's fortune with a little help from his lover the movie becomes quite conventional. But with Reno's presence and bravery Applegate will know how to make her husband leave. At the end the movie lacks of punch and rhythm. It's not a bad movie but simply an useless remake. It's high time Reno and Clavier had a welldeserved rest.".

	onyx:emotionText "When a French movie is a huge commercial success it's often followed by one or a few sequels. Sometimes it happens that an American version is made. It was the case for un indien dans la ville a movie made by Herv Palud in 1994 and transposed in an American version which was released in 1997. But these American versions are generally a waste of time and why not? a loss of money. This is what you could put forward by watching this listless and not very inspired remake of the French movie les visiteurs. Here JeanMarie Poir contents with taking back the funniest elements that assured the visitors'success sometimes in similar circumstances. For example the curator of the museum in which our visitors appear replaced the black postman in 1993. So the comical effects don't work and the movie creates very few surprises. Concerning the cast well it's quite disparate if Jean Reno keeps on talking with smart and noble terms he seems less imposing and authoritarian than he was eight years ago. Christine Applegate is far away from Valrie Lemercier's performance whereas Matt Ross hasn't got Christian Bujeau's furor and exasperation when he's got to face the visitors' disasters. Nevertheless Christian Clavier is always entertaining especially when he's provoking disasters in spite of very few new gags. In another hand when we learn that Matt Ross aims at grabbing his wife's fortune with a little help from his lover the movie becomes quite conventional. But with Reno's presence and bravery Applegate will know how to make her husband leave. At the end the movie lacks of punch and rhythm. It's not a bad movie but simply an useless remake. It's high time Reno and Clavier had a welldeserved rest.";

Thankfully they didn't put someone like Jim Carrey in that role he could not have carried it off with his frantic mannerisms. I had no problem with the ApplegateReno love story  remember the time it's set in. I had no problem suspending my disbelief his accent and Gallic charm worked for me! Frankly I enjoyed all the performances. It's rare that I laugh out loud but this one did it for me and I'm not a fan of slapstick. This one was better than most. I thought the movie moved along well  held my interest right to the end. I highly recommend it.".

The film does appear to be rather dull and silly but then again Men in Black 2 is much worse in it's presentation than Just Visiting.

I enjoyed this film more.This had a good story but it still lacked and some parts did not make any sense.To note...the very beginning.There should NOT have been a voice over...there was no need simply because the voice over didn't follow through to the rest of the movie nor did it offer any real detail except bad humor for the first few minutes. The intro would be much more funny without the voice over.Second note...the dungeon scene...in which jail do the PRISONERS lock themselves in?The time travel sequence was good but if the two characters drank from the same cup why didn't they disappear the same way?Why did they time travellers have to wake up in a museum castle setting? Why couldn't they wake up in a mall or a restaurant or even a city park? Why did it have to be the same element? It would have been way more funnier if they would've woken up in a fountain or in the middle of the airport runway or a swimming pool or bowling alley.When people travel through time...why do their clothes come too? If their clothes come why not the furnishing around them? Why not dirt? I STRONGLY feel that if there will be time travel films made....and  there will be many made why does the personal property of the traveller arrive with them but not articles that are lying beside them?Why not have time travellers arrive naked??? And then be really stuck in a situation...besides being stranded? Imagine...when you are lost in the woods wouldn't you be more freaked out if you were naked and unarmed?The arriving at the house scene had too much repetition. It was good but over done. Even the female lead should have known that somebody who has no idea how to work a lighswitch should be taught the basics of operating other features in a modern home.Why did the servent have to be so clumsy? He could be stupid...but even though he may not be bright....there was no need to be totally idiotic to how things work as played out in the kitchen scene.Why did he have to be knocking stuff over constantly?If you had strange visitors as these 2 characters...why would you go to the classiest restaurant in town...why wouldn't you just order a pizza and deal with their ridiculous adventures at home till things became more stable? Just to get cheap laughs? This could have been done at home with more laughs if more time was put into building it.Tara Reid is a great performer but doesn't have enough screen time or character definition for a good performance in here aside from being a tart. I love you Tara. More screen time for Tara!!!!The knight should have ventured onto his own for a longer period and should have explored more of this new world. There could've been more exploits for him to enjoy or fear.Another 30 minutes of film could make this an exceptional great comedy if more time was taken to it. There may have been a different script then what was originally cut and printed...something that would've lasted longer.I gather that this movie was geared at young children and for them this would be good time to waste in a theatre but for an audience from mid teens to adults it fell short.All my reviews are written from a screenwriter and director's point of view. Consideration is given for budgeting and script cuts but even this final should have been more carefully scrutinized.Imagine the knight and his sidekick trying to drive a bike or a car taking the subway alone dealing with gangs or police while trying to make an escape going into shopping malls and getting hoarded by people with demands for autographs or questionable stares going to order food and trying to pay with 900 year old gold coins...so much possibility.Since the knight had a sword there should have been somewhere for him to use it...in escaping the police or defending somebody from harm other than just using it to destroy a car which was not even bearing down on him.Bathing is not new to people so why would time travellers bath in their clothes...I can understand the fact that they dropped all sorts of bathroom chemicals into the tub but why wear the clothes while getting washed? Why not try to use a hair dryer and then bring it in the tub and have somebody save their butt just in time before being electrocuted?It had so much potential but lacked so much product. You journey 900 years or so...you want to experiment but you're not stupid...you're cautious.Future screenwriters...think of things like this when you create your masterpiece.Out of 10 stars I give it 7 for effort and because the characters were well casted.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is obviously designed as a Jolson vehicle. It is pretty obvious that the star came first and everything else followed.Despite being made in 1928 the film holds up remarkably well today the humour being one aspect that hasn't dated. Jolson sings Sonny Boy to great effect three times although he puts so much emotion into it that I was left wanting him to sing is straight just once. The film may seem oversentimental but if you engage with this and look at it from the point of view of a contemporary audience you will enjoy it more and the film's shock ending is in my opinion one of the bravest I have seen Hollywood do. In fact the only shock endings which I think compare with this are Terry Gilliam's Brazil or Doctor Who Earthshock.The supporting performances are sterling but there's no other actor who has the Charisma of Jolson. It's apparent to me that nowadays the film's leading lady Josephine Dunn playing a singer would have been given one or two songs to sing but the producers rightly realised that the audience was there to see Jolson and Jolson alone.The film is also of historical interest being one of the first talkies. It's apparent that synchronised sound is used sparingly and like its nearcontemporary The Jazz Singer the opening parts use caption slides in place of speech.Enjoy it for its Jazz age settings the grand costumes Miss Dunn's gowns are particularly exquisite and of course for Jolson's singing.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE SINGING FOOL Warner Brothers 1928 directed by Lloyd Bacon is a worthy followup to the historic first talkie of THE JAZZ SINGER WB 1927 starring Broadway headliner Al Jolson. Upon its release THE SINGING FOOL reportedly broke all box office records to date until that record was broken 11 years later with the Civil War epic of Gone With the Wind Selznick 1939. But in spite of its popularity with the public way back when THE JAZZ SINGER remains well known to cinema history while THE SINGING FOOL today is virtually forgotten which is unfortunate because it's a much better movie than THE JAZZ SINGER. The one thing both movies have in common other than being musical dramas is that they are both parttalkies with THE SINGING FOOL featuring more songs and dialog than its predecessor.The story opens in the silent film tradition with title cards and Vitaphone orchestral score at Blackie Joe's Arthur Housman caf where Al Stone Al Jolson works as a waiter title cards read By occupation a waiter by ambition a songwriter by nature a singing fool. Al is hopelessly in love with a pretty blonde named Molly Winton Josephine Dunn a coldhearted but ambitious singer who entertains at the club. Also employed at Blackie Joe's is Grace Betty Bronson a petite cigarette girl who secretly loves Al. Because Molly shows her lack of interest in Al and his proposed love song written especially for her Al decides to impress her by going out taking the spotlight and introducing his song to the patrons. The song makes such an impression with Louis Marcus Edward Martindel a famous producer visiting the club with his guests that he offers Al a contract to perform on Broadway. After learning of this Molly suddenly takes an interest in Al who accepts Marcus's offer on the promise that he could take Molly along with him. Over the next few years Al and Molly now married become successful headliners with Molly scoring success singing the songs Al has written for her. Al opens up a nightclub where he not only manages but is its star singing attraction with the catch phrase I'm going to sing you a thousand songs. What makes Al's personal life so complete is his little threeyearold son he calls Sonny Boy David Davey Lee. But all that changes when Molly becomes bored with Al and finds herself having a secret rendezvous with Al's friend John Reed Howes while he entertains at the club. Due to Molly's extravagant spending which puts Al heavily in debt the marriage falls apart causing Molly to walk out on Al taking Sonny Boy with her. After Al hits the skids he struggles to restore his career.THE SINGING FOOL features many memorable tunes all sung by Jolson compliments of songwriters Lew Brown B.G. DeSylva and Ray Henderson including It All Depends on You I'm Sitting on Top of the World The Spaniard That Blighted My Life written by Billy Merson There's A Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder Golden Gate Sonny Boy sung by Jolson to Davey Lee in front of a Christmas tree Keep Smiling at Trouble Sonny Boy reprise and Sonny Boy finale with Jolson in blackface. Of all the songs written for the film most of which became Jolson standards Sonny Boy took the honors as its Number One song of the year almost outdoing Jolson's signature song of Mammy. As for The Spaniard That Blighted My Life no movie print today is known to exist containing this song and number. However in the motion picture soundtrack album to THE SINGING FOOL distributed in musicrecord stores in 1981 featuring a still photo of Jolson in Mexican attire of that number on cover compliments of TAKE TWO RECORDS DOES include that missing song along with the closing instrumental Sonny Boy theme song at the end of the soundtrack not available in today's movie print.In spite of THE SINGING FOOL being overly sentimental at times it succeeds without going overboard. Jolson's occasional bad acting during the dramatic moments is evident here especially during the talking segments when he is arguing with his wife for example but appears more relaxed and natural when he gets his chance to be funny in reciting witty dialog and singing those lively tunes. Jolson's bonding with Davey Lee comes across in a believable manner on screen. One particular segment where Al gets to bid goodbye to his Sonny Boy in Central Park before the boy leaves for Paris with his mother and her lover ranks one of the most tender moments ever captured on film. What makes this scene so memorable is that it is done with the underscoring to Sonny Boy with dialog between father and son presented only on screen through wellwritten title cards. Aside from Davey Lee almost succeeding in becoming another Jackie Coogan a popular boy actor of the 1920s which never happened there is Betty Bronson best known to silent movie lovers as PETER PAN Paramount 1925 in one of her first adult movie roles giving a convincing tearful performance. Sadly her voice sometimes doesn't register clearly on the soundtrack which at times her spoken dialog gets drowned out during the music underscoring. The same also happens with Josephine Dunn. Also in the supporting cast are Robert Emmett O'Connor as Bill Cline and Arthur Housman famous for his numerous drunken characters in many comedy shorts and features giving in a rare sober performance.In spite of its age THE SINGING FOOL still ranks one of the best feature films made during the dawn of sound. It can be seen and studied when presented on Turner Classic Movies. ".

The movie is about threequarters talkie one quarter silent. Aside from the jarring of sudden swings from spoken dialog to title cards and the camera fluidity of Bacon's direction in some of the silent sequences versus the static camera setups of the sound the movie succeeds in holding attention thanks to the charisma of its two lead players Al Jolson and the lovely Josephine Dunn who alas was unable to capitalize on her success here because she was then cast in a series of either indifferent or silent vehicles when the public was screaming for sound. Within a year she ended up in support slots. In this movie despite the magnitude and importance of her role Miss Dunn is actually billed under Betty Bronson who not only has a minuscule part but a totally inept voice that lacks projection. She seems to be whispering her lines some of her words are inaudible rather than speaking them. But never mind all the film's audio defects were of no importance to moviegoers. They loved Jolson's fullblooded singing and the sheer novelty of sound. Initial domestic rentals topped 5 million supplanting the 4.5 million takings of 1921's Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. It wasn't until 1938 that this record was broken by Walt Disney's truly colossal 8 million domestic gross for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.".

	schema:headline " The first talking picture many people ever saw";
	schema:reviewBody "The Singing Fool is relatively unknown compared to the previous year's The Jazz Singer probably because it was the first feature film with synchronized dialogue. However 1928's The Singing Fool is important for a number of reasons. For one it was the first talking picture many people ever saw. Remember that in order to exhibit a talking picture special equipment had to be installed in the theater and theater owners weren't sure enough of the future success of talking pictures to invest in that equipment until well after The Jazz Singer came and went. Also The Singing Fool was the top box office draw of 1928. In fact with the Great Depression just over the horizon no film made more money until Gone with the Wind in 1939. Finally it is one of the very few talking pictures that survive from the year 1928 due to the ease of breakage of the Vitaphone discs.The story behind The Singing Fool is not that remarkable. It is overly sentimental and you can see from the start exactly where it is headed. Jolson plays singing waiter Al Stone who loves snobby Molly a singer at the night spot where he works. Likewise Al is loved in secret by the cafs's cigarette girl. When Al makes a big hit with an agent Molly suddenly finds Al  and his money and fame  very attractive. Of course Al is blind to Molly's poisonous ways until it is too late. You have to remember that the whole purpose behind the film is to give you a chance to see and hear the world's greatest entertainer Al Jolson singing on screen in his prime. In this film you get that in bigger doses than you got in The Jazz Singer. So if you are a Jolson fan you are in for a big treat. However be warned this film is what was known in 1928 and 1929 as a goat gland movie. That is it is part silent. The exact ratio is about 75 talking 25 silent. How it is chopped into soundsilent portions is particularly baffling. Some dialogue is sound then will abruptly transition to silent. Warner's had already made an alltalking picture in fact they made the first  1928's The Lights of New York. That film was supposed to be a two reel short that grew to six reels when Jack Warner was out of town but it was a huge hit and sent the march towards talking pictures into overdrive. With the technical challenges of making an alltalking picture behind them you would have thought Warner Bros. would have made Jolson's second talking picture an extra special effort and given it the alltalking treatment too. They didn't but it was still a huge success. In conclusion if you are a Jolson fan and you are interested in the early sound era of motion pictures you'll love this film.".

That film was supposed to be a two reel short that grew to six reels when Jack Warner was out of town but it was a huge hit and sent the march towards talking pictures into overdrive. With the technical challenges of making an alltalking picture behind them you would have thought Warner Bros. would have made Jolson's second talking picture an extra special effort and given it the alltalking treatment too. They didn't but it was still a huge success. In conclusion if you are a Jolson fan and you are interested in the early sound era of motion pictures you'll love this film.";

Two new songs were written for him and became identified with him There's A Rainbow Round My Shoulder which to me fits his style perfectly and is the best thing in the film. The other is Sonny Boy.In the film The Best Things In Life Are Free there is a scene where Jolson played by impersonator Herbert Brooks calls Gordon MacRae Ernest Borgnine and Dan Dailey who play the songwriting team of DeSylva Brown and Henderson and asks them to write a maudlin sentimental ballad he has to sing to a child. They sit down and write one to those specifications and the three of them as well as Jolson are shocked it becomes a hit. Goldman's book says there's reason to believe the story is true.For nearly the entire film Jolson plays it without blackface. Then the finale with him singing Sonny Boy again he dons the minstrel cork to me for no apparent reason. It will forever be a mystery to me why Jolson continued to use the blackface long after he didn't need to.Fans of Al Jolson should see The Singing Fool and folks who want to know about his performing art should see it as well.

It is famous for a dozen reasons... all of which you can read on the other posts which explain them in detail. I waded through THE SINGING FOOL for several reason of my own I wanted to see such a successful film from 1928 the fantastic deco atmosphere of genuine flapper 20s in the nightclub scenes the idea this film is part talkie and part silent is quite fascinating and is a terrific example of emerging technology of the time. The clothes furnishings and art direction are easily enough to keep you watching. The music score does not quite fit in some parts but is a valiant attempt to fully orchestrate the entire film and lay a voice track on top. Jolson looks remarkably like Steve Martin in some scenes and perhaps this notion could work in a Jolson bio today. At times I thought I was watching an alternate version of DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR PLAID. The look and style of the deco 20s as modern film making and with talking acting scenes makes it a fascinating mix. The child who plays Sonny Boy Davy Lee is remarkable for a 4 year old kid very natural and quite emotional. Jolson's oftenscary possessed acting style is mostly pantomime maudlin or simpleton overexpressive but I attribute that to the silent era acting zapped with electrical wiring. A TITANIC level grosser of its day THE SINGING FOOL was the most successful film of all time up until 1939 so make sure read the other comments. All quite fascinating.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite being a superpopular and historic film Al Jolson's picture The Jazz Singer is a rather tedious movie when you see it today. Despite its reputation as 'the first talking picture' very little of it actually is this way. The songs are on the soundtrack and SOME of the dialog but it's essentially a silent movie with a tiresome plot...along with some sound. Here with his follow up picture The Singing Fool the same sort of style of film is here essentially a silent with added dialog and music but the overall plot is a bit better...no a lot better. Now folks watching it today probably won't be very interested but for its day this was a dandy little film.When the film begins Al is a jovial waiter who occasionally performs in a night club. He's smitten with Molly though she clearly does NOT reciprocate. However when he writes a hit song and strikes it big suddenly Molly is interested and marries Al. They have a young son who Al adores and life seems great to Al. However Molly is an evil tramp and soon bores with married life. So she runs off with a new guytaking the baby in tow and leaving Al unable to function. What's next in this soapy film? Watch it and see.There's a lot to love and a lot that is incredibly dated in this one. The songs might just be the best thing about this film as I found myself singing along with Jolson's Sittin on Top of the World and a few other tunes. As for the tender scenes between father and son they are a mixed bag. They were tender and enjoyable...to a point. Unfortunately they often went overboard into a sickly schmaltzy direction. Jolson certainly did NOT believe in subtlety in these portions of the film! Additionally like in The Jazz Singer hold onto your seat as the finale includes Jolson in blackfacea common and beloved tradition that would horrify viewers today. Oddly despite this the film ALSO has the first or one of the first black actors in a talking picture and the guy is NOT some racist stereotype or buffoon.Overall despite the film having many shortcomings it is STILL quite enjoyable and holds up wellmuch better than many old talkies. Mostly of interest to film historians and weirdos like me it's still worth a look for everyone else.".

Jolson's real life persona is as far removed from his character here his legendary ego still talked about to this day.

The story is a switch on typical mother love with Jolson's live for son Danny Lee even greater than the mother's.Mostly sound this has a lot if Jolson singing and other than Judy Garland or Barbra Streisand I can't think of any other singer who really feels the lyrics and brings the audience into their heart. The pathos of some of the plot developments may seem maudlin and manipulated by today's standards but I was touched throughout. Jolson gets a truly hysterical entrance eyeing the camera as if he is making live to it.

Jolson's cinema career was already peaking  while he created a sensation with The Jazz Singer for some reason Warners failed to capitalize on their success and The Singing Fool was released over a year later. Jolson alsohad to share his popularity this time with his own discovery a little cutiecalled Davey Lee and for a short while audiences made him the biggestsensation since Jackie Coogan. When Jolson sang Sonny Boy as hecradled the little boy in his arms audiences were entranced but Lee was only three and a half and after only a few more films his parents withdrew him from the Hollywood glare to lead a normal life.A captivating start as the camera pans around the floor of the speakeasy looking for Blackie Joe you see the hustle bustle chorus girls etc andmeet Al Stone Jolson a waiter by profession a singing fool by nature. It's the old story Al loves gold digger Molly Josephine Dunn who says she will only speak to waiters if they're serving her meanwhile sweet Grace Betty Bronson a cigarette girl worships the ground Al walks on buthe doesn't know she's alive!! Al puts over a ballad It All Depends On You big time and the producers that Molly is toadying up to are impressed enough to think he deserves his own Broadway show!! and suddenly Al looks very appealing to Molly!!And the songs keep coming  I'm Sitting On Top of the World There's a Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder and Golden Gate. Molly's career is also on the rise thanks to Al's nifty song writing ability  she is the toast ofBroadway!! But she has found a new Romeo Reed Howes and in a dramatic scene she deserts Al taking his beloved Sonny Boy with her. Jolson has allowed the audience to build up a rapport with the beautiful little boy his Sonny Boy will melt the coldest heart.Funny enough when Jolson hits the skids the film's pace picks up and lo and behold when he is taken back by Blackie Arthur Housemansuprisingly not playing a drunk here there is Grace after three years nowpromoted to the concession stand but still carrying a torch for Al. Al startsto turn his life around performing again but tragedy strikes.........The last scene has Jolson in blackface being encouraged by a backstage Grace to sing it for Sonny Boy. As the camera zooms in on Jolson you cannothelp but be moved by the powerful talent of the man!!The movie which now seems over long and overly sentimental made a massive 5.9 million world wide. Cinemas were being wired for sound and The Singing Fool became the premiere sound attraction and even theatresthat couldn't afford sound equipment booked the movie and ran Jolson recordings at the appropriate times in the movie. Josephine Dunn justsparkled and you could see why the movie Al worshipped the ground she walked on but I don't know whether it was a case of fansnot really forgiving that not only did she two time Al but she was pretty uncaring about Sonny as well  her career just didn't recover!! Betty Bronsonfared worse she was second billed after Jolson but after a scene at the startto establish her sympathetic true blue character she didn't appear againuntil the end. The fact that her voice apparently didn't record above a whisper may have prompted a rewrite and may have been a reason that she like Dunn didn't have a talkie career!!".

A young tenente lieutenant leading a platoon of chilean soldiers In the Atacama desert against a perubian  bolvian foe in the 1860's. Doing house to house searches fouraging for food and water having a few firefights with local milicia. Some soldiers voicing doubts about their mission some retain a patriotic stance. Various characters from very different walks of life  well portrait. The acting was superb. The movie ends with a dramatic climax and a futile patriotic message somehow fatalistic .

At 44 the exOlympian one of Hollywood's most active 'party animals' was long past the slim athleticism of his youth and looked tired although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS.Not only had Weissmuller gotten too old for his role Johnny Sheffield the quintessential 'Boy' had grown to manhood he was a strapping 17year old so he was written out of the script under the pretext of being 'away at school'. Brenda Joyce at 35 was appearing in her fourth of five films as 'Jane' she would provide the transition when Lex Barker became the new Tarzan in 1949's TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever.Produced by Sol Lesser at RKO on a minuscule budget the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in Mexico. While the location gave a decidedly Hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest Africa veteran director Robert Florey utilized the country extensively incorporating cliff diving and an Aztec temple into the story.When a young island girl Tyrone Power's future bride Linda Christian is rescued in a jungle river by Tarzan he learns that a local high priest George Zucco one of filmdom's most enduring villains had virtually enslaved the local population threatening retribution from a living 'God' if they don't do his bidding. The girl had been chosen to become the 'God's' bride so she fled. Faster than you can say 'Is this a dumb plot or WHAT?' the girl is kidnapped by the priest's henchmen and returned to the island and Tarzan followed by Jane colorful Spanish character 'Benjy' charmingly played by John Laurenz who sings several tunes and a government commissioner are off to take on the Deity and his priest poor Cheeta is left behind. After a series of discoveries the 'God' is simply a con man in an Aztec mask working with the priest in milking the island's rich pearl beds a bit of brawling action and comic relief and songs by Benjy everything reaches the expected happy conclusion.Remarkably TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS features a musical score by the brilliant film composer Dimitri Tiomkin and is far better than what you'd expect from this 'B' movie! While the film would provide a lessthanauspicious end to Weissmuller's time in Tarzan's loincloth he would immediately go on to play Jungle Jim a more eloquent variation of the Ape Man in khakis the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been.Tarzan was about to get a make over and become much sexier...".

	schema:reviewBody "TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS RKO Radio 1948 directed by Robert Florey stars Johnny Weissmuller in what became his 12th and final performance as the Lord of the Jungle and sixth under Sol Lesser's production for RKO. While this long running adventure series could have ended here the Edgar Rice Burroughs character having been on the screen since the silent movie days beginning with Elmo Lincoln in 1918 would go on vine swinging across the theater screen for another two decades with numerous and younger actors assuming the part with Weissmuller on record as being the one most associated with the role not because he was the best or was he? but appearing in more Tarzan adventures and longer than any other actor.As for the story starting with a narration followed by ten minute character introductions Mara Linda Christian a beautiful maiden from the forbidden island is forced by the High Priest George Zucco to become an unwilling bride of a feared island God Varga Fernando Wagner a villainous pearl trader although she actually loves the exiled Tiko Gustavo Bojo. Mara escapes Aquantinia and swims to the location of Tarzan Johnny Weissmiller and Jane Brenda Joyce who agree to assist her. After Mara is found she is abducted and taken back to her island. Tarzan and Jane follow are held prisoners. Following their escape Tarzan intends to unmask the false god and expose the white men after their priceless pearls before Mara's wedding is to take place. Also featured in the cast are Edward Ashley Baluand Andrea Palmer Luana.In spite the fact that TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS might have made Weissmuller's farewell performance into something special its ordinary 68 minute storyline which appears to have been revamped many times over the years especially from the Maria Montez and Jon Hall South Seas adventures produced over at Universal through most of the 1940s weakness dominates few of its strengths. Obvious changes were also being made at this time. Missing from the cast of regulars is Johnny Sheffield as Boy who had outgrown his part. He is mentioned by Jane as she writes a letter to him to be attending school in England a truant officer must have come for him after all these years in the jungle leaving Tarzan and Jane with Cheetah to fill in the void. Along with the good and the not so good this marks the first in the series since the early MGM days to be lensed on location rather than a closed set. Opening titles credit this with location scenes filmed in Acapulco and the studios at Churubusco and Mexico City which is all well and good but one would wonder why color photography wasn't an added factor to the expense of location scenes. Interestingly the use of the footage lacks the substance of any indication of this being in Tarzan's native homeland of Africa. As for the featured players George Zucco as the villainous high priest is the only asset. One only wishes he had more scenes matching wits with Tarzan adding more interest to the story.While the weakest in the series TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS shouldn't be classified as the worst. Lacking more action than usual one of its main faults is not so much as adding new characters to the story but the extensive use of a singing mailman played by John Lorenz as Benji no not in the form of the famous dog. Not truly categorized as a musical it consists of numerous songs to make it so including such forgettable tunes as I'm Taking a Letter to My Friend Tarzan Oh Most Beautiful Mermaid Fairwell Fair Mermaid Let Us Hasten to Adventure and I'll Serenade You With My Guitar. A pity Tarzan doesn't get his chance to serenade Jane in a canoe surrounded by swimming native girls which might have worked as a very silly highlight but for what it is TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS is so offbeat from its predecessors lacking the standard use of animal stampedes dangers setting place underwater though there's a memorable cliff diving scene and added attraction of Tarzan fighting an octopus the traditional Tarzan ape call along with additional footage centered upon other actors bearing little or no interest to the viewer of course with the exception of the characteristic Zucco.Having played on commercial television since the 1960s as part of its Tarzan lineup with the RKO Radio series never placed on video but onto DVD TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS was along with the other Tarzan adventures presented on American Movie Classics cable channel 19982000 before moving to Turner Classic MoviesTCM premiere June 25 2011. As specified TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS marked the end of an era for Weissmuller who no longer was physically fit to appear in any more installments. Considering his typecasting he didn't end up collecting his unemployment check. Almost immediately he found renewed success assuming the part as another jungle hero fully clothed in a brand new film series as JUNGLE JIM 1948 to 1955 for Columbia Pictures. Brenda Joyce would play Jane one more time for the next installment TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN 1949 introducing Lex Barker as the new and younger jungle man. 12".

The difficult underwater scenes are done very well particularly the scene in which Tarzan battles his many youthful enemies with great swimming skill and craft he appears agile strong and a champion in the water that he was. He does quite a bit of rigorous cliff climbing like a mountain lion looking very fit and lionlike and diving into the water here again he appears strong and agile.The grand finale in which he hurled the impostor Balu from a high cliff is quite impressive. When his adversaries invaded his estate he defended his house and home like a true jungle lord throwing some over his head and punching others away as if the were toys! I appreciate Weissmuller's self confidence in asking for a raise for the continuation of the Tarzan contract which was terminated with the lame excuse that he was out of shape. More than a dozen or so Jungle Jim adventure films in which Weismuller now fully clothed did a bit of vine swinging a lot of swimmingdiving and fought lionsleopards and tigers showed that Weissmuller could get back into shape again and was fit and strong enough to carry on for a few more years as the one and only Tarzan if only he was given a fair chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "The filmmakers behind Tarzan and the Mermaids seem to have been more interested in making a travelbeach movie than another traditional Tarzan picture. There just isn't as much action this time around. There's some wonderful swimming in this one though. Tarzan makes a spectacular dive off a very high cliff. Brenda Joyce and Weissmuller are very charming. George Zucco makes a great villain. The God that Tarzan must confront can be rather creepy. The film's soundtrack is certainly elaborate. The scenery is very nice. Cheetah delivers some fun gags. There's a giant octopus too! All of these keep things moving along but it's still pretty mellow for a Weissmuller Tarzan movie.

	onyx:emotionText "The filmmakers behind Tarzan and the Mermaids seem to have been more interested in making a travelbeach movie than another traditional Tarzan picture. There just isn't as much action this time around. There's some wonderful swimming in this one though. Tarzan makes a spectacular dive off a very high cliff. Brenda Joyce and Weissmuller are very charming. George Zucco makes a great villain. The God that Tarzan must confront can be rather creepy. The film's soundtrack is certainly elaborate. The scenery is very nice. Cheetah delivers some fun gags. There's a giant octopus too! All of these keep things moving along but it's still pretty mellow for a Weissmuller Tarzan movie. The movie even has several songs in it! I think they should have called this one Tarzan Takes A Vacation. It's different but certainly not bad.

In this film he's found himself a culture who worships the God Baloo. Baloo in fact is a pearl trader Fernando Wagner who puts on a Baloo suit and with high priest George Zucco keeps the natives in line. Wagner wants pearls but Zucco's got an eye for Linda Christian and Baloo says to her to marry with Zucco. But she likes Gustavo Rojo and in the end Tarzan has to straighten everyone out in his usual manner.Brenda Joyce was Jane again but Johnny Sheffield as Boy had departed the series going off to England for a neglected education. God only knows what that was like for the kid in an English public school. But Sheffield at least managed to miss some of the nonsense rampant in Tarzan And The Mermaids.Don't get me wrong it's great fun if you don't take it seriously.".

I'm used to seeing more of that in these movies.I haven't seen every single one of the films but it looks like there are certainly things going on. I was thinking that they'd make it so that the fake god turned out to be real after all. I'm actually glad they didn't. It was also nice to not actually see mermaids in the movie. Instead we just get people who act like them. Still that is a pretty misleading title. What is it with these movies and doing that? There were some nice peaceful bits in it that were pleasant enough.

Although it may have cost less for filming abroad it looks more expensive than any other RKO film in the series taking advantage of Acapulco beaches and real pyramids as Aquatania and with impressive dcors for all the scenes related to the temple of god Balu especially the exterior built on steep rocks. Kurt Neumann should have stayed as director instead of Robert Florey who gives it a very slow pace. Neumann had done a fine work with Tarzan and the Amazons Tarzan and the Leopard Woman and Tarzan and the Huntress and finished his career directing the classic The Fly the year before his death while Florey became a television director after a career of few remarkable films. If Weissmuller looks tired the chimp playing Cheeta is not as good as the others but the worst character is Benji an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs that have a Caribbean air in a location supposed to be Africa and shot in Mxico! Boring and decidedly of dubious taste it was a sad farewell to Weissmuller's Tarzan.".

Admittedly a bit of wellstaged action helped to distract from the plot's shortcomings.

The only brightspots are the snippets of RobertFloreydoesRobertFlaherty fauxdocumentary footage some decent underwater photography a bit where loads of stuntmen leap off a cliff and the unexpected octopus duel it won't be unexpected anymore sorry. The remaining 61 of the 64 minutes consist of Tarzan swimming and people getting into and out of boats calling to mind that famous review of They Were Expendable alas the similarities end there as well as those bloody songs. Even Johnny Sheffield and the decent Cheetas had buggered off by this time. RKO's revival of the popular MGM series ultimately created one minor classic of its kind Desert Mystery two enjoyable timewasters Triumphs and Huntress a pair of iffy cheesy romps and this dud.";

However and I am not sure why Weissmuller and 'Boy' Johnny Sheffield jumped from this prestige studio to the less than stellar RKOwhere the budgets shrank considerably as did the quality. The scripts got a lot more weird and the films became chock full of poorly integrated stock footage and animals that often weren't even African. Additionally 'Jane' Maureen O'Sullivan remained at MGM and a new leading lady needed to be found. After having the character be 'off on vacation in England' or 'helping with the war effort' in a couple films RKO decided to recast this character with Brenda Joycewho bore little similarity to O'Sullivan.This episode was shot in Mexicowhich might explain why the extras look a lot more Hispanic than African! And to make it even more obvious that this is taking place no where near the Dark Continent you see stock footage of Canadian Geese and the baddies hang out in an Aztec pyramid!!! Why didn't they also have some Moon Men or the Brooklyn Dodgers in the film while they were at it?! The film begins with a woman running off from the land of Aquatania. Why? Because the priest George Zucco wants her to marry her people's god Balu not the bear. She knows he is NOT Balu but some guy in a costume but her people have been fooled. And when she escapes she naturally runs into Tarzan and Jane who try to help. In the end all three end up back in Aquatania for a showdown with the baddies.While absolutely none of this bizarre film makes any sense I think the writers were experimenting with LSD it is reasonably entertainingin a dumb way. I enjoyed seeing the very paunchy Weismuller as Tarzannot that he was great but seeing an older guy playing this hero gave me a bit of a laugh. This film is a great one actually for bad movie buffs as it is clearly one of the worst of the Weismuller filmswhich is a shame as the earlier MGM ones were surprisingly good.By the way the Cheeta in the film is much younger and smaller than the one in the last film. This new one was cuter but just didn't have the same screen presence and grace as the old Cheeta!".

This time out he and Jane Brenda Joyce are enjoying life without Boy who is in England studying. This time out Tarzan must save a woman Linda Christian who is being offered up to a man George Zucco pretending to be the God of Aquantania but our Ape Man friend knows he's just a fake and plans on saving the girl and showing the people the truth. RKO decided to shoot this Tarzan in Mexico City and it really shows because the locals are obviously not from Africa and none of the footage looks anything like a jungle. Most of the time it looks as if you're visiting a resort because the water is clear the skies blue and there's not a single shot of what appears to be anything resembling a jungle. Who knows perhaps RKO was rewarding their stars by allowing them to shoot in such a pretty location. I do somewhat doubt this because if they were too cheap to hire someone to write a story it's doubtful they were going to do anything useful for the cast. This entire film is so incredibly bad that one can't help but wonder if the screenwriters and director Florey were experimenting with some grass or some extremely harmful alcohol. The story is all over the place and it never makes a bit of sense as characters and their motivations seen to change every few minutes. The screenwriters and production crew couldn't even seem to deliver what the title promises because there's not a single mermaid to be seen and the only time the word is used is by a supporting player who throws the word out when Tarzan catches a normal woman at sea. This one word of dialogue seems to have been shot apart from the rest of the movie and just thrown in and I'm guessing it was thrown in after the producers realized that they wasn't a mermaid in the film. Weissmuller clearly packing on the pounds by this point sleepwalks through the film as does Joyce who is really wasted. The two of them don't seem interested in anything going on and have zero chemistry together. Zucco was a master at B films but sadly he doesn't add anything either as his dialogue will put you to sleep and his character just isn't very interesting. Christian isn't too bad in her part but the screenplay doesn't give her much to do. TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS would mark the final film in the series and sadly it's the worst of the bunch. I guess this is to be expected because the previous two entries were rather poor and it's clear that everyone involved had given up all hopes for the series.".

Given that the running time just tips the 60 minute mark there is substantial amount of padding on show which never bodes well from the long narrated intro which also gives the villains' game away from the off the various aqua pursuits of the island folk although the cliff diving is thrilling it must be said and then the exploits of Benji. If Benji's fulllength songs don't eat up enough screen time then there is Benji preparing for and then engaging in a sea joust. Of the songs it's interesting to note the pained but humouring faces of Jane et al when Benji treats them to his ditties  a bit like visitors enduring a friend's insistence that they sit through their 'talented' child's piano recital and who act all polite when all they really want to do is scream ENOUGH!. Anyway Cheetah has the right idea and nicks Benji's guitar early on but sadly he is ordered by Tarzan to return it.Oh and Benji is supposed to be a river postman but he can't even get that right and forgets the only letter that he has to deliver to Tarzan Towers. Luckily he has no qualms about invading privacy and having read it previously conveys in the form of verse cue five more minutes of Benji action its contents from a now Englandbased Boy. Although given the sketchy information Benji communicates Boy is clearly living student life to the max and not missing the jungle one bit.Anyway aside from no mermaids we get the lovely Linda Christian as Mara a crook pretending to be a God who wants to marry Mara which would rathar give the nonGod game away on the wedding night I'd have thought George Zucco walking around an Aztec pyramid a lot with some cool starshaped shell necklace bling and a secret island that curiously leads directly to Tarzan and Jane's gaff by river and only takes 10 minutes to get there by canoe as Tiko Mara's true love also demonstrates when he randomly shows up at TarzanJane's treetop manor.

The charm of the early movies is lost as a tired plot limps towards the inevitably rushed and predictable finale. The setting is at odds with earlier movies being filmed quite obviously from the extra's alone in Mexico. The plot is terribly weak and Brenda Joyce lacks any of the charm of Maureen O'Sullivan who was such an integral part of the success of the early Tarzan films. There is also a lack of any jungle animals those being replaced by an octopus. Even for the time this really is a poor effort it's as if they had all just given up. Only a few impressive diving scenes and it's historical value make this film worth watching. Even for the most ardent Tarzan fan this is desperately disappointing fare.".

Paris Underground is a film she produced herself in England and it's very good. It's the story of the American wife Kitty de Mornay Bennett of a Frenchman George Rigaud who is swept into the Resistance when she's asked to help get an English flier back to London. The work excites and intrigues her so much she decides not to leave France and instead continues helping fliers escape. She is assisted in this by a nervous friend Gracie Fields.I found this a suspenseful and interesting film and although it wasn't shot in France some of the sets like the baker's were quite good. The performances are excellent. Rigaud as Kitty's husband is suave and likable Kurt Krueger is excellent as a German officer who takes an interest in Kitty and Gracie Fields in her last role though she lived until 1979 is wonderful as Kitty's friend.This is a little known gem and I thought it was well done.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paris Underground aka Madame Pimpernell is a solid British entry in the warintrigue genre produced immediately after cessation of hostilities with Germany in 1945 by aging but still glamorous American star Constance Bennett and distributed in the United States by United Artists. Ms. Bennett a somewhat flighty American married to a French foreign office official and her middleage spinster pal Gracie Fields while fleeing the city during the fall of Paris in 1940 find themselves by happenstance carrying a downed British aviator in the trunk of their automobile. Turned back to Paris by a German road bock they have to take the flier back to hiding in Gracie's apartment. One of the best and most suspenseful scenes occurs when the girls have a flat with the pilot in the car's rear and a Nazi officer stops to assist them! By hook and crook they eventually manage to smuggle the young aviator to Free France. Delighted with their success they establish and underground railroad that eventually gets hundreds of allied airmen back to their bases. With a combination of American audacity and British pluck these two brave and resourceful women cause the occupying Germans a big headache. Sharply directed by Gregory Ratoff and atmospherically photographed by Lee Garmes Paris Underground is tense exciting and believable. Acting by the two female leads is first rate with good support coming from Argentine actor George Rigaud as Ms. Bennett's husband Kurt Kreuger as a suave but cruel Gestapo captain who would like to be more than friends with the ripely beautiful Ms. Bennett and Eily Malyon as the grouchy concierge of Ms. Field's hotel. Editing is a little untidy in places with some scenes taking too long to unfold. However the story is never draggy but engaging and exciting from beginning to end. Alexander Tansman's florid but stirring score which drew an Academey Award nomination drives the action along at a gallop.This picture bears some resemblance to glitzier Joan Crawford vehicle Reunion In France 1942. While not up to competing headup with that big hitter in the entertainment department the more staid Paris Underground is somehow more believable and is an enjoyable inspiring little potboiler in its own right for fans of the warintrigue thriller.".

Constance Bennett plays the lead and over the years she tended to play a variety of rich society ladies. Costarring is Gracie Fields a British music hall singer and comedienne. It's a strange pairing but it worked..particularly since they deglamorized Bennett for the part.The story begins just as France is falling to the Nazis in 1940. An American woman Bennett and her companion Fields are trapped in Paris. They also accidentally come upon a pilot of a downed British plane...and through this help to create an underground organization which repatriates pilots through the course of the war. Naturally the Germans are more than a bit anxious to catch them. The film's biggest strength might just be because it came out when it did. Instead of snarly overthetop Nazis the Germans in this one are more believable than ones you would have seen in films just a short time earlier. Plus a restrained performance by Bennett one of her better ones actually help to make this an enjoyable and well made film.".

Unfortunately the film doesn't represent reality well in the conclusion which goes for the traditional Hollywood happy ending rather than what probably would have happened in a real life situation.Made towards the end of the war this pretty much seems to have lost its impact simply out of a been there done that sort of feeling. Of course there's the typical propaganda and a few moments of grave tension which are handgripping moments of true fear. Ms. Bennett was the film's producer which gives a good indication of why in her 40's she looks totally glamorous throughout.

As the end approaches there is a little surprise but it's all fixed up within minutes as victory is snatched from the jaws of defeat and medals are pinned on the heroines. Hohum. I barely kept myself from turning off the television.Outdoor scenes are all shot in studio and look very fake. The foggy night scene in the fieldspuleeze! The music has moments when it goes over the top.Although the movie is set in France French characters are insignificant while the American and English ladies are large ultimately heroic presences. It's certainly a narrow nationalistic vision of Paris underground. I did find it refreshing to see a movie especially one focused on the conflicts of war in which the lead characters are female.Don't get excited about seeing this. Don't set aside important time for it. But if you run into it accidentally you probably won't think it's a total waste of time.I believe this film was also released with the title Madame Pimpernel.".

You want to feel for him because he is a victim yet at the same time he seems to be hard and you sort of have to ask yourself...maybe he IS the killer?  That doesn't last long because we find out it can't be him...he may be a user but he's not a killer.  I loved the woman who played Lita very sexy in an unconventional way and I'd like to see her in more films.  I thought a lot of the story was flawed when it came to reason but it didn't hinder it much overall. Entertaining thriller good acting I'd recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I know everyone considering watching this movie thinks the same thing...it's probably going to suck but there's nothing else on or you watch it for Swayze in his post 80's straight to video film career. Either way you look at it this is actually a pretty entertaining film if you can suspend any rational thoughts for about 90 minutes.The first hour of this film is the best. We see Swayze wrongfully put in prison on death row and about to be executed within a few weeks. He has written a best selling novel in prison and has acquired 4 very lonely fans that he communicates with via cassette tapes. The problem is he leads every one of them to believe that they are the only ones keeping him alive so when two of the tapes get switched one of them sends him a death threat out of pure jealousy. After about 15 min into the film his eviction is overturned and he is released from jail with the ubiquitous fear of a killer stalking him. He then visits each one of the girls to find out who is sending him the threats.Honestly I liked the plot of this movie. Not an original theme with the jealous psycho slasher but it is an original storyline nonetheless. Swayze does act kind of stupid in some scenes and unconvincing in others when he is released from jail we all know he had the first death threat but come on to show NO HAPPINESS at all for escaping death row and having your name cleared?? Bad acting Patrick but overall it is a good movie. It does kind of wander in the middle and becomes a routine slasher where most of the killings are done off screen but it does serve as a fairly capable whodunnit. Oh and there is a pretty lame 'buddy' part in the middle which you can basically ignore.I was able to guess who the killer was before the first murder but honestly they played it out so it could be anyone also one character is written as a little too conveniently psycho to allow anyone to possibly get any clues as to who did it. I thought the best part though was the fact that only 2 of the 4 tapes were switched in the beginning so we can surmise of course that 2 of them found out about the other girls and we have to guess which 2 they were though one is very obvious complete with broken picture frame of Swayze during the montage of him calling all of them. The ending shot is pretty cheesy but hey what do you expect? Overall an entertaining movie. Not thought provoking but worth a look. 710 stars.".

Race Darnell played by Patrick Swayze on Death Row for killing his wife exchanges letters in the form of casette recordings with four women each of them thinking she is his sole support. But one of them discovers the truth and turns nasty. Soon after his conviction is reversed he gets out and meets up with the women one by one trying to find out who's threatening him. But before he identifies her she starts killing the others using the same method he was supposed to have used with his wife.From then on the film becomes more implausible and more gory. Also though tension is first built up with Swayze going on the run it's then reduced by cutting away from the action to show the Feds having discussions about who the killer is instead of them simply pursuing Race implacably. A nice touch  or a digression depending on your point of view  is a buddybuddy friendship between Race and one of his former wardens Horton Roger E Mosley who's a fan of cowboy stories. You're kept guessing until the last few minutes though mainly because one of the characters acts irrationally and the Feds climb some stairs very slowly! All in all it's worth a look on TV or as a bargain rental.".

All in all a rather good film well Directed and well shot though nothing arty or unusual on location in some varied places. The plot carries this film as well as the performance of Swayze I enjoyed seeing him riding a horse and dancing albeit just a bit again in this  I'm a great admirer of his work and this is a not so well known but noteworthy example of his acting talent.Note Katy Selverstone FBI woman bears a striking resemblance to Jodie Foster don't you think?".

Just before being released two of his tapes are switched causing him death threats.Swayze seems to have lost his macho swagger for this movie at least. He comes across as a victim not the hero he usually plays. One of the women he toyed with on tape is Gia Carides. She is lovely and I would personally like to see more of her. I'm sorry I haven't noticed her until now. She probably has the best acted role in the movie. Roger E.

He is shocked to discover that some of the tapes were mixed up when he posted them and that one of the women send him back a tape threatening his life.  All this is academic until Swayze is released from Jail and his name cleared. He now travels round America trying to find out who sent the letter.This is a promising start to the film. Soon after this however the movie lurches off the road of drama and becomes melodrama. The interesting implications of Swazye's relationships are sidelined in favour of action sequences and implausible plot twists and the direction becomes plodding and predictable. See it for Swayses' performance and the first 30 minutes then see if you can guess the killer's identity. There are no tricks in this film the director trys to keep you guessing but as the plot is formulaic all the way there's never any doubt in the end who will win and who will lose.".

Anyone who thinks this is just a coincidence is pretty naive. Nonetheless the facts support the film's stark brutal portrayal of Communist China's leadership. At the very least it shows a regime unwilling to hear both sides of a story.

It keeps your attention throughout although I thought the ending was a bit confusing because things happened almost too fast for the viewer to take in.

	schema:reviewBody "Not well received back in 1997 this film deserved a much kinder evaluation and in light of present geopolitical and commercial developments even appears to have been prophetic. But of course hindsight's always easy and since most people who reviewed Red Corner eight years ago never lived in mainland China it was likewise not highly probable they would see it through the same jaded seasoned eyes. And in fact it helps to be experienced in China living when watching Red Corner for much of its deeper mannerisms only become apparent if you know how and when to look for them.For example Richard Gere as subtle and lowkey as usual portrays Jack Moore a USbased business person willing to forego ideals and politics in order to enter the much vaunted mainland market hyped up to be the best thing since instant noodles when in fact like everything in life it too comes at a price. When time arrives to sign a large media contract Moore wants to pause and assess particulars by the book. He also notices China's newlyfound penchant for blunt nationalism oops patriotism done nicely by a scene where he gauges clubgoers' vehement reactions to a coaxing DJ and doesn't quite feel good about his local contacts including excellent veteran James Hong. But as a simple mortal Moore joins a gorgeous catwalking model Jessey Meng at his hotel room for a night of brief pleasures. Brief because the next morning begins with him dragged away by Beijing cops who having found the girl's dead body in the room and her fresh blood all over him proceed to assume the American guilty.Now Red Corner's not a racist film. It doesn't fall into obvious stereotypes nor does it contain any racial slurs or profanity at all. Asians aren't made to be villains just as the uncaring US embassy staff do not in any way represent the Western contingent. Having said that the movie doesn't shy away from painful issues. It clearly conveys xenophobic attitudes found among mainland people and authorities as many who've lived there can attest to. Of course not everyone's like that and competent actress Bai Ling The Crow Anna and the King does well as Moore's honest crusading defense attorney Shen Yuelin during what quickly devolves into a kangaroo court. Meanwhile Red Corner shows the abusive treatment our protagonist's subjected to often to the point of endangering his life. When asked Shen Yuelin's assistant says that Moore's frequent beatings are simply because he's a foreigner a familiar sentiment to nonChinese residents of the mainland. Similarly the Americans involved in this legal fiasco wish to distance themselves from aiding Moore as doing so might work against commercial interests based on sheer greed. Thus Red Corner preceded its time by faithfully showing how global factions are willing to play along just to get that great juicy carrot dangling from a stick most don't want to acknowledge. As of 2005 companies like Microsoft and HP openly pursue a policy of appeasement when it comes to China willingly accepting political strings attached to what are supposed to be mere commercial activities.And if you don't consider all that a sign of the film's credibility how about the fact that mainland authorities quickly moved to ban it and prevent its cast and crew from entering China? Just for its attempt to challenge an authoritarian mindset and stand for free expression alone should Red Corner be applauded. Additionally it's a mostly believable project from start to finish accurately sampling many of China's social staples through concepts such as guanxi connections and da ge basically a nickname for somebody more respected than oneself yet doesn't make any claims of exotica while steering clear of clichs save for Yuelin living with her kindly old grandmother. There's one scene showing Yuelin speaking to a police official in English so as to avoid making him lose face which is utter nonsense of course probably the actor doesn't speak Chinese. Moore himself speaks just a bit Putonghua standard Chinese as do many of the business people and newlyarrived in mainland China. Again familiar from real life as was the interaction between him and the locals. Beyond that for something made almost entirely in California Red Corner passes for Beijing with very few glitches vehicles sometimes don't look authentic featuring ample attention to detail and an atmosphere faithful to the original. Certainly some footage was covertly shot in Beijing itself yet due to the government's disapproving attitude production had to relocate back to the States. All in all Red Corner also plays it fair going to show that China does have judicial systems with a potential to work as well as any others. It makes a point of addressing the mainland's criminal code and court hearing procedures all appear in detail. Plus eventually the truth does come out and while it's pretty obvious who dunnit from the get go this isn't the main point here.The point is a warning against oppression wherever it may be and whatever form it may take and a cautionary note regarding the perils of blind opportunism. Just because somebody promises you a gilded prize for playing by their rules doesn't mean those rules stop applying once the prize is obtained if at all. And if we're not careful there won't be too many reviews of this critical nature in times to come. Relations with China as with any other nation should be equivocal and based on standing for your own values not another's and that means not compromising liberties and freedoms standing at the very core of enlightened progressive society. Like Red Corner's tagline says leniency for those who confess and comply severity for those who dare resist that will be our downfall.Rating    ".

I've met students who lived in China at the time who absolutely refuse to discuss the situation back home that Ling Bai does is testimony to her 'white spirit' and she really does steal the show from Gere here in a kind of reverse Casablanca 'hill of beans' role. Whether the depiction of conditions in the Chinese judicial system is accurate or not the movie does succeed in making the viewer understand that there are two views to almost anything and that in China as anywhere power corrupts. Stacking the deck against consular officials is a nice touch for these people are truly the cowards and turncoats the movie makes them out to be. The plot swerves from the inexplicable to the Orwellian to a love story which does it is true sort of come out of nowhere but the final scene on the tarmac does much to salvage that. Maybe Gere wanted to make the Chinese look bad but they certainly don't need his help. Based on an incident that happened not in China but in Italy Red Corner is viewable without ever coming close to being a great film.

Being a good friend of the Dalai Lama and Tibet in general the the Chinese government and army are all bad people argument is what keeps this film going. It could almost be considered a crash course on what is still going on in China today. Don't get me wrong the film is actually quite well done and has a good story to go with it which makes it more than a two hour CBS special.The whole plot centers around the Gere character being framed for a murder of a Chinese girl. The girl just happens to be the daughter of an important general which makes Gere's chances of survival all the less. Sure all of the cliches are built into this film especially the wrongfully imprisoned man haven't the 90's been a real haven to these kinds of films ever since The Fugitive?. But the plot is still interesting the film throughout and other than a few twists that seemed unnecessary keeps focus until the end. I never will understand why Gere didn't just stay at the embassy he must have been somewhat crazy.The bond between the two main characters starts off very cold and warms until the end with an airport scene that was very fitting. After watching the film you'll know what I mean. The chase scene through the city is very exciting although at times farfetched but still makes for some good action in between a few dramatic scenes. Even without on screen violence ala American History X or Saving Private Ryan this film still manages to invoke fear simply knowing that the Chinese will do whatever they please regardless of human life.This film only helps to show China as an unhumanitary state with archaic laws and traditions. When one is forced to plead guilty in order to have leaniency directed towards them something is really wrong. Hopefully this film will open some eyes to the situation and be a catalyst to future change.710 stars.".

I read some of the quotes that the Chinese actors made who were in this movie they said the movie was being too lenient I tend to believe them.  Just because Richard Gere is a Buddhist doesn't make him biased as some have suggested he is too gifted an actor and too much a gentlemen to let his spiritual beliefs affect a movie his compassion sure but not spiritual beliefs.  Too many people think it's hate but what it is is his compassion.  Just be glad we live in a democracy and have compassion for those who don't.

	schema:headline " Boxer Rebellion in Madison Square Gardens?";
	schema:reviewBody "Essentially what we are shown here is not the classical American court drama. When our 'Mr. Deeds' goes to town the town is Beijing and his case becomes a showtrial in the cockpit of a new Chinese revolution that is taking place between the oldguard Maoists and the modernisers.   Richard Gere's American is an alienated rootless 'Rick' caught in the cultural crossfire between two power blocs. It is his enforced engagement with the reality of another worldview and the struggle of an intelligent Chinese woman to redeem the revolutionary excesses of her culture that lead directly to the Casablancaesque ending where love is sublimated beyond the personal to an ideal understanding and identification  'You have a family here'  with the historical plight of a people.   This explains Richard Gere's unusually selfless performance where he has had the taste and intelligence to let the women particularly his Chinese defence lawyer dominate every situation and every scene. Indeed this feminist tendency in the film is also reflected in the consistently hostile view taken of the militaristic structure of Chinese state power as so much authoritarian posturing. As symbol of a new China the young woman lawyer is most effective The ancient Greeks also saw the spirit of unbiased law as female and Shakespeare's Portia is another such paradigm. And the actress portraying her illuminates the screen with her passionate intellectual intensity.   There is an effective parallelism to the revolutionary acts which destroyed the young lawyer's father during the time of the Cultural Revolution leaving her with crippling and unresolved guilt and the barrel of a gun in the hands of the murdered girl's father which alone can resolve the historical tensions at work in the courtroom and reverse all the political lies in a new revolutionary act additionally realising the great potential of a young China by freeing that stirring Chinese conscience from its historical contradictions.   So this is an intelligent political thriller although those of a more CostasGavrian or Godardian intellectual purity do seem to resent  seeing a crisis of the Left viewed even from a very disengaged American viewpoint disliking the humanist American strain of populist appeal in a political context and resenting the smooth professionalism of the presentation as a mere circus. Even stranger are the objectors to Gere's Buddhism who seemingly take fright at the intrusion of other perspectives into their own blinkered focus! In any case Buddhism seems clearly not to be an issue to the scriptwriter.   This film in no way presents itself as the last word on its subject  but it is an intelligent and engaging movie which far from slandering the Chinese in the manner some vintage KoreanWar tubthumper about the 'Yellow Peril' goes out of its way not to identify the Chinese people with their masters. Curiously this is exactly what the film's detractors do!   There is a sly reference to the Boxer Rebellion that began China's long road to modernisation in the person of the trusty who was sent to beat up or even kill the American but who comes to see that the real foreign devils in this instance are the corrupted Chinese officials who have sold out to the worst foreign traits of cynicism and greed by doing backdoor deals with an unscrupulous Western communications company and who finally confesses his error with true selfless revolutionary earnestness.   The fact that this Boxer Rebellion is played out in the blockbuster film equivalent of Madison Square Gardens and is mightily entertaining throughout has led many critics to assume that all they have been presented with is a superficial entertainment unworthy of such a serious subject. Actually the film is fully engaged with the tragedy and passion of the Chinese people as they try to work out their destiny and the proof of this is that to any unbiased observer the film leaves one with a new respect for the Chinese people caught up in the complexities of their own history and struggling for a better life. There is nothing patronising there is emphatically no United States Cavalry riding to the rescue.    And I should have thought the contempt shown throughout towards official American diplomacy and state policy would have appealed to the most antiAmerican leftist. But are the critics just taking fashionable left jabs at their own rightwing bogies?  and I do mean Humphrey! Let us leave these obsessives to their futile shadowboxing forever engaged with an opponent entirely constructed from the straw which evidently bulks out their own brainpans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Overall this isn't a bad movie. It's a pretty decent courtroom drama  sort of Law  Order Beijing. It's got a lot of suspense and it provides a fascinating glimpse of the inner workings of the Chinese justice system. I offer that last point with the proviso of course that the star of this movie is Richard Gere and Gere is known for having a somewhat antiChinese or more accurately antiPeople's Republic of China outlook. The view of China presented here is an ominous one  and that's not entirely fabricated. I travelled to China a few years ago. I never got in trouble with the law thank goodness! but still when you're walking through Tienanmen Square and a column of Chinese soldiers suddenly comes marching right toward you shouting at you you know that the basic message even though you don't speak Chinese is get out of the way or we'll trample you! So yes even in completely unthreatening circumstances there are vaguely threatening elements to being in China.In this movie Gere plays Jack Moore an American businessman trying to close a deal in China who picks up a girl at a nightclub. She ends up being murdered in his hotel room he's the prime suspect and it's clear that the system has decided he's guilty before he even goes on trial and the court flat out refuses to hear any evidence that supports him and challenges the obviously prearranged verdict. How Moore can triumph over this system is the issue.All that's pretty good. Gere's performance is good. The problem is the one American man takes on the entire People's Republic of China scenario. Yes Moore had a court appointed defence lawyer played by a young U.S. based Chinese actress named Ling Bai who becomes increasingly sympathetic to him and wants to prove his innocence but essentially Moore does it all himself. Even in the courtroom he essentially takes over the case questioning witnesses  even when his lawyer is there. That all was a bit too much and it strained the movie's credibility too far. Still it's an entertaining and suspenseful if perhaps implausible couple of hours.".

I visited all over China and Lhasa Tibet right after the olympics and can vouch that the same legal situation still exists there today. In Beijing we drove by a large concrete and windowless courtbuilding with the CCP emblem seen many times in the film and omnipresent in China in general and when asked what the building was my tour guide just responded plainly That's where you go to die. For a foreigner yeah it might take a murder or espionage charge to keep you imprisoned indefinitely over there but for Chinese citizens many crimes are still punishable by execution without a fair trial just as the film accurately portrays.So if you're into Chinese history or culture then this is definitely worth watching even more than once. If not then don't watch it.".

For a foreigner yeah it might take a murder or espionage charge to keep you imprisoned indefinitely over there but for Chinese citizens many crimes are still punishable by execution without a fair trial just as the film accurately portrays.So if you're into Chinese history or culture then this is definitely worth watching even more than once. If not then don't watch it.";

The story opened my eyes again very wide and showed me how the human rights in other countries as in China aren't respected. I hope that this situation will change very soon!Then I am impressed how many details were integrated in the sceneries to create a real Chinese atmosphere. I saw in a french TV magazine a documentation of the making of RED CORNER.

	schema:reviewBody "Wolfgang Peterson has shown he can direct a suspenseful and kinetic movie with Das Boot a splendid evocation of life inside a crowded steel tube. His work since then has been spotty more commercial than I'd have hoped. This movie is an improvement. I'd expected a thorough condemnation of everything about the People's Republic of China especially given Richard Gere's devotion to Tibet. Yet if this is occasionally clunky and confusing it's still not bad. I found it engaging.The narrative follows Gere who is framed for the murder of a beautiful model in Beijing and by dint of sheer determination on the part of himself whom the court in the person of the grim battle ax behind the bench insists on calling the Accused Moore and on the part of his courtappointed defense counsel Bai Ling who begins as an ordinary uninterested subject with the PRC boot on her neck and gradually warms up to Gere and procedural due process the chemistry between them can best be described as two people. I said it was engaging. One of the reasons it's engaging is the appearance and performance of Bai Ling as Gere's public defender. She is one alluring young lady. Imagine if Audrey Hepburn had been born in China instead of the Netherlands. Yum. She so petite and delicate it seems as if any rough house might break one of her long bones. Since joining the global community China has come up with a string of colorful movies and equally colorful actresses  Gong Li to Bai Ling. Gere gives one of his better performances. He manages to convincingly project terror and that's not his strong suit as an actor. I like Richard Gere though. He was my costar in the unforgettable umm wait it will come to me  YES No Mercy. He had a little trouble with some of his scenes but I helped him out.So basically it's a tale of two stalwarts against the rules of a rigid and ruthless culture in which the best way to avoid execution is to plead guilty to murder. It's not exactly a courtroom drama though nor a prison tale. Gere manages to escape and jump clumsily from one rooftop to another while being chased by meanlooking Chinese cops. I had a feeling that Peterson had left this scene in though only weakly justified for fear the audience might be getting impatient at having to listen to all that Mandarin Chinese much of it with no subtitles. I certainly got impatient listening to Mandarin when I had to take a class in it.The courtroom scenes are especially bewildering because first they didn't make much sense to me and second the climactic scene is so agitated and noisy. Something to do with a general and a package of American television programs with which Gere intended to pollute Sinitic culture. And not even a nod in the direction of General Tso's chicken. Yes disappointing.Still the scene of parting between Gere and Ling at the airport is handled with affection and given a silky texture as of a Chinese robe with the emotional content muted and no kiss in sight. It reminded me of the climax of Casablanca  Where I go you can't follow and so on except here the gender roles are reversed. Overall it's not badly done.".

Quite dramatic and brutal in the first part warm and funny in the second. Full of mad ideas. A prankster movie and at the same time a political statement on the brainwash. Is it comedy? Drama? I don't know. Does it matter? Definitely worth seeing. I also really loved it because it's so different from the standard European arthouse flicks. More fun more diverse crazier. A raw film. Moritz Bleibtreu the male lead seems to be one of Germany's finest. Camera is doc style handheld but never nauseating.".

First of all this is not a comedy it's a drama about the modern television how it manipulates us and our lives.The actors as in DIE FETTEN JAHRE SIND VORBEI are very well casted and do a pretty good job here especially Bleibtreu. The photography is manily realistic and in a documentary style and so is the acting. Some might think that its a bit overdosed showing the TVproducers doing nothing else than sniffing coke and being assholes but those who work in the business will recognize most of it.I really enjoyed watching the movie even if it could have been a bit shorter and to the point. There are not many directors in Germany which are brave enough to write such explosive stuff!".

Anyway in this movie it was well done and if I think about Stipe Erceg in Die fetten Jahre sind vorbei that's also not always the case in Weingartner's movies. Unfortunately the actors had to fight with clich after clich being thrust upon them. The cocainesniffing not giving a damn about anything media guy the socio phobic computer nerd who spends his time with conspiracy theories by the way Weingartner should probably talk with the psychiatric association  he obviously has buried somewhere in his movie a miraculous cure for a psychosis seeing as Philipp is socio phobic and then a couple of weeks later he isn't anymore not really anyway and the revolutionary who is just a hurt little girl inside. Characterisation gets a little better towards the end at least for the main characters. Sadly it's not enough to give them any depth. The directing style was very conservative  the initial characterisation of Rainer the news paper clips or the raid  there's nothing we haven't seen before. It's not badly directed but in connection with the revolutionary content not the content itself being revolutionary  we've all seen movies about the bad bad media biz but the film being about revolution it could have used some more revolutionary directing. As in Die fetten Jahre sind vorbei I'm sorry for the constant comparison between those two movies but they are so similar not only in style but also in content that it just forces itself on me  Weingartner uses lengthy monologues to explain why revolution is goodnecessarythe thing to do which can and does get boring. Fortunately there are some funny scenes although he sometimes tries too hard. The morale of the story is inconsequential at best. Because it obviously is a victory for everybody that people stop watching TV altogether to read books or to go for a walk So bad TV makes people stupid and good TV makes people stop watching TV? Also Rainer stresses more than once that you should trust people to be able to handle intelligent TV. But by manipulating the quota he doesn't even give them a choice. Isn't his approach to forcefeed them the good stuff as bad as forcefeed them the bad stuff?".

Moritz Bleibtreu is the perfect actor for playing the a TV producer Loud eccentric on edge constantly drinking or sniffing a line no respect for other people full of himself. His exit from the studio and his drive in the Jaguar through Berlin to Downset's Anger is memorable. Excellent throughout the movie are also Gregor Blob as Maiwald Rainer's even more polarizing boss what a fabulous name for the character and Milan Peschel for the introvert securityguardcomeconspiracytheorist Philip.Unfortunately the good part of the movie ends after Rainer's accident. This is where the movie tries to be a moralist moviecomedyserious filmblockbuster. Unfortunately it fails on all counts. The constant swing back and forth between the genres made me feel unease half of the time. Weingarten was constantly trying to get a message across to the viewer but I'm afraid he didn't know what it was himself. If he was just trying to provide entertainment why did he constantly attempt touching on my moralist conscience? I hope you get my dilemma.Elsa Sophie Gambard alias Pegah is really pretty but the only face she could make the whole movie was a crossover Angeline Jolie TomraiderI am an evil alienMy life is frustratingI am in love with you. After seeing her on screen with the same face while screaming at Rainer and kissing him a few scenes later I had to laugh out loud.Superfluous are the swimming pool scene  what the heck does that have to do with the movie  and the very superficial love story between Rainer and Pegah. Making the movie end almost exactly like in Die Fetten Jahre Sind Vorbei  didn't help. What? Did Weingarten run out of ideas but was forced by the production company to finish before Christmas? Comeon! I did enjoy some of the characters from the unemployment army to hack into the IMASystem. Irshad Panjatan Gopal was a laugh. A few memorable moments also include Maiwald skating out of the CEOs office with a big fat grin on his face and Rainer smashing his Jaguar  but all this is not enough to save the movie. 510".

Weingartner's portrait of a sick and sickening life standard drawn by the TV world is very close to reality. The rather negative way in which the TV executives appear might even be called too optimistic  while in the movie they seem just to be immoral and very well knowing what they do reality might look somewhat worse Most of the people in charge are probably acting in accordance to their very own moral principles.One critic wrote Weingartner's movie is a crude comment on an even cruder television.

Blisteringly angry intelligent subversive and furiously cynical about contemporary society this is filmmaking as it should be.Wingartner's target is the dumbingdown of popular culture primarily via the medium of lowest common denominator television. It tells the story of Reiner a TV executive specialising in Reality TV  his latest project involves a sperm race between three contestants to win the opportunity to impregnate a woman  who experiences a Damascene conversion following an encounter with a woman whose grandfather committed suicide after being falsely indicted in one of Reiner's news shows. When his attempt to introduce intelligent programming bombs Reiner decides to artificially manipulate the TV ratings to force the channels to alter their schedules in favour of more informed material. Gathering a motley collection of unemployed workers  the unlikeliest band of anarchists you'll ever see  he audaciously sets off his own cultural revolution.A relatively simple story is wonderfully elaborated by a marvellously sympathetic cast. Moritz Bleibtrau now definitely laying claim to being the most interesting actor working today  just look at his resume for the last 9 years gives a tour de force as Reiner. His character's metamorphosis from cokesnorting brash yuppie to contemplative passionate man of reason is never less than convincing and a wonderful exhibition of his range and charisma. He's ably supported by the luminous Elsa Shultz Gambard unbelievably making her major film debut as his guiding angel. The direction  though potentially overindulging in montages just a bit  is uniformly superb allowing the actors free rein to tell the story. Nonetheless Weingartner's deferential camera is fully capable of stepping to the fore  the opening 6 minutes constitute probably the most exhilarating car sequence I've seen this year. Though dealing with decidedly academic political and radical themes Reclaim your brain's 129 minutes absolutely fly by. It's a blast.Anyone into cinema should see this film. Anyone who's bewailed current popular culture should see this film. Anyone who'd champion education over soma action over passivity or quality over quantity should see this film. And I mean SEE. At the postmovie QA Weingarter was disturbingly pessimistic about his ability to continue to make films. Getting the money to make this feature has apparently been a real struggle and he claims to have sunk most of his money from The Edukators into the project. How can I continue he asked if the people who aren't interested in this never see it he reckons it'll never be on TV and those who are copy the DVD or download it? Cinema tickets and DVD sales are all I have. I'm not going to preach regarding the crime of copyingdownloading but it'd be a genuine atrocity if this man went out of work. PLease go see.".

Critics and audience opinions on this film are a long way from congruence. While critics widely disparage the film as incongruent lacking in character message and the actor's performances as well as storytelling the audience largely welcomes the break with tradition and conventional film making. Free Rainer or Reclaim Your Brain is often compared to one of Hans Weingartner's previous projects 'Die fetten Jahre sind vorbei' IMDb Linkhttpwww.imdb.comtitlett0408777. While critics are not sure what the message of this story is exactly the audience knows without the shadow of a doubt that Hans Weingartner who not only directed but also cowrote the screenplay has made a manifesto out of this film  a manifesto and a cry of frustration over the general state of affairs in society at large. Free Rainer is not so much about the rebellion against bad television and corrupt program directors as it is about the emerging intellectual insurgence against today's values or lack thereof and the representative announcement of a large number of people wishing to steer away from a real life enactment of a Brave New World scenario as it was referenced in the film. Certain scenes which have been critiqued as superfluous might express the subconscious urge of the characters and film makers to escape our plastic world and dive back into the element of whence we came from. Prior to evolution. This film might be highly inspired which is why it might have to be analyzed using a different kind of lens nonlinear thinking to understand the film. It has received enough attention to deserve a more thorough look beyond the surface of conventional practicality. Aren't we living in a time where we can finally permit ourselves the luxury to be nonexclusively practical? Why shouldn't we allow ourselves to get lost in the jungle of different genres mixed in this film and at first glance nave sometimes lengthy philosophical or unnecessary scenes of this movie? Because we are not merely consumers  we are dreamers  and we claim the luxury to dream a more subtle dream one that doesn't make total sense to the conscious mind but speaks first hand to our subconscious desire for unsolved mysteries incongruence and contradictions which mirror real life so much better than those perfectly timed sequenced and portionsized films we get served on our twentyfourhour flights to oblivion. The lack of character depth and development some critics complain about might be an expression of the cathartic epiphany the characters experience upon meeting likeminded souls and embarking on a journey toward the elimination of the need for such forced upon limitations. Social phobia as described as one of the symptoms of the main characters is the theatrical measure of expression of the illness of society which becomes immediately inactive once the psyche embarks on a proactive search for liberation. The German title wears the tagline Dein Fernseher lgt!  Your TV is lying!. What the film tries to convey is that the movies and TV shows don't depict real life and rather paint a false fearful and overly negative picture of the world and life itself. In the course of the movie the characters show the audience real life by disengaging from the televisionset using television and literature when necessary as a tool rather than a crutch as mental stimulation rather than mental comfort food. Meeting our destiny head on versus escapism. The fact that every individual will have a unique reaction and widely differing opinion about Free Rainer is proof enough that it accomplished its goal To make a film that allows for creative individual and real life to find expression in a medium that should serve us not enslave us.".

	schema:reviewBody "Free Rainer is a German movie from almost 10 years ago that runs for over 2 hours and was written and directed by Hans Weingartner one of Germany's most acclaimed and successful filmmakers these days. And he made something pretty good here. I enjoyed watching this one for the most part and despite its massive runtime it never dragged only a bit. The lead actor here is Moritz Bleibtreu one of Germany's most famous for a long time now. Female protagonist is played by Elsa Sophie Gambard who interestingly never appeared in a film again after this one and works in the field of medicine today. The supporting cast includes a couple actors that you may have come across in other films but who are not too famous. most known may be Milan Peschel who plays a man with social phobia but who is usually better than in this one here. Austrian Gregor Blob on the other hand was a positive surprise as the main antagonist who takes aaglatt to the next level.The best thing however about this film is the excellent and spoton criticism on the German television landscape. There is so much crap on television right now that makes me wonder why television is on such a high level over there in the United States but here it sucks so hard. Even almost 10 years after this movie nothing has changed. Actually the already bad courtroom television shows got replaced by even worse fake reality television programs. So yeah all these references alone are reason enough to check out the movie. It has some problems in other areas though. First of all it is a bit on the predictable site but that's not the worst problem. The film is hurt more by a lack of shades. People are either 100 likable or 100 unlikeable and there is nothing inbetween sadly. This also results in some cringeworthy moments when the dialogs are just a bit on the holierthanthou side.However Free Rainer is absolutely worth checking out for its social commentary that in 2016 applies more than ever. I recommend this movie to everybody who reads this review here and has not yet seen it. It certainly also helps if you like Bleibtreu. I myself am fine with him without being a really big fan however so you don't need to adore him to appreciate his and Weingartner's efforts here. Yes it is not a very realistic film but with a huge funride early on when Bleibtreu's character is still one of the bad guys but a very authentic one and also pretty entertaining for the most part. Go check it out.".

First of all it is a bit on the predictable site but that's not the worst problem. The film is hurt more by a lack of shades. People are either 100 likable or 100 unlikeable and there is nothing inbetween sadly. This also results in some cringeworthy moments when the dialogs are just a bit on the holierthanthou side.However Free Rainer is absolutely worth checking out for its social commentary that in 2016 applies more than ever. I recommend this movie to everybody who reads this review here and has not yet seen it. It certainly also helps if you like Bleibtreu. I myself am fine with him without being a really big fan however so you don't need to adore him to appreciate his and Weingartner's efforts here. Yes it is not a very realistic film but with a huge funride early on when Bleibtreu's character is still one of the bad guys but a very authentic one and also pretty entertaining for the most part. Go check it out.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is my first review for any title. I have watched a whole lot of movies but never before felt so strongly an urge to share my opinion. I was actually looking forward to this one! I liked the underlying theme and always enjoy Moritz Bleibtreu one of our few great actors. He did deliver an outstanding performance  the movie nonetheless didn't. Here's why  The change of hearts of the main character is pretty much done in a cut from one scene in which he's still a selfloathing TV producer to the next where he isn't. Not much of a development there. It just sort of happens. The characters are all shallow and onedimensional AND badly acted except for the lead which Bleibtreu plays as well as the retarded script allows him toThe great problem the movie is based on DOES NOT EVEN EXIST! They say that TV quotas control everything in TV and keep quality stuff from being broadcasted. Now that may be true to privately owned networks  in Germany though as in other countries too it is stipulated by the law that public networks have to uphold a certain standard of higher culture and information in the public's interest. These networks are paid for directly by everyone whether they like it or not and do neither rely on advertising nor quotas! How can a TV producer achieve such a standing without understanding the difference between private and public networks? We all sure do! Maybe the writer should have researched just a tad more.Even if the fact I stated above wasn't true A society is not defined by what is shown on TV. Even if there weren't public networks but nothing but trash and stupidity on every channel There's still cinema literature music any kinds of art one can access without a TV. Believe it or not If you have read a book or magazine or visited an exposition someday without having had your TV telling you to you rendered the movie's sentiment false by doing so.In the course of events Rainer and his fellow shortthinkers suspect the quotas to be rigged Instead of a genuine elicitation they are instead forged by a few evil TV masterminds. While that is surprisingly not true later in the movie the group around Rainer become just precisely what they feared to be the truth a small group of people deciding on the quotas. How could nobody see that?! I thought well maybe that's where the movie shows us how they become corrupted by their newfound power or something in the likes of that  but no the moment passes and nobody seems to bat an eye.The movie states that there is bad and good TV. Nothing in between. The group never once fight about a broadcast some like whereas others don't. They just agree on everything saving the movie from an interesting turn of events.When they find out that the quotas are in fact not rigged but very much accurate they wonder how people could actually like and willingly watch trash TV. Rainer postulates that by having the networks shove trash into their audience's eyes for long enough the viewers regarded the trash to be normal and started to demand it. Solution Shove quality TV in their faces until the process repeats in favor of that. If this is true Is such a society worth being saved? Is anyone who just blindly consumes like that really going to appreciate a screening of say Eraserhead? This is a horrible dystopia  and again nobody seems to worry about that.After the world is saved and quality broadcasts have replaced the trash which was sent before people can be seen going outside again  so now that it would actually be good to watch they don't. What? Is all that's left to say.All in all this movie is a case in point for TV is stupid and following it's sentiment should have kept itself from being made. Avoid if you are looking for an intelligent well crafted and well written movie. Watch if you also enjoy videos of people falling on their faces. This is basically the same.".

Reified thinkingreversal of the subjectobject relationship is something to be shunned. Thus the rejection of the girl who is still hopelessly tied to yet another bureaucratic ideology.In Can Dialectics Break Bricks we have two fundamentally opposed forces at work the people who serve the bosses and vamp on the proles and the proles themselves who stand up to the bosses and their hired serviles. The radical subjectivity of the proles doesn't need the dead hand of an ideology to motivate them to action. No these proles are acting for themselves they are acting as a class for itself they've said goodbye to dead time. And they won't be happy until the last bureaucrat even ones claiming to be 'communists' is hung by the guts of the last capitalist. There's no room for manipulators of and apologists for wagelabour when being confronted by class conscious workers who want EVERYTHING. Nope no way. There will be no peace between these two classes until classes themselves are abolished. As hard as the bureaucrats in this film try to coopt these class conscious martial artists with promises of crumbs and hierarchical power the proles refuse. When offered the job of foreman one of the radical proles spits saying I don't want to be a petty boss. This film is an example of detournment a form of Situationist intervention in the society of the spectacle which involves taking film advertising or really any piece of standard ruling class media and turning it into its opposite a work of liberation against usual ideological domination. What's used here is a standard martial arts movie with all its gratuitous relatively contentless violence. And it works! What is originally meant to be taken seriously becomes a satire a filmic bullet in the heart of the sadistic domination of the ruling ideas of the era including those spouted by official leftwing critics e.g. Foucault as ideology gets a slap in the face along with the landlords capitalists and MarxistLeninist bureaucrats and dominators in general.Get your kicks see Can Dialectics Break Bricks!".

When offered the job of foreman one of the radical proles spits saying I don't want to be a petty boss. This film is an example of detournment a form of Situationist intervention in the society of the spectacle which involves taking film advertising or really any piece of standard ruling class media and turning it into its opposite a work of liberation against usual ideological domination. What's used here is a standard martial arts movie with all its gratuitous relatively contentless violence. And it works! What is originally meant to be taken seriously becomes a satire a filmic bullet in the heart of the sadistic domination of the ruling ideas of the era including those spouted by official leftwing critics e.g. Foucault as ideology gets a slap in the face along with the landlords capitalists and MarxistLeninist bureaucrats and dominators in general.Get your kicks see Can Dialectics Break Bricks!";

In any event if you ever have the opportunity to see this masterpiece by the French situationists you should definitely see it.The story line is simple a classic kungfu movie has simply had the entire dialogue changed to represent the epic battle between the proletariats and the bureaucracy with a martial arts school as the utopian commune.  That idea alone is comic genius and as if the idea wasn't funny enough the writing is hilarious.  For example when a little girl runs away from her little boy friend one of his friends comforts him and says something to the effect of Please forgive her for being a Marxist she just doesn't know better.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it was definitely unique but I also really think you would only enjoy it if you enjoy political satire and know a decent amount about different political viewpoints and hopefully socialist history.  I know a fair amount about these things and half the jokes were still lost on me.  In any event this is an excellent intellectual comedy and I recommend it to anyone who might find it the least bit interesting.Yes dialectics can indeed break bricks!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is coming from someone who doesn't often watch romantic comedies. Often romantic comedies involve the typical Jane Austenlike ending meaning always the same but for once it's good to see even the smallest bit of change in the genre and the change in this particular romantic comedynot that it changes all other clichs of the filmis that the protagonist is a man. Ollie is an Irish writer suffering from a fiveyearold case of writer's block that has caused him all the trouble be can get and his troubles get worse when an old womanizing school mate of his asks him to be his best man at his wedding and Ollie finds himself falling painfully in love with the bride Sarah. Though he tries to oppress his feelings and move on his best friend Murray goes through the most insane schemes to bring Sarah and Ollie together.Typical? Yes. Predictable? Very. Climax? Corny as a cornfield. But I can't deny that I did enjoy watching this film even if it did mean I would have to wash the girly side off of me for a week. I must admit I only wanted to see this because I've always had quite the crush on Stuart Townsend and I thought seeing him as a dork would be enjoyable because what kind of girl can resist a guy who can laugh at himself? Naturally I had to adore him as a lovable loser and I thought he was very enjoyable to watch. Of course I cannot forget his chemistry with Seth Green who is absolutely hilarious as the best friend who I have to say was one clever son of a gun! The way his insane antics worked was both hilarious and intriguing at the same time and clearly though he isn't even British Green has done his homework when it comes to British humor I sensed quite a lot of Jeff Murdock of Coupling in his performance. Unfortunately Amy Smart's performance was not at all remarkable. Her acting if acting is what you want to call it was very flat and her character also seemed just as such. To me she seemed much like the kind of character who's only there to be the typical suffering love interest without any quirk or edge whatsoever. Above all I thought the film was very much flawed on the lines of its lack of an original plot line but it was enjoyable to watch even if it was just for Townsend and Green who were most definitely the highlights of the film. I give the film an eight for its quirks but I won't praise it for the plot.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is coming from someone who doesn't often watch romantic comedies. Often romantic comedies involve the typical Jane Austenlike ending meaning always the same but for once it's good to see even the smallest bit of change in the genre and the change in this particular romantic comedynot that it changes all other clichs of the filmis that the protagonist is a man. Ollie is an Irish writer suffering from a fiveyearold case of writer's block that has caused him all the trouble be can get and his troubles get worse when an old womanizing school mate of his asks him to be his best man at his wedding and Ollie finds himself falling painfully in love with the bride Sarah. Though he tries to oppress his feelings and move on his best friend Murray goes through the most insane schemes to bring Sarah and Ollie together.Typical? Yes. Predictable? Very. Climax? Corny as a cornfield. But I can't deny that I did enjoy watching this film even if it did mean I would have to wash the girly side off of me for a week. I must admit I only wanted to see this because I've always had quite the crush on Stuart Townsend and I thought seeing him as a dork would be enjoyable because what kind of girl can resist a guy who can laugh at himself? Naturally I had to adore him as a lovable loser and I thought he was very enjoyable to watch. Of course I cannot forget his chemistry with Seth Green who is absolutely hilarious as the best friend who I have to say was one clever son of a gun!

I personally loved it due to the part that Seth Green's character Murray Brown had in it. He's quite the character. From the crotchless panties to the ostrich delivery man Seth Green brings the destined lovers together in the quirkiest way possible. Although it was interesting to hear Seth Green speak with a British accent after seeing him in other films with no accent I think he pulled it off amiably. Amy Smart's performance was as charming as usual. A great casting choice I think. She fills the role of a beautiful intelligent woman who rethinks her path to happiness through marriage fantastically. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good laugh. Bravo!".

	schema:reviewBody "My standards for comedy are so low that I can't think of one I didn't enjoy. Therefore it is doubly damning that I found this film tedious and unfunny. I guess if you are a 12yearold infatuated with Yuppies these cutouts might stimulate your imagination. But basically none of the characters light up.At fault is the failure to provide the little touches that make us identify. Now with the main character the film starts by pointing out he lost his ability to write at just the moment he received his first advance 50k. That's something but apparently the only upshot of that fact is he fears to write a short speech as best man in his friend's wedding. What promised to be a key insight into the character is dropped. The rest of the film is the tormented posturing of Yuppie types fulfilling various roles in a forthcoming wedding. With this misfire at character building he blends in with all the other males who have no defining traits and all look equally out of a clothing catalog. Yet all the males seem intimately involved with each other and their male networking even though none of them should have much to interest anyone so that I began to explain it to myself as if they were a group of Gay men who somehow lucked into roles as participants in a wedding. In fact if this had been the premise the film would have coalesced a little better. As for the women apart from a formal glamor they too had little to interest anyone. And all chemistry between the opposite sexes seems missing. But there were two incidents at variance with this. One is his life with his female employer who is very dissatisfied with his employment. It happens that he discovers she is only feigning to be a married woman and this discovery suddenly empowers him as a man. But then the scene cuts without telling us whether they made hay while the sun shined. In a similar incident a female discovers his ruthless gambits to break up his friend's wedding and she is similarly empowered. Again a hint of lust this time from her. And a scene cut.It is as if the film is compulsively drawn away from life and towards the purely manneristic involvement in the wedding planning. As the film progresses it is merely tedious and when some slapstick scenes arrive I was already so anesthetized I felt as if I were seeing it through a psychiatric haze. Finally he realizes he should be the groom. But no exuberance is actually conveyed to the audience. It doesn't make up for the leaden film we have endured. A late scene during the action packed denouement features a brief shot of him jetskiing across the Thames before the London Bridge a bit of American vulgarity in a film with phony British accents. Conventionally there would have been at least enough of this footage to give a feeling of exhilaration in the audacious flight over water. This too was poorly done.Give me back my money.".

	schema:reviewBody "Olly Stuart Townshend has aspired to be a writer from childhood. Yet after gaining an advance of 50 grand from a publisher Olly saw it all go up in smoke when he developed a major writer's block and could not complete his book. Instead he has taken a job as a personal assistant to be small publishing firm that specializes in selfhelp works for women. It is a position he detests. Fortunately Olly has two close friends that make life bearable. One is a somewhat uncouth businessman Murray Seth Green and the other is a polished university mate James Steve John Shepherd. When James becomes engaged and asks Olly to be the best man the young writer agrees. Yet when he attends an engagement party for the couple Olly falls instantly for the bridetobe beautiful Sarah Amy Smart. Murray suggests that Olly pursue Sarah and perhaps aid his own cause by digging up some dirt on James. But wouldn't that be the ultimate betrayal of his admittedly snobby friend? This is a sweet story for the target audience of romcom lovers. Although the tale is somewhat tried and true it still has some originality too. For example Olly receives an invitation to go out on the town with Sarah and her friends but declines saying he has to stay home and deworm the cat. Now if ever there was a great line of refusal that's it. But in addition the film's cast is quite fine with Townsend a dear as the heartsick best man and Smart a delight as the object of two men's affections. Green is also quite funny sporting a British accent as the film takes place in London. Costumes and production values are high as well. If you are a fan of funny love tales hitch a ride to locate this one if you have to. You will be very glad that you made the effort.".

The pacing made me want to gnaw off my arm but it was already gone from the previous screening of Death at a Funeral.You know you're in trouble when I spent the entire film wanting to see the movie based on the first two chapters of the unwritten Novel.However I saw this at a film festival. I was with a 21 year old guy and a couple of girls around the same age. The boy hated it the girls loved it and they all hated Becoming Jane earlier in the day.Thats probably more helpful if you're wondering whether to shell out the bucks for this cold turkey.".

	schema:reviewBody "PatSchnitzelPaella Western parody coproduced by FranceGermanySpain  it is packed with ridiculous situations  noisy action  exaggerated roles and lots of silly humor . Based on characters from comic books by Morris and writing credits by Ramzy Bedia  Michel Hazanavicius  Eric Judor  being badly directed by Philippe Ham Barracuda Secret Defense. This amusing as well as absurd picture contains an entertaining plot  action Western  shootouts and bits of campy and embarrassing humor . It deals with four Dalton brothers Eric Judor as Joe  Ramzy Bedia as Averell  Sad Serrari as Jack  Romain Berger as William and all of them take on Lucky Luke Til Schweiger. They are the worst outlaws in Wild West history whose criminal flops are such that their own mother is turning against them. This is a surprisingly lowkey Spaghetti Western in which four diverse characters joining forces to find a magic hat and rob a bank . But it's only once Ma Dalton Marthe Villalonga kicks her boys out of the home that they decide to make her proud by robbing a City Bank where security is so tight that even the bank tellers are combattrained. Having failed the robbery the brothers are thrown in prison  where their dimwitted Mexican cell mate exposes information about a magic hat that renders its wearer invincible. They immediately resolve to get the sombrero  so the boys escape of prison and head straight for Mexico and attempt to rob a fortune from a Bank . The Dalton Brothers breaking all the rules and kicking virtually every clich in the pants  as they relentlessly deceive plunder and rob. They go to Mexico leaving a trail of chaos in their wake where face off a villain named El Tarlo Javivi who besieges a village similarly to The magnificent seven .Western satire with a bemusing premise  there is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing shootouts fights or stunts every few minutes . It's an improbable blending of standard Western tongueincheek  silly humor  Comicbook and realized in SpaghettiFagioliTrinityTerence HillBud Spencer style . But the main problem is that if you are foreigner you will have to know well the French society to understand the doublesenses and jokes said by the four main actors playing Dalton Brothers . Amiable but sometimes lumbering Western satire goes on and on about the same premise  as a lot of minutes are superfluous it has half hour of excess  as it packs overblown jokes and antics and some moments turns out to be dull and tiring . The film mingles slapdash silly scenes pursuits and it's fast moving and embarrassing . The musician Alexandre Azaria  composes a jolly soundtrack with catching leitmotif and well conducted . Composer Alexandre Azaria was inspired by Alan Silvestri's scores for Back to the future III 1990 and Who Framed Roger Rabbit 1988 to such an extend that in several scenes the music sounds almost exactly the same . Colorful cinematography by cameraman David Carretero filmed on location in Cologne North Rhine  Westphalia Germany and Tabernas Almera Andaluca Spain . The picture is dedicated to Morris and Rene Goscinny . This is the worst version based on famous Lucky Luke comic books . Other adaptations are the following  Lucky Luke 2009 Played by Jean Dujardin  Mathias Sandor as Young Luke and television series starred by Terence Hill . And cartoon version as Go West A Lucky Luke Adventure 2007  The New Adventures of Lucky Luke La ballade Des Dalton 1978  Lucky Luke the intrepid 1971.".

This is a surprisingly lowkey Spaghetti Western in which four diverse characters joining forces to find a magic hat and rob a bank . But it's only once Ma Dalton Marthe Villalonga kicks her boys out of the home that they decide to make her proud by robbing a City Bank where security is so tight that even the bank tellers are combattrained. Having failed the robbery the brothers are thrown in prison  where their dimwitted Mexican cell mate exposes information about a magic hat that renders its wearer invincible. They immediately resolve to get the sombrero  so the boys escape of prison and head straight for Mexico and attempt to rob a fortune from a Bank . The Dalton Brothers breaking all the rules and kicking virtually every clich in the pants  as they relentlessly deceive plunder and rob. They go to Mexico leaving a trail of chaos in their wake where face off a villain named El Tarlo Javivi who besieges a village similarly to The magnificent seven .Western satire with a bemusing premise  there is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing shootouts fights or stunts every few minutes . It's an improbable blending of standard Western tongueincheek  silly humor  Comicbook and realized in SpaghettiFagioliTrinityTerence HillBud Spencer style . But the main problem is that if you are foreigner you will have to know well the French society to understand the doublesenses and jokes said by the four main actors playing Dalton Brothers . Amiable but sometimes lumbering Western satire goes on and on about the same premise  as a lot of minutes are superfluous it has half hour of excess  as it packs overblown jokes and antics and some moments turns out to be dull and tiring . The film mingles slapdash silly scenes pursuits and it's fast moving and embarrassing . The musician Alexandre Azaria  composes a jolly soundtrack with catching leitmotif and well conducted . Composer Alexandre Azaria was inspired by Alan Silvestri's scores for Back to the future III 1990 and Who Framed Roger Rabbit 1988 to such an extend that in several scenes the music sounds almost exactly the same . Colorful cinematography by cameraman David Carretero filmed on location in Cologne North Rhine  Westphalia Germany and Tabernas Almera Andaluca Spain . The picture is dedicated to Morris and Rene Goscinny . This is the worst version based on famous Lucky Luke comic books . Other adaptations are the following  Lucky Luke 2009 Played by Jean Dujardin  Mathias Sandor as Young Luke and television series starred by Terence Hill . And cartoon version as Go West A Lucky Luke Adventure 2007  The New Adventures of Lucky Luke La ballade Des Dalton 1978  Lucky Luke the intrepid 1971.";

In addition in Spain the movie was translated by two known humorist el Neng and Corbacho that could not be bad but they don't ever try to adapt themselves to the characters they just make their usual part like theirs on TV but with the faces of Joe and Averell Dalton.Surprisingly has two good things it is very short 82 minutes and the task of adapting the environment is quite decent not very much but it is the better of the film by far I am talking about the atrezzo which is the best adapted of all the movie which is not very difficult if we think about the horrible work of characters and history.

	schema:reviewBody "For years I was a big fan of Rene Gocinny comic books. Asterix Lucky Luke Iznogoud Pettit Nicholas which is not a comic book but a book but it's still very good Les Dingodossiers UmpaPa and all the rest he created. Fantastic stuff. After the second Asterix movie turn out to be very good I had big hopes for this one. The trailer was promising enough with cast and the visuals appear strongly similar to the comics.Sadly this movie turn out to be horrible! Story is bad and have little to do with the comics or even being a western spoof to be honest. Script is just mess with plot points handle poorly weak humor some times makes no sense and character are simply annoying especially the Daltons themselfes. The only positive thing I can say is that actros who played the four Dalton brothers did their best and you can tell they did put a lot of energy to their parts but it didn't helped much. It's just painful to see two talented actors stand there and throw horrible bad lines at each other while two just stend in background since as lest known actors they only got the leftover lines and are mute for most of the movie despite of being in 70 of the scenes.In fact I find it odd how on one hand the movie tries to make the Dalton brothers look like lovable loosers who are just trying to make their mother proud but at the same time still treat them like the villains of the story. So what the point? It must be confusing for the kids since mainly them will watch this and sadly the jokes are way to vulgar for them. Lucky Luke who is the main hero of the books have little to no screen time until the last 14 when he appears and captures the Daltons... Hurray? I don't get why they waste CGI for the character of Rantanplan since all he do is a quick cameo and his lines aren't even funny. There is a quick moment when the movie looks like it will turn into a spoof of the Magificent seven with the Daltons and got a little interesting... but that last for about five minutes and just got more terrible after that.By far the worst adaptation of a Goscinny comic book which lives nothing but bad taste.".

	schema:headline " And a 4 for The Atrocious Four of 2004...";
	schema:reviewBody "2004 saw the culmination of the sorriest trend that ever affected I should say infected French comedy stars first story later or never. It was perhaps the glorious age for TV comedians who could count on their fame to earn ticket passes for the big screen and while Alain Chabat's Asterix and Cleopatra was an exception because it was based on a classic comicbook two movies released in 2004 proved if it ever needed to be proved that you can have all the stars your producers' wallet can attract without a story you have nothing.It all started with the dreadful RRRrrrr!!! a film set in prehistoric times and whose only reason to exist was to give to TV surrealist comedic troop Robin des Bois a French poor man's Monty Python a chance to grace the silver screen for the first time. Closer to a disgrace it was also the last time they did a film together and only JeanPaul Rouve grew a honorable career out of it one he could owe to better choices and to his versatility. Chabat lost his Midas touch with RRRrrrr!!! but even the critical panning the film met didn't shake this craze over comicbooks. The year would see the release of Iznogoud and The Daltons both based on Ren Goscinny's iconic characters and both starring TV stars Michal Youn for the former and the 'Eric and Ramzy' duo for the latter.And both have in common that they would make Goscinny roll over his grave or die of a heart stroke if he was still alive as the stories are just excuses for actors to play their usual shtick under the fallacious homage pretext. We're supposed to laugh when Youn gets excited as when Ramzy acts stupid in The Daltons and makes Joe angry that's it. It's like sitcom humor elevated to the status of cinematic art form with the complicity of greedy producers who know how to disguise mediocrity under high production values. Because unfortunately what these films have in common is that they look good and professional enough to fool the viewers but that's the only luxury they couldn't not afford.So The Daltons is about one of the most iconic creations of the late Goscinny and Morris the four brothers whose escalating heights and contrasting personalities between the small shorttempered leader Joe and the tall but lovably stupid Averell contributed to some of the best pages of Lucky Luke and FrenchBelgian comicbooks. If that relationship worked in the film you had your film and why shouldn't it have worked? Eric and Ramzy have proved themselves capable to play duos with contrasting personalities Eric is talented enough to play the angry one and Ramzy to be stupid and I'm sure they grew up reading Lucky Luke like I did. But making a character likable isn't as easy as it sounds and that was Goscinny's strongest suit making villainous or stupid characters irresistibly funny.Indeed while Averell in the book is stupid it's an endearing form of stupidity we're supposed to laugh because it makes Joe angry the problem in the film is that Averell is so stupid and oblivious to his own stupidity that it makes us angry. I lost patience so many times I couldn't wait for Joe to smack his face and throws himself in a ravine after that. It's one thing not to stand characters but not when you have to deal with them every time. There's not one ounce of likability in the four of them one is an autistic imbecile another one is a sociopathic maniac and the two others are such worthless plotfillers they even got the names wrong Jack was supposed to be William and viceversa. So I'm not even sure anyone involved in the writing really took time to read Lucky Luke.Well I did read the books and being a fan when the film started I really gave it the benefit of the doubt making bandits comical isn't the most difficult task to achieve there have been comical holdups in the history of cinema and hilariously stupid guys so the film couldn't really miss its target. I could close my eyes on the random addition of Ma Dalton voiced by Marthe Villalonga the typecast Jewishmother of French cinema but I knew it was going downhill when my ears caught these two words magical hat. In the obligatory random cameomoment the Daltons' cellmate played by Kad Merad reveals the existence of a hat that turns you into a bulletproof human even if Lucky Luke is the shooter. Lucky Luke's adventures never indulged to Fantasy or Scifi so it's not good when the script relies on such desperate tricks.There were countless possibilities to make the movie work hell there was a simple one just adapt one of the twenty stories featuring the Daltons Goscinny's humor can't fail. No they had to come up with a lousy magical hat. I wish it was big enough so they could all hide under it a pitiful excuse to use CGI while it only worked for the shadows' gags of Lucky Luke it was totally overplayed with the hat. And you know there's something wrong when Lucky Luke played by a convincing Till Schweiger is the funniest character in the film. Eric and Ramzy suffer from the same syndrome as the Robin des Bois their appeal is limited to sketch or sitcom format one movie wouldn't be strong enough to sustain their comical 'talent'.And I remember The Daltons was the first movie I reviewed in a post after I had registered on IMDb I did it in French because the film had infuriated me so much I felt the need to vent my anger in my mothertongue. I'm not so surprised the post is still there 12 years after it's not like people have been watching it ever since. Good such an atrocity didn't deserve to become a classic.".

Can you imagine Moe as Joe Curly as Averell and Larry and Shemp as the other brothers. WOW!When I show the DVD to friends I mention that if they like the Stooges they'll like this film.Complaints about the lack of Lucky Luke's air time is valid but of course this is a film about the Daltons and Luke is just along to keep it interesting.The fiesta at El Tarlo's is wonderfully done and reminiscent of Three Amigos but a lot more surreal in nature..I recommend it as a nice diversion.".

Even though I haven't seen anything else with Eric  Ramzy I must say they are flawless in playing Joe and Averell Dalton. Joe is the stubborn bossy hothead he's always been and Averell is an utter moron who constantly aggravates his brother mostly resulting in a merciless battering. Til Schweiger does pretty good as Lucky Luke keeping his head cool and always being one step ahead. Too bad he doesn't have that much screen time but perhaps that is something to expect in a sequel.On the whole this is a nice movie and those who watch it ought to have an open mind and not mind American cowboys speaking French or people dressing mainly in primary colors like in an old western movie.".

I watched it because I am already a big fan of Eric and Ramzy and I was not disappointed. They deliver their usual style of comedy in the vein of their sitcom H but they also manage to stick very well to the Dalton characters popularized in the Lucky Luke comic books. Of course who else than Ramzy could play Averell.... There are many cameos by well known french comics such as Kad Merad or Elie Semoun great as usual playing several different roles in this movie. There is also dujardin in what is probably his worst part ever.The movie itself is very entertaining and festive and even if you don't appreciate the actors there is no reason not to enjoy the show. One particularly interesting point was the scenario rather original and unpredictable. Bad and predictable scenarios are generally the common point to cheap movies and this one was really surprising. The character of Lucky Luke is probably the east interesting part of this movie but this not a surprise in a movie about Les Daltons.I found this movie much more interesting than the latest cinema version of LUCKY Luke 2009 with Dujardin and Michael Youn which I was not capable of watching to the end because of the stupidity.So yeah I recommend to watch this movie especially if you like the aforementioned french actors but be warned the humour will probably not translate very well in other languages.".

It is in my 6th favorite Friday the 13th film. Melanie Kinnaman was one hot babe and great heroine she was good and her performance was decent. Melanie Kinnaman is the reason to watch this movie she is my fifth favorite final girl. Yes I put this movie over Friday the 13th Part VII The New Blood because I enjoy it that much. Different then the first four movies but the film is perfectly fine. Just because it tried something different it is bad? no it is fine I love this film to death. There is no Jason in here so whatever I love this film.There are creative deaths in the series has a gore and the special effects for the kills hold up and they are good. Not really the strongest film in the franchise I found it the weakest one but still watchable and I found it more enjoyable than Friday the 13th Part VII The New Blood. Yes I have enjoyed this movie much more then the last 4 films that come out after Friday the 13th Part VI Jason Lives. It is not a bad one it is a step down from The Final Chapter but still watchable movie. It is in my 6th rank in the Friday the 13th franchise and I still have fun with this film.The dinner scene was a fantastic death scene. Rebecca Wood as Lana was a good victim and I like the death kill. When the killer beheaded that biker guy Junior it was a good kill I like it. Tom Morga was a fantastic hockeymasked killer. Juliette Cummins as Robin was a hot great sexy babe. I like her as a victim. My favorite death scene is in which masked killer with an axe kills that junkie in front the dinner. Corey Feldman returns in this movie as Tommy Jarvis in the opening scene and I love his performance another reason to watch this movie. I like this film it is an alright slasher film not a bad one at all like most people are claiming. I am still going to watch this film. Watchable.The film did grown on me but the problem with the film in my opinion Is the lack of story because I don't know what this film has to do with A Friday the 13th when the story is set somewhere else away from Crystal Lake. They screwed up our favorite hero Tommy Jarvis in my opinion John Shepard is incredible lame as Tommy Jarvis and the screenwriter wrote Tommy Jarvis really dull confused and he looked like he was on drugs in this movie really high.Danny Steinmann R.I.P. who is no longer with us anymore. I respect Mr. Danny Steinmann and his vision of the movie what he was trying to do. Please my remorse goes to his family and rest in peace Danny you are really missed.Friday the 13th A New Beginning grew on me and I didn't thought it was horrible it is still watchable.".

I know it get's a lot of hate because it doesn't have a Jason in it but Tom Morga who played the hockeymasked killer was fantastic. It has good kill's and it is really my favorite 80's horror film. This movie reminds me on The Blob 1988 the diner scene my favorite horror scifi film.I love this film this time around the fourth time in the row it become guilty pleasure of mine.

You have my respect Danny Steinmann you were great director and your direction of this movie was solid and your writing ability for the screenplay was talented. Melanie Kinnaman as the blond Pam was good excellent heroin I loved her. I love that in this movie the hockey mask design in this movie fro the killer was blue. I love in which Pam fights off The Killer with a chainsaw really awesome climatic battle fight scene. I have enjoy this film and however I feel now it is better then Friday the 13th Part 2 because the killer wasn't so clumsy and the chainsaw worked in this movie. Just like the first movie it ravels about revenge. In the original film is Mrs. Voorhees and this movie has Roy paramedic the killer. I still love Part 2 to death but it does have confusing plot. Friday the 13th A New Beginning grew on me and I didn't thought it was horrible. I still don't like John Shepard as Tommy Jarvis but the movie more revolves around Pam and Reggie which I like. It is a good horror film. A 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I love this film and as far as I'm concerned it's the best of the series. Friday the 13th A New Beginning is vastly underrated by all the crybabies out there. Oh boo hoo where's Jason?! He's not here so get the hell over it already. Too many sequels that try to shake things up a little get shat all over for daring to not be a clone of what's come before. It's sad.I love the halfway house setting. It's a unique idea that naturally lends itself to some offbeat slasher fodder. I also find the area in which the film was shot surprisingly atmospheric. Along with the killer being unseen for the first time since the original it helps to make this a creepier entry in franchise. This is probably the most bizarre film in the series too which only makes it more endearing to me. The characters are great. From the quirky halfway house residents to the crazed backwoods hicks to the wacky Demon this film's characters are very entertaining and on many occasions quite amusing. I also love the direction in which they take the character of Tommy Jarvis having all these mental problems thanks to Mr. Voorhees. His hallucinations are actually rather eerie to boot. It's a damn shame they didn't continue the idea in Jason Lives which I consider to be one of the weakest entries in the series but that's another story for another review board.I think the kills in this film are some of the most original in the series. A leather strap crushing someone's head against a tree a road flare to the mouth a cleaver decapitation while riding a motorcycle among others aren't your typical slasher kills. I also love the fact that the killer is copycat Roy. It's a nice refreshing take. I always see people whine about Jason not being the killer here but I say it's better that way. I think having chocolate bar boy be his son was a nice twist. Funny how he kills everyone but his son's killer but I'm sure he couldn't get to him with the authorities taking him into custody.I could go on and on about how enjoyable this film is. It has a real charm to it and it's a shame that so many consider it one of the low points of the series even the worst. I was disappointed to see this film on the IMDb bottom 100 a good while back. It's no longer on the list so that's cool.And remember Yya don't sset a place for a dead person!".

	schema:headline " One Of The Best Slashers Ever";
	schema:reviewBody "The status of Friday The 13th Part V A New Beginning as the least popular film in the series has always frustrated and perplexed me. Masterfully directed by Danny Steinmann it is a supremely entertaining exploitation slasher film. The most common reasons given seem to be a there's not enough gore b the story is stupidthe acting isn't very good c Jason isn't in the movie. Of course none of these explanations is valid. First of all if gore alone is your litmus test to determine whether or not a film is enjoyable you should probably steer clear of the entire Friday The 13th series as well as any movie that has been subjected to the wacky ratings system and experienced a wide theatrical release. Go watch I don't know a Guinea Pig film. A New Beginning has as much gore as any of the Friday films. If a strong plot and acting of the highest caliber is important to you well let's be honest criticizing A New Beginning for its silly plot is like dismissing Van Gogh because you don't like the color yellow. You're missing the point. Yes I sort of understand the complaint that Jason isn't in the movie as he is my favorite of the classic maniacs. Cropsy Marty Michael Meyers and Angela round out the top five. But his absence alone shouldn't ruin the whole movie for you. I'd rather watch an entertaining movie that alludes to yet doesn't feature the actual Jason as opposed to a boring movie that completely screws up his mythology. Here's a clue. It comes after VIII and before X.Friday The 13th Part V A New Beginning works because it takes the elements that make a good slasher film and completely exaggerates them. All irony aside A New Beginning is a trashy sleazy exploitative masterpiece. The very premise of having Jason hack up a group of mentallyill teens which includes two nymphomaniacs an angry sociopath a chocolate loving man child a newwave goth who likes to dance and a stutterer is indicative of the sickminded oozy greatness of this movie. Jesus I haven't even touched upon the motherson hillbilly biker duo or Demon! This movie has more great characters than the entire Halloween series combined! Are you not entertained by Demon in his shtbox singing Oooh Oooh Baby. Oooh Oooh Baby to his sexy girlfriend before being impaled? How could this be? Are you made of stone? Are you? Do you not enjoy watching Violet who is the most uniquely attractive female in the entire Friday series do the robot to Pseudo Echo before being killed? I love her with all my heart. What about Ethel and Junior the most vile hatefilled loony hating hicks to ever interact with a stained voyeurdrifter? Junior's decapitation after being pummeled by Tommy following a prank which consisted of shining a light in his eyes is a fitting end for the angry dullard. Oh and Vic? The greatest red herring in slasher history. He violently kills Joey after the overweight stereotype accuses him of being out of line. Harsh words from a strange man! The number of kills in this movie dwarf the previous Friday record. Subsequent sequels had more but with the exception of Jason X another unjustly maligned classic not by much. The fact that most of these kills are peripheral to the story unnecessary and hilarious only adds to their quality. Case in point the hideously obnoxious cocaineaddicted mental health worker Billy who picks up Lana the waitress at the diner. She who proceeds to get naked while saying It's showtime! to herself in the mirror. You don't see the entertainment value in that my friends? Following this odd display a cat bafflingly drops from above and bounces clumsily and hard off a booth. It was a cheap shock and laugh at the same time! Shortly thereafter Billy and Lana are both killed with enough blood to make it all worthwhile. That entire scene is mesmerizing. And let's not forget the two jerks with the broken down car who appear earlier in the film. They're greasers! Greasers! I watch slasher films not for genuine scares or insightful twists but to be entertained. And I am usually entertained by their exploitative depths bloody action nudity uniquely stupid characters and the basest nihilism of it all. I simply cannot see how anyone could argue A New Beginning doesn't contain every single one of these qualities in excess. It's a sleazy vicious offensive slasher that epitomizes everything that makes the genre popular. The time has come to reevaluate this amazing film and give Steinmann the credit he deserves.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are a few Friday fans out there that can actually enjoy this film for what it is instead of complaining about what it's not.Yes the plot is a big departure from the previous films but once you get over it it's a pretty fun '80s slasher film with plenty of creative kills and some great chase sequences.The acting is surprisingly solid for a series' fifth entry as well. I really never understood the complaints about the acting in these films as to me it's always been passable and certainly above most of the slasher ripoffs the decade was littered with.This time the action takes place at a halfway house in the sticks where Tommy Jarvis survivor of the previous bloodbath comes to stay after an undetermined amount of time in a mental hospital. But Tommy can't seem to catch a break as the bodies of the troubled kids soon begin piling up after his arrival. Is it Jason? Tommy? One of the locals who has a grudge against the disturbed kids? I won't spoil that here.This film has the highest body count in the series with barely enough time to breathe before the next murder is set up. Thankfully the series retains its creative flair when it comes to dispatching the victims. Some highlights include a head crushed against a tree with a leather strap a road flare being improperly used and a death in an outhouse. There's also a nice moment you can only get in '80s horror involving a girl doing the Robot dance in her bedroom to Pseudo Echo's catchy song His Eyes. Terrific.If there's anything that sets this sequel apart from its brothers and sisters it's the overall tone of the film which is much darker this time around. This can be good or bad depending on what you prefer a fun slasher sequel like part 3 this is not.The final 20 minutes really get the action going as well. Fans of nudity will also rejoice as this has the most pair of breasts shown in a Friday the 13th film to date.I found this better than part four which I realize puts me on a chopping block with other fans. But I call it like I see it.".

It had real suspense as to who the killer was I mean we all know it was not Jason he was dead.It had a lot of different death scenesand it was all in all a good film. it had the 3 rules for making a successful sequel..... 1Body count is always bigger 2The death scenes are more elaborate 3 Never ever ......... oh sorry back to the comments .....Thinking about it the ending was kind of like a Scooby Doo ending as to why he did it.The man responsible had a perfectly simple and plain motive revenge.Im not going to say what he wanted revenge for or who he was not it was simple.I kind of figured it out that the killer was not Jason when he gets hurt by many objects you can hear him moan in pain Jason is a member of the Living Dead Club which means he is the living dead. And he dont really feel pain.Tommy Jarvis returns in the film.Corey Feldman is also in it as well but he has a sort of cameo role. I do not understand why Tommy is in a mental Institute I mean he is still freaked out by the murder of his mother and friends at the hands of Jason Voorhees.So if you want to find out who killer is and why he did it then rent out this film or if youre a horror fan like me buy it and add it to your horror collection.I give this movie a 8 out of 10.Because of the Crazy new beginning. well it has not really got a new beginning but it is a Pun ........get it????Do Not worry.".

	schema:reviewBody "Friday the 13th Part V A New Beginning. This sequel is actually one of the best in my opinion except for the lousy ending. Friday the 13th Part V A New Beginning does everything correctly through the first three quarters of the movie. We start off with the plot of Tommy Jarvis being sent to a halfway house for troubled teens and there he is plagued by visions of Jason Voorhees. So we now have a fresh twist that the movie isn't to be set about cabins in the woods again which is a breath of fresh air. Then we have the absolutely fantastic array of characters all of which are rememberal and great to watch. Ethel and Junior provide comical relief as the hillbilly mother and son we feel sympathy for Jake Violet and Robin who are all great people to watch interact. The characters are all interesting and all have their own personal traits which makes them work instead of them all just wanting to party drink smoke and have sex so this is also a step in a new direction. Out of all of the Friday the 13th instalments Friday the 13th Part V A New Beginning probably has the most memorable characters and some fantastic scenes with them for example when Anita and Demon sing whilst he is on the toilet or when Violet is dancing the robot. Friday the 13th does have some very memorable and inventive death scenes as well although plot holes and continuity issues do fall through think and fast. There is some nudity as well mainly from Debbie Sue Voorhees which is very enjoyable. The script can get very lame for instance the conversations between Billy and Lana. However the twist ending is that Jason Voorhees wasn't behind these murders but it was instead a copycat who was killing off the teens after his estranged son was hacked up at that very same halfway house. This is quite a let down but seriously don't let this put you completely off. Jason takes a vacation but this filler still delivers the goods.".

The sequence where Shepherd singlehandedly knocks the hillbilly cold is a highlight.A lot of fans hate thisit's dismissed as the film without Jason and considered along with part 3 as the worst of the series. I disagree. It's no masterpiece by any means but I was always entertained. I give it a 7.".

I mean you wouldn't make a Rocky film without the Italian Stallion. But once I put that disappointment aside and judged this work on its own merits I was pleasantly surprised.Of course A New Beginning is far from perfect. Most of the characters are onedimensional and unappealing and the thrills are few and far between. When people complain about the senselessness of gory movies this is the sort of effort they're talking about. Yet for all its faults A New Beginning boasts a fairly interesting by genre standards storyline as the maniac slashes his way through a facility for troubled youth. Among the tenants is Tommy Jarvis still plagued by nightmares of hacking up Jason years earlier. There are even a couple of unintentional laughs amid the corny dialog and the exciting barn finale yes they've done a barn finale before but bear with us is a highlight that holds up well.The biggest failure here is the attempt at a Scooby Dooish mystery element. The writers perhaps envisioned the audience gasping in the final frames when Roy the ambulance driver's face is revealed beneath the goalie mask. But did anyone actually remember this guy? I had no idea who I was looking at until the dialog revealed his identity. Roy just wasn't prominent enough for us to remember. The producers' desire to go in a different Jasonless direction showed they didn't really understand their audience. These fans ask for something a bit different each time but they certainly don't want the wheel reinvented as the failure of Jason Goes to Hell again illustrated eight years later.More than twenty years after its release A New Beginning remains the most controversial entry in the series.

I thought that was smart then keep bringing Jason back again. My main point is Give it a watch! its extremely entertaining there is a high body count and amazing score. Yes it has its week moments but overall its a lot of fun to watch. Any true Friday the 13th fan must watch!".

A fat patient named Joey Dominick Brasca who annoys the other patients and one of them named Vic Mark Venturni hacks him up then gets arrested. However things may look safe at the haven for Tommy as he befriends a young boy named Reggie Shevar Ross who is the grandson of one of the workers. But unfortunately a killer is on the loose in the town but is it really Jason back from the dead or someone in his footsteps? Considered by fans as the worst of the Paramount Friday The 13th movies this one isn't that bad as they said it was. This movie was originally considered a new beginning after Jason died in the last movie and the makers wanted to make the series into something different with a new killer in each installment which is kind of similar to Halloween III Season of the Witch in concept of a different horror movie in each installment. Fans of Jason rejected this idea and wanted the goalie back and they got their wish with the next installment. This part of the series costars a cameo by Corey Feldman and even has Miguel Nuenz Jr. of Return of the Living Dead fame which should surprise fans of the horror genre.There's a lot of graphic killings in this one as it has a body count of 20 dead people with some good kills of skullcrushings implements stabbings and that kind of thing. A couple of sexy naked chicks including a topless blonde waitress who is just gorgeous as hell and of course some twists with turns.Overall it's not that bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was by no means a bad move to make more Friday the 13th's following number 4 The Final Chapter. This ressurection of the esteemed Jason Voorhees fails miserably. Like entry number 9 Jason Goes to Hell this installation is too far removed from the others in terms of storyline taking it away from Camp Crystal Lake and the usual plots. The extremely large cast also take away screen time from each other meaning 95 of the cast we simply do not care about them which is very wrong.Another way this film strays from the normal horror routines is by having a male in the lead John Shepherd as Tommy though it's not like he is present very much and he is so boring that he is painful to watch a far cry from Corey Feldman and Thom Mathews who play Tommy in parts 4 and 6 respectively. Few horror films have males in the lead though others include A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 and Prom Night 3 some argue that a male lead doesn't work as well as female I think it depends on the characters.Another difference between A New Beginning and the previous entries is that there are a lot of adult and authority figures present though the authority only works to a certain degree. Richard Young plays Matt the head of the home Tommy is put in and while he does an okay job his authority is not that present. The supposedheroine of the film is Pam Melanie Kinnaman and once more to be different than the previous films she is not a teen but assistant head of the home Tommy and the other teens are in and once again this change doesn't work well not to mention she is almost as bad as Kari Keegan's Jessica the heroine from part 9.While the film is littered with a boring and  or useless cast and characters there are a few highlights. Shavar Ross plays Reggie another child like Tommy was in part 4 and I must say Shavar Ross can scream better than any of the women in this film. Carol Locatell is great as the crazy neighbor Ethel and the only two teens that one could really care for Eddie and Tina played by hottie John Robert Dixon and Debisue Voorhees who had great hair also get the best deaths. Of the other teens none are particularly noteworthy except perhaps Tiffany Helm who plays Violet  but only for her hair.Now a major reason that the film just doesn't work is because it is not Jason doing the killings which i might add are in general not very gory but a paramedic called Roy played by Dick Wieand who discovers his son has been killed at the home Tommy and the others stay at so he uses Jason's old M.O to get revenge. Admirable but doesn't quite hit the mark. So unless you are a diehard Jason fan then I would recommend watching parts 2 or 7 far superior sequels.".

It's not because of its overall poor quality but because this time Jason is an imposter a man seeking revenge for the death of his son. This fact is not revealed until the very end but since it is such common knowledge among genre fans I feel blameless in discussing it here. The truth is the film is so arbitrary that it would have made no difference even if Jason had truly risen from his grave where he must have been rolling for the duration of the film. Director Danny Steinmann seems to be aiming for a murder mystery type of story suggesting that the killer may be a mental patient or some redneck. However this element is so ineptly handled that it simply doesn't matter. It's just a bad slasher movie that lurches from one kill scene to another peopled with cartoonishly obnoxious characters who deserve what they get. There's plenty of gore and female nudity but even then it never rises from the muck.For the most part the performances are strictly amateur night although John Shepherd does a decent job as Tommy Jarvis a decade or so after part 4. Shavar Ross does his best though kid characters in horror movies are almost always annoying. Exception Halloween Melanie Kinnaman is okay at least she doesn't embarrass herself. Otherwise most of the actors who shall remain nameless deserve to have their SAG cards torn up especially that Michael Jackson wannabe. Why do actors do these movies anyway? Are they that desperate for the money? Don't they know that appearing in a Jason flick is a guaranteed careerkiller? I think one actress was denied a promising role in an Oliver Stone film for that reason. To be fair there's little that can be done with such poor material.The only good part is the flashback in the beginning featuring a cameo by Corey Feldman. Otherwise it's pure and utter drivel poorly acted discounting the above exceptions written and directed. I'm not a snob I actually enjoyed parts 6 and 7 at times though otherwise the films are just average slasher movies. I'm giving this one a bad review simply because I found no chills or thrills in this unfortunate sequel. I tend to be fairly critical of horror movies and this one deserves a good thrashing. Didn't this one actually send fans protesting at Paramount's gates? See even with the fans you can't throw just anything at them they know what they want too.12 star out of Released by Paramount Pictures".

There are however some hilarious comedic moments now and then in the movie. It's one reedeming quality is the acting portrayed by John Shepherd as Tommy Jarvis. The portrayal of Tommy as a seriously disturbed young man after his encounter wJason is very realistic for it shows the constant fear anger sadness and paranoia of surviving that horrific night from Friday the 13th part IV. Some pluses were the settings they used which were used effectively. The infamous rain storm the woods the barn and the final chase scene near the end are all on nice display here.

	schema:headline " Fragments of a better film put as a whole but none of them able to sustain or lift the final product";
	schema:reviewBody "I was very much on the sidelines but even I noticed some back and forwards over the film Noah. Some seemed furious that it was not in line with Biblical teaching while others seemed to take glee in the religious objections to the film for me I don't really have a dog in that fight so the fuss did not interest me and the film didn't seem like something I wanted to pay 10 a seat to go and see. That said I was curious to watch it because I found it hard to believe that Darren Aronofsky would churn out a blockbuster without something of interest in it.The film wastes no time with adding flesh to the basic bones of the story and if you're looking to get upset by the presence of fallen angel rock monsters then the film serves them up to you right at the front. I guess if you came to see a bible story then this may upset you since the bible does not mention these creatures but for me coming to a film I really don't care what characters it creates or devices it uses as long as they work. From here we find Noah living with his family separate from men tending to a nature that the others exploit  again an environmental message of stewardship that oddly upset those that proclaim the bible as the truth. As per the story the message comes of the destruction of man and Noah along with his family and rock monsters get to building an ark for the animals which will be saved to repopulate the world. It is quite the story and if you are honest were it not for the fact that it is lifted from the bible it is a story that would pretty much get laughed out of any pitch meeting.So it is to the film's credit that although it is inherently senseless it makes a decent fist of telling it. Given the resources available it does this primarily by throwing effects and scale at the viewer. This works to a point and it is a pretty good looking film with some particularly memorable scenes. The main thing for me that offered interest was that the central character of Noah is essentially a religious extremist who is dooming a world of men to death because of something god told him. The film disappoint though because it doesn't do enough with this. It plays it straight and sets it up and there are points where you are not sure who is the good guy here since Tubalcain is really just trying to survive death likewise the obsession of Noah of ending man's time on Earth and only leaving animals. It doesn't work though because it doesn't go harder on this and instead of drawing us into the madness of his obsession and the terrible things he therefore stands by and watches the film actually feels plodding and not entirely sure of itself throughout these aspects. On the other side of this the film never throws itself into the epic effects blockbuster camp either and while noisy and large the action sequences don't really work either.It doesn't feel like an Aronofsky film it doesn't feel like there was much here to challenge or to be explored  or rather it does feel like there is but the film doesn't go for it. The cast play it straight and professionally but not always to the film's benefit. Crowe in particular is a straight bat and even when he is acting in extreme ways you feel like he maybe doesn't get it since earnestness is his consistent approach throughout. Connelly and Watson are both more expressive and I guess the idea was that their performances would be our way to experience the darker side of Noah's steadfastness. Winstone gives out a good series of gowls when called upon but again his weaknesses are more to do with the film not exploring his character and Noah better to be fair though I am so sick of his floating head on the TV encouraging me to gamble with mockney geezerisms that I wasn't keen to be stuck with him again here.Noah is not an awful film mainly because it is basically lots of fragments of better films put together. So the spectacle is good at times but never goes for it while the character piece is hinted at but not given over to in a way that really works. Everyone plays it down the middle of these and there is not too much of interest beyond the moment  which is a shame for a film so long and filled with such talent.".

Some of the scenery and shots featuring animals were really cool I found myself wishing for more that is more time spent on animals...and a closer look at different species as imagined by the creators of this film.Ray Winstone is a distinguished actor but I found his portrayal at times creepy at times laughable overall weak how much of this was due to direction andor other factors...not sure when it comes to this film I didn't get a sense either way. Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly impressed me I got a sense of quiet strength from their characters.Russell Crowe also one of my favorite actors I thought his Robin Hood was masterful a fresh new take disappointed. Without giving anything away there were some parts of this film that called for a more dramatic narrative...his timing and at times rushed speech took away from the grandeur of what was meant to be an epic film. You find yourself wishing he would deliver certain lines a bit more theatrically like David Wenham in 300 or one of the greats of classic film Charlton Heston perhaps.I didn't realize when I started watching that Anthony Hopkins was also in the film. When he popped up on screen I laughed and thought 'Of course...can't make an epic film without Anthony Hopkins!' Probably just me but it seemed a bit tired as far as casting goes. I might have enjoyed it more on the big screen but don't regret watching at home on my TV. Bottom line entertaining enough to watch...just a bit of a letdown.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been an IMDb lurker for several years and this film was so poor that I felt motivated to write my firstever review. It's bad on so many levels I'm not even quite sure where to begin...Storyline This film probably represents the biggest rickroll I've ever seen. Naturally when people see a film about a great flood titled Noah the automatic assumption is that it's a retelling of the biblical story. This film cynically exploits that expectation and then drops a hammer on the bewildered audience. I believe most people who watch this film will recognise that something is deeply wrong in it's portrayal but they're less likely to realise that the fundamental reason is because the director has flooded pun intended his movie with imagery and references based not in Christian theology but Gnostic mysticism. I'm not Christian so I wasn't offended by this perspective on a theological level but that didn't lessen my disappointment on a cinematic level at all. Special effects Wow. Just... Wow. The effects in this film wouldn't look out of place in Jason and the Argonauts or The Golden Voyage of Sinbad. If you're not familiar with either of these much better movies it's possibly because you weren't born when they were produced way back in the 60's and 70's. In any case it saddens me to know that in 2014 effects of this standard are deemed acceptable for general release. But as soon as I finish this review I'll be dusting off my Magnavox for a quick game of Wipeout just to complete the sensation of timetravel.Acting This film sports a strong cast with some of my favourite actors and most of them discharge their duties as well as might be expected given the script they're stuck with. I did feel there was some overacting with some of the more emotionally loaded scenes but overall I'm more disappointed with the cast for accepting their roles than how they actually played them.Conclusion Dear reader I implore you. Go for a walk. Read a book. Call that friend you haven't caught up with for ages. Do anything but watch this film. I didn't pay to watch this mockery but I still feel cheated. My OH slept through most of it and I feel jealous. If you avoid it altogether after reading this and other reviews then I can at least feel like I've done my good deed for the day.".

	schema:reviewBody "Judging from the hate Noah has gotten on here I was expecting very little. Actually Noah was nowhere near as bad as heard and while very flawed and by far the worst film of Darren Aronofskywith his others ranging from very good to outstanding it did have some impressive things. On the most part the film is brilliant visually the barren apocalyptic landscapes and later more colourful ones were really striking and the cinematography has a sweeping yet somewhat surrealistic effect. The opening and creation sequences were beautifully done with the latter quite harrowing without being too heavyhanded and the flood scene was intense and jawdropping in spectacle. Noah's dreams had a real creepiness too. Clint Mansell's music score swells thrillingly and has an epic sweep enhancing crucial scenes and not drowning stuff out. The sound is thrilling in its authenticity too. There are some good performances the best of which coming from Russell Crowe who plays with real steel and a powerful charisma. Jennifer Connelly is a sympathetic and touching wife and mother figure and has a scene in the last act that really does hit home and is not overthetop. Some have disliked Emma Watson's performance but for me she brought genuine heart to a role that was more of a plotdevice up until the last act at that point she becomes the character you relate to the most. Anthony Hopkins does not have much to do but he is gleefully enjoyable in his role of Methusalah.Noah did personally fall very short though and actually the little relation to the Bible no matter how people carp on about it is the least of its problems. Douglas Booth is rather bland and too prettyboymodellike while Logan Lerman came across as wooden and forced Ham could easily have been the character we related to but for that to happen I think the film could have expanded much more on his character arc and situation. Ray Winstone is the most disappointing he's done some great performances but this is not one of them he is saddled with a very clichd villain role that has no development to him and he overdoes it in a way that feels straight out of another film entirely. The characters generally are underdeveloped especially the villain and Ham's subplot had potential to be expanded much more but Ila's character has a lot of heart and effort is made to humanise Noah although some of his decision making comes across as rather sudden. The special effects are a mixed bag the flood effects are outstanding and the builttoscale ark also looks incredible both of which with much grandeur. But the Rock Monstersor the Watchers have a dated look are written in a way that feels irrelevant to the story or in a way that doesn't gel with everything else going on and slightly like Transformers clones and some of the animalsnotably the snakes look like computerised toys that don't blend within the scenery very well. The dialogue does often feel stilted and confused especially in the first act while taking an overwrought if wellintentioned turn in the last and coming across as a little heavyhanded in places. The story does have a number of bright spots and contains some powerful messaging but does drag a fair bit and has some stuff that felt like filler the film easily could have been halfanhour shorter. The story is also a bit of a weird one and one that leaves more questions than answers in a sense that it does feel like it doesn't quite know what it wants to be there's some scifi some actionepic and some characterdriven studywhich takes up the last act all three of which with uneven results. The ending is for my liking a bit too convenient as well. Aronofsky's direction is broad and is at home with the style of the film and the spectacle but he fails to make the story properly engagewhich is unusual for Aronofsky. Overall ambitious but uneven. Noah is nowhere near as bad as a lot of the negative reviews have said and the stick it gets for not being close to the Bible is on the unfair side in all fairness though Noah was advertised in a way that was suggestive that it was an adaptation of the biblical story when really it is the bare bones but it does have a lot of flaws and could have been better considering how much talent was on board. 510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " They should have called it something else";
	schema:reviewBody "Having watched the trailers I was so looking forward to this film and even took my friends. As the Bible account of Noah can fit into a page of A4 obviously the film makers had to add a lot of plot to fill it out to a feature length film. Indeed there is a lot of scope to do this Noah's wife and his three daughtersinlaw are hardly mentioned in the Bible not even being named so the filmmakers had to develop their characters and could create interesting subplots around the various relationships. In the film Noah has a series of dreams about the flood now this is not mentioned in the Bible but it is certainly one of the methods God uses to communicate with men so it is an addition rather than a distortion and adds a bit of excitement and gives them a chance to show off their skills with CGI.But to call the film Noah surely requires that they leave the basic storyline intact. But they didn't. The angels who came to earth because they fancied the women were turned into bizarre stone men very uncomfortable for the women but they didn't go into that as a consequence the Bible description of what happened to their offspring had to be abandoned. Instead of taking three daughtersinlaw onto the ark they took one girlfriend who Noah thought was infertile. One of Noah's enemies managed to sneak onto the ark without Noah's knowledge. Perhaps the worst thing in my opinion was that God was left on the sidelines and couldn't even make the decision himself to preserve humans or not so left that decision to Noah.So whether or not we agree with the personality they decided to give Noah is a matter of individual taste. Drugging the animals so they didn't interfere with the film may have been a copout but we could have gone along with that. But playing fastandloose with the story just seems unnecessary. Who is the film aimed at?All in all very disappointing. Bring back Cecil B. DeMille!".

As the Bible account of Noah can fit into a page of A4 obviously the film makers had to add a lot of plot to fill it out to a feature length film. Indeed there is a lot of scope to do this Noah's wife and his three daughtersinlaw are hardly mentioned in the Bible not even being named so the filmmakers had to develop their characters and could create interesting subplots around the various relationships.

Even giving it that benefit it was one of the worst movies I have seen. I was not expecting a completely Biblical account of the Noah story and knew that additions to the story would have to be added since the Bible version is quite brief. However who would have thought that would mean weird talking Rock creatures which looked like they came from a Transformer movie. And the area where Noah lived was totally barren rock....until he planted the seed Methuzalah gave him and immediately an entire forest shoots up out of the ground to supply wood to build the ark. When the flood came instead of it starting to rain huge columns of water were shooting up from the ground. What's with that?I was especially looking forward to the animal scenes since the Humane Society commended the director for not using any real animals in the filming. Well that was more than obvious! Computer animation has come a long way over the years but this movie apparently used one of the earliest versions of CG. It looked totally fake and all occurred in about a minute. The acting was terrible including Russell Crowe. And the script was even worse. After a very climactic scene where he almost killed the twin babies in a state of rage he explains that All I saw was love. I almost left at that point!If one reads all the reader reviews I think it will become apparent that most of the viewers agree with my comments. At the end of the movie our audience spontaneously let out an audible groan. I have never heard such negative comments as people were walking up the aisle.Save your money!".

'Noah is an imagining of the biblical story not a reimagining because the Bible really doesn't have much to say about the flood story that people really want to knowhe mechanics of it.My goal was to go into the theater considering this film to be separate work from the book as I do with all films. If you pretend you know nothing of the original text I am afraid this story does not stand well on its own.First of all you would expect that Noah would be the hero of the story. Actually he was about the least likable character in the film.Noah is a man who has what he takes to be revelatory dreams. Through them he predicts future happenings and modifies his life accordingly. But he is a very bad prophet because he never seems sure he understood the messages. The most dramatic part of the film is when he tries to understand what the creator's intentions are for the race of man. He thinks he knows and he makes bombastic speeches about it but he obviously is not sure. Still he acts on his best suspicionsor intends to act. When it comes down to it he wavers. And a teenage girl has to explain to him the basics of free will.If you were hoping for some interesting explanations about the mechanics of the ark and how all those animals were saved you will be disappointed. The explanation we get is like saying that Santa Claus manages to visit all the homes around the world in an impossibly short time because he has magic reindeer. In the story Noah has helpers that are no less magical. And the depiction of every species of animal that crawls walks or flies since this story does not consider evolution none of the species could have evolved after the flood is very lame. I don't know what I expected but it was something more realistic.I found the acting to be fine. The most enjoyable aspect of the film for me was Emma Watson's performance. The special effects were okay. But not enough to make me forget the deficiencies in the story.".

It didn't make the story about Noah more plausible but it was a great story set in timeless environments. I have read the genesis story even though I'm not a Christian and in my opinion this adaptation is quite accurate and true to the biblical story with some tweaking here and there. A little gnostic view points here and there but all in all something fresh made from a old and boring book made a little bit more interesting.

	schema:reviewBody "I guess it was always going to be difficult for those behind the movie to create a film that both stayed relatively true to the Bible's admittedly brief description of the life of Noah and that appealed in some way to a wide and not always theist audience. They sort of failed however.One of the problems I suppose to much of the audience was that we already sort of new what would happen and thus tension was practically nonexistent although in saying that there have been some outstanding biographical films so that's not really an excuse. The production team knew the story too and this may be why they left the occasional hole in what was already a thin stretched plot for example Noah has a couple of vague visions and immediately knows exactly what to do. There have been a few complaints about the giant Hulklike rock angel things and whilst they didn't necessarily need to be there they at least fitted into the story with a bit of a squeeze. They weren't the worst of the films problems anyway. Aesthetically the film was well shot 80 percent of the time. Sequences of vast mountain ranges and lush green forests silhouettes of the main characters superimposed on a beautiful sunset... all lovely. But the CGI animals? Good Lord they were abysmal! Unintended Biblical reference by the way. The animals' heads moved side to side at the same time as if they were robots and the scene itself only lasted a few seconds. I believe we spent more time watching Emma Watson and her friend stripping down for some... you know what no nudity shown by the way. They were 'doing it' only about 10 feet away from Noah's grandfather which is as creepy as the old man himself. Living in a cave and spending the entire film searching the ground for a berry. What is that about?I hate to disappoint those of you expecting Noah to be a kind nature loving man. Wait... oh no sorry that's exactly what he was for the first half hour until he started killing people. SPOILER COMING UP And at the endish of the film when he went to kill the daughters of Emma yeah that was an actual scene he stopped because All I could see was love. CRINGE ALERT. To be honest I would have preferred it if he had of actually killed them it was that cringeworthy. Or better still if he had of jumped out of the T.V. and turned the film off it was that bad.It wasn't badly acted and the script was reasonable for the normal parts of the film few and far between. The problems for me were that it spent too much time on some sections and not enough on others e.g. the animals about half the film was spent with the camera rocking like a boat which just made me feel seasick and that it was just ludicrous. Fairly poor to be honest.".

The Watchers are originally mentioned in the Book of Enoch an ancient noncanonical book of the Jewish religion. The Watchers are as stated in the movie fallen angels but after that the production team took their creative license. Since it is in neither the Jewish Tanakh nor the Christian Bible most viewers will think that the producers simply made up the Watchers.Also there are many gruesome and gutwrenching scenes for this movie reveals just how corrupt Mankind had become. There is no happy parade of animals arriving twobytwo and Noah is not a happy old man with a long flowing beard In this film Noah tries to follow exactly what the Creator commanded of him taking himself past his breaking point.

At first you are like okay okay so they are giving a dramatic interpretation I will let this slide this attitude I kept up until the following things occurred A A psychopathic Noah is God? inspired to protect God's creation from man translation he is willing to kill anyone anyone includes the people on the arkyes his family who gives mankind a surviving chance after the flood. The movie does TRY to touch on God's mercy but God's mercy is not even a thing to notice when the characters are either crying out to God to listen to them or talking about being forsaken. B Darren Aronofsky forsakes basic biblical information such as all of Noah's sons having wives but Aronofsky gives only one of Noah's sons a wife while the rest don't have time to fetch some before the flood strikes which abandoned another aspect that this movie was trying to put across before contradicting that too God will provide. This is literally the weirdest movie adaptation I have ever laid eyes on. It is not a 'blasphemy' it's just plain ludicrous. This movie is true to its real meaning There Is No God.".

	schema:reviewBody "It truly breaks my heart that this movie is so polarizing and that the opinions I so deeply disagree with are those of people who claim to be a part my own faith. For those who are reading their comments please look at them with grace and understand that they are raising their VIEW of the Noah account above the beauty that this movie portrays. You will notice their arguments are usually the same Noah was not dark this is a movie about environmentalism there were no rock creatures God was not silent...All of this is under girded by a belief that they must warn people against this movie. So to offset what is a perceived as the opinion of the Christian community here are several reasons why I believe this movie is beautiful. 1 Man went horribly wrong and dominated the world rather than living in harmony with it. This movie captures their depravity so well that there was no regard for other humans or creation.2 Noah was not chosen because he was righteous but his righteousness was given to him by God. Noah was not God he was fallen and subject to his own sins fleshed out later in the movie. But he obeyed God. His obedience before the ark was his care for creation. Then his obedience in building the ark. Followed by blessing man to be fruitful and multiply.3 Creation was perfect but then subjected to the curse. Noah was the exception to those who objectified creation and abused it. You can toil with nature and work with it without exploiting it.4 God was communicative. He communicated himself in many different ways. At the beginning of the movie He communicated himself as Creator then Judge then Merciful Savior of Creation. 5 It takes an understanding of the Trinity and of the Kingdom to understand that God is using man to care for the world. Creation is groaning but will be restored and will eventually be renewed. There are men and women of the Kingdom who get that who are being restored by Jesus and through that desire to care well for this world.6 What was judgment for many was salvation for a few. The same waters that destroyed mankind also saved Noah and his family. Aronofsky beautifully displayed the difference between a judgment of fire and a judgment of water. This same baptism points to the salvation offered by Jesus. So please. Do not lump all Christians into the same basket and think that they cannot find truth or beauty in this work. Aronofsky brings about beautiful truths in Tree of Life and The Fountain and builds on them with this gem. And to understand more about Jesus Creation and the renewal of all things you should read the book of Colossians in the Bible.".

	schema:headline " Peter Jackson Meets Peter Watkins Meets James Lovelock";
	schema:reviewBody "I was really looking forward to this for one reason and one reason only . The director Darren Aronofsky is just about the most interesting director working today . He doesn't always hit the bullseye but he did direct REQUIEM FOR A DREAM one of the very few films I would describe as a masterpiece and he really upset an uninformed audience who went in to BLACK SWAN thinking it was going to be a high brow film featuring ballet as its theme . Indeed the only time I've seen audience members walk out in obvious disgust was during a screening of BLACK SWAN . With a title like NOAH one wondered Aronofsky might have the same effect on Christians . This is a film that promised to be controversial and as soon as preview audiences saw it there was a very sharp divide between love and hate . Interesting that it had an average rating of 8.8 then quickly started falling as people on this site gave it bad reviews . One can't help thinking there's a campaign by religious believers who seem angry at this film because it deviates from scripture . As an antitheist my only reservations before seeing it were that the trailers looked like it was inspired by Peter Jackson's version of Tolkien The bad news is that we've got Peter Jackson meets Peter Watkins meets Professor James Lovelock . NOAH is a heavily religious film as you might expect but not in the way you're expecting . From the outset we're told that the tribe of Cain have built  industrial cities  and it's this that has brought  the wrath of the creator  . It's not the religion of the Abrahamic cult but the cult of environmentalism and Gaia theory . The subtext is so obvious that it doesn't qualify as subtext because it's far too blatant . Noah and his family are all vegetarians who don't eat meat while the villain TubalCain does because .... well he's the bad guy . Actually this is the major failing of the film . There's no one to root for because the screenplay is an absolute mess . Tubal Cain shows signs of Darwinian practicalities by eating animals in order to survive but there's no real in depth psychological analysis to the character . He wants the Ark because the story needs a villain and is so overdone you're surprised why the other characters can't see through him . . Noah isn't any better because he's an animal loving psychotic misanthrope . Can you think of any obvious society full of nature loving animal loving psychotic misanthropes ? I'll give you a clue . It was a Central European country built on NeoPagan ideals that used an ancient Sanskrit symbol and lasted from 1933 to 1945 . People should stop to consider who they should adopt as role models and when people treat environmentalism as a religion bad things will surely happen but we're ordered to take the side of environmentalism and not to question it In the hands of a lesser director NOAH would have sunk at the box office but thankfully we are talking about Aronofsky . And the good news he's reigned in some the excesses that made me hate THE FOUNTAIN . Yes it owes a lot to Peter Jackson but Aronofsky recognises the strengths of Jackson when he made the LOTR trilogy . We see beautiful locations that captures the bleak brutal beauty of nature throughout the film and some of the cinematography is genuinely stunning . The cast are rather uneven which is hardly surprising considering the screenplay and an audience will find their performances divisive  none more so in Crowe . Connelly is rather bland  Winstone is rather one note and is ...well Ray Winstone .love him or loathe him . By far the best performance is by Emma Watson as Ila who might have been a mere cypher or plot device and yet manages to flesh out her role without being showy in any way .In summary NOAH might just fall in to a flawed masterpiece interesting failure  camp . It's an extraordinarily beautiful looking film that I'll buy on DVD and one hopes it'll be up for Best Director  cinematography and score when the Oscars come around but since it's been released in the Spring the studio don't seem to have much  Pardon the pun  faith in it and it'll be quickly forgotten . While the visuals deliver it does have a very sententious  sombre confusing screenplay that feels the need to both shout at and talk down to the audience . Whatever the flaws of this film it still showcases the talents of Aronofsky and here's to the future and whatever it brings".

I understand how it's pretty stupid but it still manages to entertain the viewer as well build a great amount of suspense in the 3rd act. Also props to Russell Crowe and Emma Watson for delivering great performance. Everyone else... Meh! The story is about Noah and how he is shown by god that a flood would be arriving soon due to how badly humankind has evolved. Noah and his family then go and visit Methuselahplayed wonderfully by Anthony Hopkins who gives Noah his insight to building an ark. On the way Noah finds Ila who is injured badly and is unable to conceive. From there his family takes care of her and one of Noah's sons falls in love with her. 15 or so years later when Noah has almost finished building the ark a king comes and threatens him. Then the flood hits and chaos ensues with a great 3rd act and a suspenseful battle. The animals in the film looked quite unrealistic but the scene where the flood hits is outstanding and awesome. You are also introduced to these rock transformers who look cool but awfully unnecessary for a biblical film. There is also a great battle which includes them in it. The film is also enjoyable but quite slow in parts. The story is very nice and entertaining but has trouble in the 1st act by being way too slow. The 3rd act was awesome though. The script is pretty clichd and stupid but if you endure these things you can have a good time with this film. The acting is also good but I still think that Logan Lerman is forced and too shy but he was good in the 1st Percy Jackson film. in this he didn't suit the role".

	schema:headline " A Refreshing Film Based On Noah's Ark";
	schema:reviewBody "Noah is a Biblicalinspired film based on the story of Noah's Ark.It stars Russell Crowe as Noah along with Jennifer Connelly Ray Winstone Emma Watson and Anthony Hopkins.It was written and directed by Darren Aronofsky.The story about a righteous man that he is singled out by God to save innocent life so the evil and corrupt can perish in a disastrous flood that will cover the earth.Encouraged by his grandfather MethuselahNoah begins building an ark that will contain two of every beast and plant as well as his family.His wife Naameh supports her husband and so does his two sonsShem and Japheth.But his other son Ham isn't so sure due to the fact that he lacks a spouse similar unlike Shemwho has Ila. As birds reptiles and then mammals enter the ark humans gather nearby anxious for their own boarding passes. But they were tried to be stopped by an evil king Tubalcain and his peoplewhose wickedness God intends stop.But once the waters rise Noah faces new challenges.Among them is that he finds out that Ila is is pregnant and no longer barren and whether Noah wants to end humanity or not when they enter the new world.There was definitely a lot of creative license taken in retelling the story of Noah that some Christian may find confusing or absurd.Neverthelessthe recreation of the Old Testament story is definitely an epic.Some may find the changes in the story outlandish but others may find it a great way of updating this timeless tale into the 21st century audience.We get to see how the story of Noah is told on a human scale and deeply explore the personalities involved in the story.Give credit to the cast for their great acting particularly Russell Crowewho does a magnificent job as Noah together with his costars like Jennifer Connellywho plays his troubled wifeNaameh and Emma Watsonwho plays the complex Ila.There was great visuals in the movie especially from narration of Creation and the Great Flood itself.It was definitely a great visual extravaganza.It also presents challenges especially to some audience especially what they want to do if they find themselves in place of Noah's shoes as to whether to end humanity or not.The tension in their family particularly between Noah and his sons as well as Noah and his wifeNaameh about what the Creator wanted him to do emphasizes that.Atheists may fully appreciate this film especially when the theory of evolution is somewhat put in place when the story of Creation was being narrated and God is somewhat not a main character in the movie.But for Christians who want more about the moralphilosophical and theological implications of the story of Noah based on their religious beliefsone may find it disappointing.NeverthelessI would consider this film entertaining and fun to watch with an open mind and isn't looking to refresh Noah's story based from what is written in the Bible.".

	onyx:emotionText "Noah is a Biblicalinspired film based on the story of Noah's Ark.It stars Russell Crowe as Noah along with Jennifer Connelly Ray Winstone Emma Watson and Anthony Hopkins.It was written and directed by Darren Aronofsky.The story about a righteous man that he is singled out by God to save innocent life so the evil and corrupt can perish in a disastrous flood that will cover the earth.Encouraged by his grandfather MethuselahNoah begins building an ark that will contain two of every beast and plant as well as his family.His wife Naameh supports her husband and so does his two sonsShem and Japheth.But his other son Ham isn't so sure due to the fact that he lacks a spouse similar unlike Shemwho has Ila. As birds reptiles and then mammals enter the ark humans gather nearby anxious for their own boarding passes. But they were tried to be stopped by an evil king Tubalcain and his peoplewhose wickedness God intends stop.But once the waters rise Noah faces new challenges.Among them is that he finds out that Ila is is pregnant and no longer barren and whether Noah wants to end humanity or not when they enter the new world.There was definitely a lot of creative license taken in retelling the story of Noah that some Christian may find confusing or absurd.Neverthelessthe recreation of the Old Testament story is definitely an epic.Some may find the changes in the story outlandish but others may find it a great way of updating this timeless tale into the 21st century audience.We get to see how the story of Noah is told on a human scale and deeply explore the personalities involved in the story.Give credit to the cast for their great acting particularly Russell Crowewho does a magnificent job as Noah together with his costars like Jennifer Connellywho plays his troubled wifeNaameh and Emma Watsonwho plays the complex Ila.There was great visuals in the movie especially from narration of Creation and the Great Flood itself.It was definitely a great visual extravaganza.It also presents challenges especially to some audience especially what they want to do if they find themselves in place of Noah's shoes as to whether to end humanity or not.The tension in their family particularly between Noah and his sons as well as Noah and his wifeNaameh about what the Creator wanted him to do emphasizes that.Atheists may fully appreciate this film especially when the theory of evolution is somewhat put in place when the story of Creation was being narrated and God is somewhat not a main character in the movie.But for Christians who want more about the moralphilosophical and theological implications of the story of Noah based on their religious beliefsone may find it disappointing.NeverthelessI would consider this film entertaining and fun to watch with an open mind and isn't looking to refresh Noah's story based from what is written in the Bible.";

Anyway if you are at all philosophically inclined and don't mind movies that make you think about serious and even existential questions ignore the haters Go see Noah!I haven't been so emotionally moved and intellectually stimulated from a movie for quite a while. It's not for the weak of heart. After all it's a story about genocide. But it is beautifully made. And in my opinion stays true to the Biblical account.".

The visuals are out of this world particularly one scene depicting the creation of the universe from the big bang to a scientifically accurate representation of what Darwinian evolution would look like sped up about a million times the whole scene would feel right at home in an episode of Cosmos. Yes you read that right. Special mention must be made to Russel Crowe who delivers the complicated picture of a man that both saves the world but is also supposed to let it die and all of the weight one must feel about it. I can't praise this movie enough it's basically perfect if you are even the least bit curious about going do so! You won't regret it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I cannot believe this movie has a rating of 6.5. I gave it a one because that's the lowest you can enter. A zero would be more appropriate. Worst adaptation of a biblical story ever. The only thing thing the screenwriter had correct was that Noah had a wife and 3 sons there was an Ark built and there was a flood. The following might be interpreted as a spoiler and that is why I checked the box but honestly nothing could spoil this movie it is already a rotting corpse. You have rock people possibly fallen angels but it is not really clear helping Noah build the ark and defend the ark. Nowhere does God ever talk to Noah. He just has some weird dreams that he misinterprets as being from God. One of these misinterpretations is that God wants everyone dead even his own family. Then I am trying to figure out how Noah is going to build a rowboat much less an Ark because the whole world is desolate having been ravaged by evil men. Then enters grandpa Methuselah with a magic bean left over from the Garden of Eden. Are you serious? Wait it gets worse. This magic bean doesn't need overnight to grow you get a whole oldgrowth forest in less than a minute. No water required because it creates its own river. As if it couldn't get any worse you have the villain who killed Noah's father who hacks his way through the wall of the Ark to become a stowaway. You have a raging flood and some guy hacks through the Ark and the Ark takes on no water. Maybe they were magic selfsealing timbers. Anyway Noah's son and the stowaway are hiding down with the animals eating the animals! Later he plots with Noah's son to murder him while at the same time Noah is plotting to kill his grandchildren. If they had put any of this crazy stuff in the previews they might not have half the ticket sales. Based on the previews I thought it could be a good movie. Whoever wrote the screenplay had to be on some kind of drug. For the first time I felt like I should ask for a refund on my ticket.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me make clear I don't care about any of the controversy. I don't care if you want to sit in front of me and trash talk the historical accuracy the biblical aspects or how much you hate Jesus and therefore this movie inevitably sucks. As one professional reviewer pointed out controversy aside this is a good time at the movies! From the first trailer I was excited and my expectations only grew. I knew the potential for it being some bizarre antiChristian piece was high but I was willing to try it and excited to do so. Simply put...wow...my expectations were met and exceeded and this is now the best film I have seen thus far in 2014. I am not fan of blatant CGI and I thought Noah used it nearbrilliantly. The entire animal kingdom was CGI but it was so blatantly awful that you scoffed at it. Noah's heart and soul comes from its unique and liberal perspective of the story. I have great respect for them for looking at the tradition Christian story and saying there are issues there but here is how this could have happened. They incorporated brilliant religious symbolism and characters gave Noah a diverse character with incredible depth an edge of your seat story of politics and the world as they know it. No one knows what the world was like then...no one. We have snippets and conjecture and this is by far the most brilliant rendition of that time. They liberally create animals that may have been or the giants that the bible speaks of and the barren nearly steam punk world that exists around them. I was floored.I have always enjoyed Russell Crowe though I felt like he has hit some major speed bumps in his career. This role was perfect for him and he absolutely nailed it. He is dark brooding full of faith and love for his family. He is driven and disgusted with the world and the scenes of his fighting with his faith are just gut wrenching and brilliant. Crowe is superb. Jennifer Connelly was good in her role as Noah's wife. Their chemistry is terrific but I felt like perhaps her character is very much in the background and doesn't get a lot of chance to shine. She has some good scenes but her performance lacks some of the power of the others in the film. Anthony Hopkins was terrific in a much more subtle way as Methuselah. Hopkins captures an undeniable strength and wisdom to his character. His scenes are immediately captivating and he doesn't really have that many but they are so important and so well performed. Also I also want to address the many apparently slow IMDb forum trolls who were wondering about Hopkin's character performing magic. He was performing miracles via the creator as his faith was as strong as anyones. Emma Watson Logan Lerman and Douglas Booth were all very good as Noah's children. They each have a scene or more that was truly terrific and their chemistry together was really good as it was with Crowe as well. Ray Winstone was very good in his role...however...he was also the one major flaw in the film. He was used as the big villain and I think his character was unnecessary and the story of him getting inside the ark was unnecessary clumsy and pointless. It was literally the one thing that made me feel like this was a 9 and not a 10 for me. I liked Winstone he did a perfectly solid job in the role but the character was unnecessary.I am not a Darren Aronofsky fan. I thought Black Swan was terrible The Fountain was just way out there and The Wrestler was average. Well he has won me over with this because what he has created here is cinema masterpiece. The cinematography the use of CGI the world he creates. This is the key. You feel completely immersed in this world that we know nothing about. This isn't even truly a disaster film. This is a film about faith love family God and yes there is some blatant messages about the direction of the world we live in now. This is the type of film for me that I can and will watch over and over again and get something different from it notice something more or different or take something away from it. I cannot figure out why Christians would be angry and boycott this. This is easily the best example of Old Testament world ever created. It does take some liberties because it has to but there isn't anything here to squash the Christian faith or the traditional story. I absolutely LOVED the fallen angel giants Nephilim for those of you wanting to look more into it. Was the film completely scriptural? NO. But they also didn't ignore it and embraced the concepts. Visually stunning brilliantly acted and just an incredible experience. It won't get the accolades it deserves as far as I'm concerned. 9.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I did watch this film in it's premiere in Athens at the festival of Franchophone films.I liked the movie which incorporated many surreal and fantasy elements in the linear narrative of the life of the hero. He had an alter ego which was the substantiation of a childhood fantasy which always tried to tempt him to follow the broad path that led to riches fame sex and power. He followed the advice of his evil other self and he became the public icon we know from history and the media. Emphasis is also given to his Jewishness and his courage to manifest it before collaborationist authorities as a young boy.Excepting the marked surreal elements which the director in an introductory speech attributed to the fact that he is also a comic strip creator the film emphasizes what we already know that is his incessant womanizing publicity seeking and studied provocative stance culminating in his memorable if controversial rendering of the Marselleisethe French national anthemin a reggae music version and a refrain that was full of irony. The sometimes overemphasized description of his rampant sexuality drove some of the audience out of the theatre as did the depiction of his reggae version of the French national anthem. But this was obviously an overreaction due either to ignorance or desire to cut a figure. If you had the slightest idea of who Gainsbourgh was you would not be expecting anything else from a movie dedicated to his life story.Because Gainsbough was prone to the pleasures of the flesh with women famous or ordinary many impressive actresses such as Laetitia Casta and Anna Muglalis appear in the movie portraying the gorgeous women he had affairs with. The whole impression you form is that he had been a antiauthoritarian bobobourgeoisBoheme before this term had been invented.There is also a sensitive depiction of his relationship with his parents which was closer and more intimate than one would expect from a man who had such an obvious real or affected grudge towards authority.The actresses play convincingly the women of his life who were glamorous and sexy. In the end one is left with the question whether such a life is enviable and worthy of emulation or example to avoid. whichever answer each one reaches as a spectacle it is surely interesting to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lucien 'Serge Gainsbourg' Ginsburg. Artist. Writer. Performer. Alcoholic. Smoker. Rebel. Womanizer. Genius? Joann Sfar's film documents the sporadic lifestyle of the famous French artist Serge Gainsbourg Eric Elmosnino whose life contained no boundaries no objects off limit and continually tested the patience of those huddled together around him. Beginning with a young Gainsbourg developing his taste for painting aspiring models in NaziOccupied France as a mere teenager the film thereupon concentrates primarily upon his relationships with various beautiful women and his life choices in regards to his everchanging occupation over his sixtyyearlifespan.What makes this film work so well as a biopic is the truly ingenious performances by both Kacey Mottet Klein Young Gainsbourg and Eric Elmosnino Adult Gainsbourg who both somewhat beautifully represent such a tragic figure throughout his whole onscreen lifetime. Kacey portrays Gainsbourg as a boy who is maturing faster than those other children around him so far so that he explains to one of the schoolchildren the reason that he is good at drawing pubic hairs is because he has had an upclose and personal experience with them before. While he is also shown to be a lonely child an outcast as Jewish child growing up in NaziOccupied France and thus he develops an affable 'imaginary friend' to keep himself company. Born as small soft head that watches over young Gainsbourg as he sleeps in the woods to avoid the Nazi soldiers his only friend soon becomes his worst enemy as he matures into a complicated man. His once pleasant 'imaginary friend' is now a grotesque being with a large nose longthin fingers and an affection for cigarettes and bullying Gainsbourg. He continually berates insults prods and engages Serge providing the viewpoint that he himself was his harshest critic and a critic he could not simply dismiss without entire control over his life.Aside from the performances the way Sfar allows the films narrative to flow in a temporal manner with no mention of time or calendar dates further draws the audience in to Gainsbourg's contrived world. The only way to tell when an event shifts forward in his lifetime is through his own physical deterioration from old age which is heavily dictated by his excessive abuse of alcohol and tobacco. But as Gainsbourg becomes older his sexual conquests stay the same age from Elisabeth Deborah Grall to Jane the late Lucy Gordon and to an affair with the insatiable Brigitte Bardot Laetitia Casta before he eventually settles down with Bambou Mylene Jampanoi who would be his final partner. These are all young vulnerable women who Gainsbourg exploits for his own sexual misgivings and once they become too old or too boring he discards them like a child throwing away an old toy to badger his parents for a new more expensive model.Joann Sfar beautifully flowing biopic paints Serge Gainsbourg as a shallow misogynistic grumpy old man who once had dreams of becoming famous for doing anything but once those dreams were realised greed and narcissism triumphed over his once forgotten ambitions. Utilizing his gift for writing artistry and music Gainsbourg chose the route of controversy and scandal over that of happiness and family which is exemplified in his response to the media after he had a heart attack. When the reporters asked what he will be doing now after such a dangerous and life threatening operation Gainsbourg calmly asserted to those in attendance that he will continue to smoke many more cigarettes and drink much more alcohol.".

	schema:headline " I liked the reference to postwar cultural development";
	schema:reviewBody " Might contain spoilers  I personally found the portrayal of decay one of the most impressive features in the movie. The character's fall naturally depicts the transition of the hautecouture from the waryears which was yet a reminiscence of Golden Era yet with a little less social exclusion towards the chaotic and disturbing culture the rebuilding process in the postwar years.You can see it first in the transition of the protagonist's manners which change from subliminally provocative in childhood towards openly ironic during the time spent with Brigitte Bardot  every attempt to remain sincere and ernst during this time must have been felt as a facre   towards unreflected vulgar antieverything proclamations you see in the remake of the sexdriven song and the years after.Also you can see it in the changing clothing which slowly progresses and finally finds its point of no return when Gainsborg finds his British wife. First of all it's the international coupling which of course introduces compromises on all sides and which also makes him send away his visage which is basically a symbol of his genius overall. What he sends away is the normed cultural knowledge he gained as an aspiring French intellectual. Accepting to embrace the then more international culture he becomes basically a perverse antihero which resembles the Proustian portray of Bloch. While he learns and transcends the interdisciplinary approach towards the new culture he becomes a tornapart individual and ultimately an outsider for both the French and the British society in which he lives becoming truly an international cultural outlaw. The first hint at his outlaw status is the rejection of his song written for Brigitte So his clothes change towards what you would think a typical drugaddicted rocknroll star outfit and has not the slightest scent of culture and style left. He resembles a little bit the latest pictures found on Dylan.But most interestingly is the attempt to relate this final breakdown with the his experience of WW2 something that is dominantly present in the scenes where he performs the Marseillese. You see that subconsciously he still is haunted by his past and while his embracement of earlier hautecouture allowed him to feel at home and at peace somehow with his country and intellectual background the emergence of a new form of pop culture  loud clubs where electronic music is played an Asian looking girl friend a ton of Garbage art on his estate  you can see that this last piece of hope and divinity which he found in the art of chanson writing falls apart and leaves him with nothing left than ruins.The entire biopic hence deals somehow with the cultural breakdown of the entire society due to the rebuilding process of postwar Europe and the massive dilution of cultural products across borders and the end of selfconsciousness it introduces with itself.The last dignity initially spared by the war experience and conserved in the intellectual networks of Paris vanishes. And even worse he probably experienced to have contributed to this mess. When the Asian looking girl comes straight to the point asking if he wanted to fuck her while he was still trying to frame his intentions more elaborately as a gentleman he must have ultimately realized that everything was over. He was not even part of the outlaw movement anymore. He was just some random individual that was perceived as following its most primal instincts. At that point he say NO. Don't you dare to leave. Another point of no return.Yes because there he was. An alcoholic postintellectual and vulgar individual. What was left to do but to escape everything and forget about what he once deemed important by making another baby and becoming a family man after all. The rage and violence have vanished in the final scenes simply because anything that he could rage about was dead.Apart from that as already mentioned the film was catchy atmospheric and somewhat epic.".

He resembles a little bit the latest pictures found on Dylan.But most interestingly is the attempt to relate this final breakdown with the his experience of WW2 something that is dominantly present in the scenes where he performs the Marseillese. You see that subconsciously he still is haunted by his past and while his embracement of earlier hautecouture allowed him to feel at home and at peace somehow with his country and intellectual background the emergence of a new form of pop culture  loud clubs where electronic music is played an Asian looking girl friend a ton of Garbage art on his estate  you can see that this last piece of hope and divinity which he found in the art of chanson writing falls apart and leaves him with nothing left than ruins.The entire biopic hence deals somehow with the cultural breakdown of the entire society due to the rebuilding process of postwar Europe and the massive dilution of cultural products across borders and the end of selfconsciousness it introduces with itself.The last dignity initially spared by the war experience and conserved in the intellectual networks of Paris vanishes. And even worse he probably experienced to have contributed to this mess. When the Asian looking girl comes straight to the point asking if he wanted to fuck her while he was still trying to frame his intentions more elaborately as a gentleman he must have ultimately realized that everything was over. He was not even part of the outlaw movement anymore. He was just some random individual that was perceived as following its most primal instincts. At that point he say NO. Don't you dare to leave. Another point of no return.Yes because there he was. An alcoholic postintellectual and vulgar individual. What was left to do but to escape everything and forget about what he once deemed important by making another baby and becoming a family man after all. The rage and violence have vanished in the final scenes simply because anything that he could rage about was dead.Apart from that as already mentioned the film was catchy atmospheric and somewhat epic.";

Sfar's film has depicted them both. More the presence of the phantasms and loud spoken dialogs with his inner him  La Gueule points at the will to make this movie a bit different from a simple telling of a biography assuming that a large number already knows it. But still I'd like to say that it is not enough to make this film a real masterpiece. The linearity is a little bit boring and after the first half of the movie has been seen you might want to check your watch. This is an unstoppable rolling towards the end the only limit of the man  the end. But cinema has such wonderful possibilities to play with reality and even time so why could we not have a little bit more interesting way of telling this exciting story? This makes the movie a bit plain even with such wonderful and detailed work on visual elements.The music? I guess it is inutile to say what kind and whose music we hear in the film.

The easiest answer at hand was the wikipedia entry which tells us that Sfar is a well known comics author in the fabulous FrenchBelgian tradition. He is of Jewish origin and his next film is an adaptation of one of his comics successes called The Rabbi's Cat.And suddenly all makes sense. The opening scenes of the film contain the key of the biography of French musician and poet Serge Gainsbourg as imagined by Sfar. We see Lucien Ginzburg a Jewish kid in occupied Paris during WWII daring not only to laugh in fronde at the nose of the collaborationist police by being the first in line to receive his yellow Star of David as a sign of nobility rather than an anathema but moreover to transform in his mind and his sketch drawings the fat rapacious Jew on the Vichy posters in the thin stylish long nose and big years Gueule  the alterego who will guide his steps and feed his revenging selfconfidence for the rest of his life.The combination of acting and cartoon is not a new thing but it has never been tried before in a biopic to the best of my knowledge. Sure it is not the usual respectful biopic but it's the vision of Sfar about Ginzburg  Gainsbourg and Sfar he says in the final text before the credits was more interested about Gainsbourg lies than by his perceived truths. Moreover for sure Gainsbourg himself would not have appreciated a respectful film. Ironically undertitled 'Vie heroique' heroic life the film takes us though the artistic and especially womanizing career of Gainsbourg from the early 50s to the late 70s. We see him in the company of such French cultural icon as Boris Vian and especially of fabulous women such as Juliette Greco Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin and actually the list in the film is very partial. I enjoyed each of the scenes in this part of the film which combine style attention to details just follow how fashion changes marking the progress of time and deep understanding of the atmosphere of the Parisian clubs and artistic milieu in the mythic mid20 century. His Gueule alterego mentors him though this trip and when he decides to renounce his patronizing it's the beginning of the end  the charisma goes away and the effects of his excesses slowly destroy him. Maybe a little more of his art would have provided an even more complex and balanced image of the person that Gainsbourg was  this would be my only observation.The choice of Eric Elmosnino as Gainsbourg is excellent he drives the character from the insecurity of the young age to the decay of the end all the time with charm and deep empathy. He proves a perfect understanding of the intentions of the director and a full identification with the identity dilemmas of the FrenchJewish Gainsbourg. Laetitia Casta is a perfect replica of Bardot. Lucy Gordon is mastering very well Jane Birkin's role. Her maturity makes even harder to explain the suicide of the young actress a few days before the film was presented in avantpremiere at Cannes.".

That his life spanned the Nazi occupation to the rise of Disco would stretch credibility if this were fiction but as it's all more or less true the director who is already an accomplished graphic artist manages to lift it to the level of slightly absurd fiction. Mixing in animation selfconsciously stagey sets and a lifesized puppet as Gainsbourg's dreaded alter ego.Even the sordid lowlife is given the big treatment and the early days in the garret look unashamedly glamorous as they would if reimagined for an opera set or a Salvador Dali dream sequence as director Joann Sfar lays it on with a trowel. The episodic nature of the story gives it a rather patchy feel though and I couldn't help thinking that one or two episodes especially the cute Hollywoodstyle musical scene with Brigitte Bardot could have been shorter. Bardot was just one of the highprofile women Gainsbourg captured and so was the muse of the existentialists Juliette Greco.The casting is pretty uncanny with the possible exception of Greco who was never that modelthin. Gainsbourg has always been at least outside France more famous for being cool than for his music. But his reworking of La Marseillaise which so upset the rightwing patriots of the Seventies was nothing but excellent. I'll go back just to hear that Sly and Robbie riddim one more time.Quite a substantial feast but it's worth building up an appetite in advance. And of course you get Jane Birkin and... That Song.".

	schema:headline " The Life of a Man Who Did Live...";
	schema:reviewBody "'Gainsbourg' is both a natural history of the man portrayed and the idea of the man. The brilliant use of creature effects in the makeup of Doug Jones  'Pan' from 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a multilayered touch not enforcing an opinion of Serge upon the audience as such a trick might but illustrating several things Gainsbourg triumphed over. All of these were his self. He embraced and made his own the negative and positive appraisals people made of him could deflect his enemies as well as magnetise friends and lovers. There were many lovers.Bardot is present and accounted for and her portrayal here does little to shift the notion that she was a muse for artists who lusted after her rather than be a truly great artist herself.

	onyx:emotionText "'Gainsbourg' is both a natural history of the man portrayed and the idea of the man. The brilliant use of creature effects in the makeup of Doug Jones  'Pan' from 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a multilayered touch not enforcing an opinion of Serge upon the audience as such a trick might but illustrating several things Gainsbourg triumphed over. All of these were his self. He embraced and made his own the negative and positive appraisals people made of him could deflect his enemies as well as magnetise friends and lovers. There were many lovers.Bardot is present and accounted for and her portrayal here does little to shift the notion that she was a muse for artists who lusted after her rather than be a truly great artist herself.

	schema:reviewBody "There was probably a good few hundred reasons to fail that movie about the life of the most famous french song writer but I was happy to find out the director didn't fall in any of these traps. This movie was poetic touching elegant and engaging. Retracing Lucien Ginsburg's life with style and a touch of romanticism the two hours unfolded so quickly that I was almost surprised when the credits started to roll. From his childhood in Nazi occupied Paris to his encounters with Boris Vian or Les Freres Jacques from his rise to success with Bardot or Jane Birkin the story marks all the important moments in the life of this unforgettable composer that has left many generations dazzled by his craftsmanship.Eric Elmosnino is simply gigantic in this role conjuring all the greatness of Serge Gainsbourg letting us get a glimpse of its never seen before talent as well as his fragility. The staging of an alter ego representing his genie pushing and pulling him to become the man we know is right on the spot to express his inner conflict to choose between painting and music. Music is a minor art the man used to say as he recorded albums upon albums that are still to this day amongst the most compelling creations in french song writing. Many bits of lyrics used throughout the movie are poking the aficionado in the best way possible.Avoiding the traps of linear storytelling as it has to respect chronological events it goes back and forth through time using the protagonist at different periods of his life to put in perspective what goes on in his mind. From young Lucien to l'Homme  Tte de Chou from the fusion of Serge with his genie to become Gainsbarre I spent an exquisite moment in the life of a man whose music and lyrical excellence have touched me as a teenager and still remain a defining influence in my life. No need to say the music is beautifully embedded in this graceful biography.The only minor inconvenience I could point out is Laetitia Casta that plays Brigitte Bardot without an ounce of talent but fortunately these scenes are short and quickly forgotten. I recommend this film to anyone that has remotely enjoyed Gainsbourg's artwork at any point in his life for it is an amazing and poetic experience you will not regret. It is brilliantly shot and edited with both rhythm and attention to quiet emotional scenes. It takes you up and down with the protagonist's questioning about the meaning of his life and his descent to hell from which he never came back.

His fame quickly skyrockets as does his appeal to famous ladies of the 1960s Brigitte Bardot a sultry Laetitia Casta the bohemian Juliette Grco Anna Mouglalis fresh from her role as Coco Chanel and the English singeractress Jane Birkin Lucy Gordon who tragically committed suicide before the film's release.At various points in the film Gainsbourg is joined by La Gueule 'The Mug' his alter ego and everything he is not daring debonair devilmaycare. Although I was intrigued by this peculiar gangly figure whose ears are emphasised and whose nose is ridiculously long and aquiline a reference to Ginsberg's insecurity the surrealism of this character seemed to detract from Elmosnino's performance and therefore quickly seemed bathetic. This is Sfar's first stab as a director so he was bound to make dubious judgements. The biggest one was casting Elmosnino as the lead. The part is too big for him. There's a very claustrophobic atmosphere and interiors are generally only partly shown which is perhaps a reflection of Gainsbourg's insularity.When I read about how influential Serge Gainsbourg was how many genres he experimented with and what inspired him to pen and feature in the famously lascivious song 'Je t'aime moi non plus' 'I love you... me neither' I thought I was in for a real treat. Watch this film and you may come away thinking the man was nothing but a selfeffacing odd looking quasitalented musician who was prone to unexpected blubbering and who was liked bizarrely for those qualities which he himself was insecure about.www.scottishreview.net".

All bohemian lazy sleepy and ennui soaked we get to see how boy Lucien Gainsbourg morphed from butterfly child into Serge the Caterpillar adult with his 'charms' exuding Gallic sex appeal to some very famous pop culture women. His comic book songs are really just bubblegum and the Bonnie Parker song of 1967 is a ridiculous moment in radio junk. I remember these songs from 42 years ago and all this film did was remind me how silly the songs were... like something from a BEACH PARTY drive in movie but with Serge and Brigitte pouting and spouting at each other. The Jane Birkin years are far more interesting but the film slides into maudlin parody of what is becoming a boring indulgent man by the 2 hour mark. Seeing him flopping around a disco is tragic and boring. The use of a puppet as his alter ego is a terrific device. The film is well made and overall a few blips above interesting. The shattering news that actress Lucy Gordon suicided at age 28 casts a really dark heartache over the film. Remember those awful Euro pop songs of the 60s like Blue Blue My love Is Blue... well we are in a bio about a man who wrote songs just a bit better than that. It all just reminds you to see Euro pop flicks like BARBARELLA again. If you go into this willing to float along with it then you will be satisfied.".

The ending was rather abrupt and unsatisfying too.Great performance by Eric Elmosnino in the lead role.

	schema:reviewBody "This 2010 biopicdirected by comic book artist Joann Sfar who wrote the script with Isabel Ribis based on Sfar's graphic novelcame across every bit as messy and undisciplined as its subject's life. Serge Gainsbourg played beautifully by Eric Elmosnino was a French painter and highly successful musician and songwriter of the 1960s and 1970s who is considered a leading if occasionally scandalizing figure in French pop music. Sfar gives Gainsbourg an imaginary alterego La Gueule played in a cartoonish mask by Doug Jones who at first is his cheerleader encouraging him to create and perform but who comes to be a darker force egging on his bad behavior. It's somewhat reminiscent of how Michael Keaton was dogged by his former self in Birdman. Meanwhile Gainsbourg bounces from one love affair to another and in and out of marriage having notable liaisons with Brigitte Bardot Juliette Grco and a tenyear relationship with British actress Jane Birkin. His time is spent at the piano writing songs for his lovers and smoking thousands of cigarettes. The movie credits are charming and undoubtedly reflected the talents and eye of Sfar and the early scenes of the movie about Gainsbourg when he was a precocious young boy before he changed his name from Lucien Ginsburg defiantly wearing his yellow star are charming. But in a rare concession to boredom I abandoned the movie after an hour and a half missing the artist's final downward spiral and his popular reggae period too. Not to mention the heroic of the film's title.".

The mood swings from this is impossible to escape to finally!! they escaped back to OMG!! this is impossible to escape within a few moments.

	schema:headline " Not vintage but still Hawks!";
	schema:reviewBody "'Ceiling Zero' fits quite neatly into the central part of his 'oeuvre'. The classical Hawks' hero is honourable and heroic but flawed. 'Dizzy' Davis fits firmly and squarely into this archetype. His womanising and recklessness precedes him and is the cause on one of the film's twin tragedies. But this is offset by daring and bravery that is 'de rigeur' for mail pilots of the era. It is very rarely in films of this era that the 'hero' could still be the villain with just a few minutes to go but that is effectively the case here. As in many of Hawks' finest films the opening sequence serves as a contrasting miniature morality play that sets the ensuing drama into focus. Here it is a cowardly pilot who lost in poor visibility bails out of his plane without thought for the financial consequences for his employers. It is no accident that the company at the heart of the film is 'Federal Airlines'. Many of Hawks' films make exquisite political allegories and this is no exception. Read the 'fog' as the Great Depression Dizzy as the reckless aspect of the American entrepreneurial spirit and Jake as The President But there is more psychologically it works a treat too. Jake and Dizzy share the same heroic wartime background. It emerges that they share the same taste in women too. To some extent they represent two aspects of the same character  it is significant that during the climactic moments of Texas' final approach to the airfield they keep switching roles with first one then the other taking charge of the situation. Both of them also show the same moral flexibility  Dizzy by exchanging places with Tommy's boyfriend Jake by being willing to distort his professional judgement to save Dizzy's flying career. In spite of all of this 'Ceiling Zero' cannot really be placed at the same level as the truly great Hawks masterpieces  El Dorado To Have  Have Not Bringing Up Baby and significantly Only Angels Have Wings. At the end of the film one doesn't feel that one has really known the characters. But considering its vintage it is an entirely worthy work that gives us clear indications of the wonders to come.It should be absolutely essential viewing for anyone wishing to acquaint themselves with the an important work of one of America's greatest artists in any discipline of the twentieth century. Another interesting parallel is Ford's 'Air Mail'which has a similar story also originating in Frank Wead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ceiling Zero is a story about airmail pilots back when flying was itself an occupational hazard. It was written by Frank W. Wead better known as Spig Wead whose life was later brought to the screen by John Ford in Wings of Eagles.For those who've seen Wings of Eagles they know that Spig Wead was a navy pilot who set all kinds of aviation records before becoming paralyzed with a broken neck due to a fall down some stairs in his home. After that Wead turned to writing and published all kinds of articles stories and screenplays mostly relating to aviation.Ceiling Zero was Wead's one attempt at a Broadway play. It ran for three months on Broadway in 1935 with John Litel and Osgood Perkins in the roles played by James Cagney and Pat O'Brien respectively. It got good critical acclaim but a short Broadway run as did a lot of plays during the Depression. O'Brien is the operations manager of an airline and Cagney is an old friend who is an irresponsible but talented flyer. Superficially those seem like parts tailor made for Cagney and O'Brien but this is in fact a serious drama so their usual hijinks are not present in this film as well they shouldn't have been.Cagney and O'Brien had done another film about aviation Devil Dogs of the Air which is far more lighthearted but which Warner Brothers invested far more production values. For the most part Ceiling Zero is a photographed stage play with some scenes that are clearly done on the backlot. I'm surprised that Wead who did in fact write more for the screen didn't push for a bigger budget and some location shooting for his play. On the plus side Director Howard Hawks handles his cast real well and you can see some influences for the later and better Only Angels Have Wings.".

Jake Dizzy's old WWI flying buddy has gotten him a job at the Newark office as Dizzy is on the verge of losing his pilot's license as he has a bad ticker and a bad attitude when it comes to following all of the new rules that did not exist when he first started out in the business.There are romantic complications too. Touchiest of these is the fact that Jake's wife of two years Mary was serious about Dizzy right before she met Jake. This is information Dizzy and Mary desperately want to keep from Jake in order to spare his feelings. There's also a new female pilot at the Newark branch Tommy all of 19 who catches Dizzy's eye. Tommy has a steady boyfriend but she's fascinated by this older experienced WWI ace and his exciting stories and lifestyle.Dizzy is a fellow on the move with him chasing Tommy and age and the odds chasing him and then there's Mike an old ace Dizzy's age who cracked up in a wreck. His bones healed but his mind didn't and Dizzy is horrified to see his old mirror image turned simpleton and janitor. It's unspoken but you just know that Dizzy sees his own possible future when he looks at the guy.The film is a real edgeofyourseat experience even though almost all of the action is on the ground as pilots fly in ceiling zero weather and some make it back alive and some don't. It's an exciting little movie with a look at the state of flight technology in 1935. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Much better than the critics would have you believe";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was in and out of Atlanta theaters in one weekwhat a shame! It doesn't deserve the short run and bad reviews. All I can say is if you like romantic movies try this one on DVD. Stateside has the kind of sweet story that the critics usually hate. It's refreshingly different from most romances. It avoids the typical formula. You know the one where the girl and guy meet cute fall in love during a musical interlude break up and get back together at the end typically with the guy racing to the airport to catch the girl at the last minute before she boards her plane. Stateside reminded me of movies that I saw back in the sixties like The Graduate. Of course it isn't as good as The Graduate but it has that kind of offbeat quality. Some of the negative reviews focused on minor issues such as the slow start and continuity problems. Others complained that the dialog was too poetic but to me that was a plus not a minus. Still others pointed out how unrealistic this kind romance would be in the real world. But haven't these people ever heard of willing suspension of disbelief? Besides countless romantic stories have derived their drama from the fact that the guy and girl are so different from each other. And unlike most 'opposites attract' movies Stateside doesn't shy away from showing how difficult it would be for these two to have any kind of longterm relationship.These critics apparently missed the point of the movie. It is about a bittersweet romance that would never have happened if not for Dori's mental illness. Both Mark and Dori gave up something important in order to get something they desperately wanted. If Dori had not been mentally ill she would have married some rock star or movie star. She had to give up that dream because now she is lucky to get any guy much less a nice guy like Mark. Mark had to give up a lot too. Before meeting Dori he probably expected to fall in love with an average but mentally stable girl. He gave up that prospect in order to do something he would have previously thought impossiblehave a relationship with a real pinup girl.Jonathan Tucker and Rachel Leigh Cook are outstanding as Mark and Dori especially Cook. She plays such a sweet innocent and guileless beauty that you have no trouble believing that Tucker's character could fall in love with her despite her mental illness. Cook strips away the veneer of civility and gamesmanship that we typically see in Hollywood romances. What she reveals is a very likable character.By the way the story is based on the director's own life. He was a rich kid who fell in love with a mentally ill actress. He did join the marines and was sent to Lebanon.Stateside won't win any academy awards. It has its flaws but it is an enjoyable movie with fine acting and appealing characters. I give it 7.5 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was in and out of Atlanta theaters in one weekwhat a shame! It doesn't deserve the short run and bad reviews. All I can say is if you like romantic movies try this one on DVD. Stateside has the kind of sweet story that the critics usually hate. It's refreshingly different from most romances. It avoids the typical formula. You know the one where the girl and guy meet cute fall in love during a musical interlude break up and get back together at the end typically with the guy racing to the airport to catch the girl at the last minute before she boards her plane. Stateside reminded me of movies that I saw back in the sixties like The Graduate. Of course it isn't as good as The Graduate but it has that kind of offbeat quality. Some of the negative reviews focused on minor issues such as the slow start and continuity problems. Others complained that the dialog was too poetic but to me that was a plus not a minus. Still others pointed out how unrealistic this kind romance would be in the real world. But haven't these people ever heard of willing suspension of disbelief?

	schema:reviewBody "It is said that everyone is able to play one good role themselves. I suppose it can also be said that every screen writer has one good story their own life. That is if they have had an interesting life. As he says in the DVD extras this movie Stateside set in the early 1980s is about 90 accurate based on the writerdirector's own life in the early 1980s. It is a very unconventional love story I enjoyed it however it may not be for everyone's tastes.Mark Jonathan Tucker is a fairly typical rich high school graduate with too much time on his hands he is involved in an incident where a girl riding in his car was badly injured plus Father Conoff Ed Begley Jr. who was in another car. Beer was found in Mark's car in court he was given the choice to join the Marines and all charges would be wiped away after he was honorably discharged. So Stateside is the story of what happened as a result. Paying a visit to the injured girl he quite accidentally meets up with Dori Rachael Leigh Cook who gets hit with an errant drinking fountain stream as she walks by him. Her reaction? Do it again smiling. Dori was an actress and rock band member but a bit skitzoid so she was hospitalized. However Mark took an instant liking to this kookie Dori and she also was fond of him. I have been a fan of Cook's who has mainly played teenage fluff roles but here as the troubled Dori shows that she is much more than a pretty face.The middle of the movie shows us Mark's basic training the tough drill Sergent Skeer Val Kilmer in a very good role gets word that Mark is a rich kid there to avoid jail time so is especially tough on him but Mark takes everything in stride and becomes a good Marine. He eventually gets an assignment to Beirut not Stateside where 20 of his company died.SPOILERS. Mark returns to the States wounded and with only one eye. Dori goes in and out of the hospital. The two of them keep their affection for each other against the odds. Mark apologizes to Father Conoff for the injuries who responds with Go in peace. Joe Mantegna has a good role as Marks' caring father mom had died. In the end Dori seems to be outgrowing her illness appears to be stabilizing she and Mark are destined to be together. I only wish I knew what happened to the real Dori.".

Though it might not appeal to a mass audience of younger teens this movie appeals to people ranging from young adults to babyboomers and genxers who lived through this period. The cast is stellar and the direction seems solid and the camerawork deliberate. The reallife Marine experience of director of Reverge Anselmo brings a sense of realism to the film that is often lacking in pictures about the military  which tend to be heavy with political rhetoric and are often written by people who experience wartime from Berkley CA.This picture is enhanced by a spectacular soundtrack that compliments the film well. It's always a good sign for a film when major actors accept minor roles. Stateside finds Penny Marshall having an uncredited role as a nurse and Carrie Fisher as Mrs. Dubios  a part which is concentrated in mostly one scene. Val Kilmer and Joe Mantegna combine for about 15 minutes of screen time.The reviews for this movie were mixed. However I find it impossible to change the channel when it comes on TV and it's quickly climbing my shortlist of favorite films. Clearly not everyone will like this Stateside. It does have continuity issues and there are some dialogue and plot details that don't make sense until the second or third time you see it. And I agree that the ending is slightly abrupt. However if you're looking for a romantic movie or a hidden gem drama you can do a lot worse with an hour and a half of your life.".

They do a good job of introducing us to the characters both are quite likable.The film picks up when our leads are falling in love. The comedy aspects are funny and the romantic aspects are cute. The film gets dramatic at times. In my opinion too dramatic but the filmmakers had things they wanted to say and I think they wanted to make this a bigger film than just a romantic comedy.The film has a great soundtrack and they got me in a great mood to start the film with Elvis Costello during the opening credits. I recommend Stateside for movie fans who want more to their romantic comedies.".

Mark Jonathan Tucker is a prep school student with a strict father who sends him to the Marines Dori Rachael Leigh Cook is an aspiring musician with a temper and mental problems. They do a good job of introducing us to the characters both are quite likable.The film picks up when our leads are falling in love. The comedy aspects are funny and the romantic aspects are cute. The film gets dramatic at times. In my opinion too dramatic but the filmmakers had things they wanted to say and I think they wanted to make this a bigger film than just a romantic comedy.The film has a great soundtrack and they got me in a great mood to start the film with Elvis Costello during the opening credits. I recommend Stateside for movie fans who want more to their romantic comedies.";

	schema:reviewBody "Oh boy. Where to start? First of all I was mistaken to believe this was a romantic comedy. Stateside is completely void of both romance and comedy. It also seems to be missing a cohesive story and good direction.The story follows a young marine Jonathan Tucker who can't help but fall in love with a mentally ill musician Rachael Leigh Cook. As he spends time with her her recovery begins to slow to the point where he is forced to sever contact. Will love conquer all? Believe me by this point you won't care.I found the story hard to follow as the movie stumbled forward. With a story this simple the audience really shouldn't have to question what is going on and why. And how believable is love at first site in a mental institution? 'Oh Hello. Sorry I squirt water on you from the broken water fountain Will you marry me??' Give me a break.I was shocked to find that this isn't director Reverge Anselmo's first movie. It has 'first time filmmaker' written all over it. The fault can't be put solely on the director though. This is an absolute wreck of a script written by.. oh look Reverge Anselmo. OK all the blame falls on him.There is quite a fine conglomeration of talent gathered for this fiasco Joe Mantegna Val Kilmer Ed Begley Jr Penny Marshall and Carrie Fisher all lend their faces to Stateside. All have small parts and try to lend credibility to the film. Ed Begley Jr did a good job with what he had. Val Kilmer however was very inconsistent. When he is yelling at the recruits he just seemed out of place. He wasn't a believable or natural military leader. However when he slowed down to talk to the boys from his heart he was quite good.Jonathan Tucker does a good job as the lead and Rachael Leigh Cook does a decent job as the mentally ill musicianactress. I just never bought into the relationship.I really wish more time had been spent in the editing room prior to the films release. The story is interesting but the way it unfolds is far too distracting to allow the audience to fall into a comfort zone and accept the story as told. The movie also feels very heavy. It really could have used a bit more humor to offset the dramatic tension caused by the marine's relationship with his father and by his forbidden romance with his famous mentally ill soul mate.".

Rachel Leigh Cook is very beautiful and charming and it is her best performance among the many films of her filmography that I have seen. The nasty and expendable part of the plot is the training of the Marines with offensive words and prejudice against Arabs and communists making easy to understand the images we frequently see on TV of the abuses mainly against Iraqi prisoners.

By then I'm Hooked so any movie I can't Rent or Borrow from the Library I'll buy on Half.com just to see everything she ever played. Rachael was adorable in Sally but where I thought that was the epitome of understanding Mental Illness  this movie jumps Far Beyond into the world of a Talented SingerActress slipping into Schizophrenia.The first few scenes are a bit confusing as we are introduced to the Characters and set up the situation. But by the time the two young lovers meet we are ready for the Love Affair of the Century. Can True Love survive years of separation and Mental Illness? Can Imperfect Human Beings Love each other just as they are? Can people sacrifice their own gratification for the good of one they Love? If this filmed earned an R Rating it is more for the Sexually Explicit Language than it's Nudity or Situations. The blunt talk is realistic for characters of this age. Overall this is a very Moral Film about Love and Redemption. It left me More in Love with Rachael Leigh Cook and More Romantic about Love!".

	schema:reviewBody "After a disastrous and very short run theatrical release Stateside has been playing regularly on cable for over a year. Playing regularly is somewhat of an understatement as those with a digital cable package can pretty much find it on some channel any day and anytime. Fortunately the film is ideal for piecemeal viewing watching a scene here and a scene there not necessarily in sequence until you realize you have seen the whole thing because it is nicely written and is actually more coherent and entertaining when viewed in little snippets. This is a nice way of saying the film lacks unity and that the whole is less than the sum of its parts. But the parts themselves are well worth viewing.What you have here is an unorganized mix of disparate elements each typically used by themselves to carry a movie. Start with the standard Freddie Bartholomew Captains Courageous Lord Jeff etc. rich kid from a neglectful home add a bit of reckless prep school teen drinking which injures a Priest Cruel Intentions plus a boot camp coming of age story Full Metal Jacket for your love interest insert a female rock star and actress with mental problems Francis and Girl Interrupted and then a return from the war as a disabled veteran The Best Years of Our Lives. Although Stateside doesn't work as a whole package and sets the alltime record for credibility problems there is still a lot of entertaining stuff here. Jonathan Tucker is appealing in the lead role and actually brings some credibility to a character going through enough life changes for ten movies. Rachel Leigh Cook basically does her Ruthie character from The Big Empty who I suspect is pretty much her real life self. Her Dori character is supposed to suffer from schizophrenia but if you don't know what that is going into the film you won't understand it any better after viewing. Apparently the writer thinks anyone who is irreverent impulsive and moody must be schizo then again maybe they are. But since Dori's psychological problems are irrelevant to the plot this doesn't really get in the way of the basic story. Val Kilmer does a good impression of a R. Lee Ermy drill sergeant. Ermy himself has gotten too old for these parts but this allows the director to show a nice human side rather than a simple caricature. Although the lyrics for Scotty Doesn't Know kept running through my head each time he was featured.The most compelling performance is by Agnes Bruckner playing the bestnamed character this decade Sue of the Dubervilles Dubois. Bruckner's scenes sparkle and you rejoice every time she appears. Bottom line virtually everyone will find something to like somewhere inside Stateside. It gives you basic training prep school girl rockers mental cases romance DWI hospitals sex mansions and Agnes Bruckner.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Sue's mother Carrie Fisher is threatening to sue and put her daughter in the mental institution. The principal of their high school Father Concoff Ed Begley Jr. is also severely injured in the incident. Mark Deloach is sent into the Marine Corps by his powerful father Joe Mantegna and the court. Sergeant Skeer Val Kilmer has to break down the rebellious Mark. Dori and Sue are released to a halfway house and become best friends.Other than a few meetings Mark and Dorri don't spend that much time together until fifty minutes. It's too long to start a romance and the chemistry suffers. It tries to be an Officer and a Gentleman. None of it is able to exceed the what it aspires to be. The two leads are capable of more and the story doesn't have enough tension. The story sets up some dark potential but in the end it does nothing with them.".

Sue's mother Carrie Fisher is threatening to sue and put her daughter in the mental institution. The principal of their high school Father Concoff Ed Begley Jr. is also severely injured in the incident. Mark Deloach is sent into the Marine Corps by his powerful father Joe Mantegna and the court. Sergeant Skeer Val Kilmer has to break down the rebellious Mark. Dori and Sue are released to a halfway house and become best friends.Other than a few meetings Mark and Dorri don't spend that much time together until fifty minutes. It's too long to start a romance and the chemistry suffers. It tries to be an Officer and a Gentleman. None of it is able to exceed the what it aspires to be. The two leads are capable of more and the story doesn't have enough tension. The story sets up some dark potential but in the end it does nothing with them.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a character study without enough character. The leading male role has no definable personality at all which is clearly not the fault of the actor playing the part. The leading female role has a striking personality but hardly does anything in the story. The biggest supporting female role starts out strong and then withers as the movie goes along. The biggest supporting male role is dynamically portrayed but is pretty much the same stereotype that's appeared in countless other films. Much of the rest of the cast gets a moment or two to shine which doesn't help a lot because none of them ultimately matter in the threadbare plot that does little but strand each character on screen with little to do.Mark Deloach Jonathan Tucker is a rich man's son who causes an auto accident that severely injures a priest Ed Begley Jr. and somehow causes a teenage classmate Agnes Bruckman to become emotionally disturbed. To avoid prison Mark gets shipped out to the Marines. His drill instructor Val Kilmer takes special care to entertainingly whip Mark into a man. In his attempts to make amends to his victim Mark meets her roommate. Dori Lawrence Rachael Leigh Cook is a schizophrenic celebrity who went away to the nuthatch after she started to break down on set and in public.That's the set up. Here's the plot. Mark and Dori fall in love. Their relationship turns out to be bad for Dori's mental health. They break up. Then two years later after exploiting a national tragedy for a plot point they get back together and liver happily ever after. And no I'm really not leaving anything out.Stateside claims to be based on a true story. Well I can imagine this story was a powerful and moving thing to live through. That doesn't mean it's an interesting thing to watch. Even though the film moves along at a good clip I lost interest in it about a half hour before it was over because there's just not enough going on. Well there's stuff going on. However it doesn't come together in a coherent narrative. I got to a point where I realized an awful lot of what I'd been watching wasn't going to lead anywhere or have any significance.The very pretty Rachael Leigh Cook does a nice job as Dori. Mental illness is too often either overly charming or overly threatening in movies. Cook effectively the appealing intensity and the disturbing erratic nature of someone dancing as fast as they can along the edge of sanity. The relationship between Dori and Mark a stupid guy the Marines have made so fearless he's unfazed by her imbalance is the most appealing thing about Stateside.Unfortunately it's one of only two things that work here. The other being the basic training scenes where Val Kilmer appears to take genuine delight in playing a fit macho alpha male. His torments of enlistee Deloach are amusing but nothing you haven't seen before.There are simply too many characters here who have nothing to do but orbit around Mark and Dori. And while Dori is a star who could support many planets Mark is a burned out cinder. He's a nonentity as a high school kid completely unexceptional as a Marineintraining and the only distinguishing characteristic he ever has is his reflexive affection for Dori.Oh and one other thing. At the end of the movie Dori and Mark finally break up. About 5 minutes later the story jumps forward in time two yearsand Dori and Mark get back together. I don't care what kind of tale you are telling you can't have a climactic breakup and feel good reunion take place within 5 minutes of each other at the end of your movie. It either falls flat or gives the viewer a case of emotional whiplash.If you don't care about plot and do care about Rachael Leigh Cook you might enjoy Stateside. But if unresolved and frankly forgotten conflicts and characters bother you this isn't your sort of thing.".

The radiant Agnes Bruckner plays their mutual friend and tries to make the Marine understand that he cannot cure schizophrenia through love alone. Set back in time when less was known about diseases like schizophrenia. Lots of great period music and many familiar faces in the adult roles like Val Kilmer as the drill sergeant Joe Montegna as the Marine's dad Ed Begleyt Jr. as the priest and Penny Marshall as the head nurse.

This film shows the very rough training that marines go through and Mark Deloach proves he can become a good marine and comes home to a very cold reception in his father's large mansion. Mark falls deeply in love with Rachael Cook despite the fact that she is a mental patient and all her professional nurses and doctors suggest that Mark stop seeing her and break off their relationship. This story clearly shows that if you love someone and cannot get them out of your mind night or day and really want them as soul mates to live with forever no matter who they are don't miss out on getting married and love each other to death.

A small film that only enjoyed limited release in theaters and isn't getting much attention on DVD either is Keith Gordon's latest Waking the Dead'. Back in 1992 there was another underappreciated independent film called A Midnight Clear' that had the misfortune of being released alongside the likes of Unforgiven' and Last of the Mohicans'. For reasons I can't fathom this brilliant film seemingly did nothing to help Gordon's career. His budgets stayed small but he continued looking for the most daring and fascinating material. In 1996  he released Mother Night' another warthemed film only this time set in the aftermath of WWII.With Waking the Dead' Gordon outdoes himself. He casts Billy Crudup as Fielding Pierce an ambitious Coast Guard officer who'd like to be presidentand he means it. His world is turned upsidedown when he meets Sarah Williams Jennifer Connelly who just wants to feel like she lives on the planet'. Fielding and Sarah could not be more different yet they cannot live without each other. Each is the antithesis of the other which dooms their relationship and intensifies their love at the same time. The film begins with the announcement of Sarah's death and continues pulling you back and forth in time. Employing this storytelling technique and maintaining the momentum of the story is a difficult task. While we see Fielding wrestle with her memory we're shown the powerful connection these two had during her life. What's more Fielding begins to see visions of her. Some of these visions are so real he begins to believe she's alive. The hauntings come just as he begins campaigning for the U.S. House. It begins to affect his life and threatens his campaign. The question of whether Sarah is really alive is the dramatic carrot Gordon dangles in front of us. It's then we realize that she was his conscience in life and remains so in death. Gordon pours it on right until the very last frame. He gets the best performance of Connelly's career out of her plus a jawdropping performance out of Crudup that's worthy of an Oscar. Whoever was in charge of plugging this film for awards nominations must have fallen asleep at the wheel though I see it did win an Independent Spirit award for its script.That this film or others in the same situation get no recognition is definitely for the best. The more popular a film becomes the more idiots that come out of the woodwork to secondguess it. So best to leave it to be discovered by those willing to seek it out. It is 2000's crown jewel.Grade A but only because there isn't a higher grade".

Anyone who has every loved another will know that you see that love wherever you go and the lead actor's portrayal of that emotion is at genius level.The most emotionally charged scene is at the restaurant of the election results are known and I for one cannot recall any movie where a particular scene is so intensely sensitive or almost uncomfortably realistic.For quiet and justifiably restrained but wonderful adult entertainment this is the best film I have seen in years. 10 out of 10.".

A stunning movie directing by none other than the director of A Midnight Clear another terrific film. If you are reading this you should seek out this movie or just buy it online.

	schema:headline " Another truly great character study from Keith Gordon";
	schema:reviewBody "Following in the big footsteps of The Chocolate War A Midnight Clear and Mother Night Waking the Dead is perhaps the most cohesive and satisfying film by Keith Gordon to date. This is a film composed of two parts. The first part is a love story which takes place in America but focuses on the violent overthrow of the Salvador Allende republic in Chile. Fielding Pierce the protagonist is an idealistic naval officer from a working class family. He meets Sarah played by the always lovely Jennifer Connelly a freethinking social activist and they begin a whirlwind romance. Soon though she leaves for Chile where she is murdered during the coup d'etat staged by Pinochet. Fielding of course is devastated and it leaves a scar on him which still hasn't healed when the film flashes forward to the eighties when he has gotten into politics. Attached now to an important politico's daughter Fielding has to make some important decisions regarding the ideals he holds so important while coping with a tremendous loss he never really came to grips with. Many critics have panned this film for being contrived and unbelievable mostly because of the ghost sequences and the chronological flashback vignette structure which Gordon uses to paint the story. I found it refreshing after so many Pulp Fiction wannabe timeline films having been made in the last 10 years. Also isn't it a bit wonderful to see a film that equates personal emotional turmoil with personal idealisticpolitical turmoil. In the midst of dealing with the lossreincarnation of Sarah Fielding is forced into making hard choices about what kind of man he is going to be a member of the political machine or a true servant of the people. A rare treat.".

	schema:reviewBody "You'll have to choose sides in 'Waking The Dead'. Are you going to be an obedient politician or a liberal activist? Those opposing viewpoints cause a tugofwar with eternal love playing the evertightening knot in the middle. Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly are Fielding and Sarah he the idealistic politician and she the faithful revolutionary. We know from the start that she dies via car bomb while raging against the machine. The movie's chronology is all over the place which is occasionally confusing and we see them when they're blissfully happy and otherwise. But after she's gone the upstanding young man fears for his marbles after he starts to see  hear his dead lover everywhere. Is she actually alive or is he just too insane for public office?Seeing ghosts is tricky. It can turn into unintentional humour without the proper direction. Director Keith Gordon doesn't pull it off as well as he should but at least the heat between them seems real. Crudup and Connelly make a great romantic match. She's sandpaper to his block of wood but she's also his conscience. The phrase Jiminy Cricket is actually used and he succeeds politically only as he's failing emotionally. He clearly needs her whispering in his ear even if he wouldn't agree with what she would have to say. It's clear that she wouldn't approve of what he's become and he knows it. So I guess that makes her the ghost of Jiminy Cricket too.The movie would be a turd without strong performances. While no one in the supporting cast has lingered in my memory the talented leads have. They're both good in almost everything they do so I expected them to be an excellent duo here too. Connelly has since won an Oscar and Crudup probably will too. Some of Gordon's directorial choices undercut what his actors are doing. His style of editing and use of too many arty shots don't work. When the actors are already front row centre the director should get out of their way.What grabbed me about 'Waking The Dead' was that both Fielding and Sarah are trying to make the world a better giant rock. She's counterculture and he's as mainstream as it gets. Since the story boils down to politics versus religion it's no wonder the film didn't find an audience. Most people have opinions on those matters yet political correctness demands you not share them. But you ARE allowed to discuss love. The movie knows how to get that right...the ache the irritation the yearning and the loss of true love.".

I LOVED IT!Yes the story of an up and coming politician falling in love with a beautiful leftwing activist is a bit trite but no more so than the 70's in which they shared their life together were naive idealistic and a necessary part of the evolution of American social conscience.I thought the performance by Jennifer Connelly as 'Sara' was astounding. Her ability to convey the sentiment of her beliefs in anger and love is nothing short of inspiring.  If you're not in love with Sara by the end of this movie you should check into the Emergency ward of your local hospital because there's no heart in your chest or warm blood flowing in your veins.Billy Crudup's performance as 'Fielding' could be interpreted as flat only to those who would say that life imitates art and not the other way around. I found Crudup's acting highly believable for the character he was portraying.  I know lots of extremely intense people who hide behind a facade of calm out of necessity.  Where he needed to be good he was exceptional.  Case in point during his celebration dinner with family after winning the election his declaration of his burgeoning insanity is extremely convincing and frightful.Aside of great individual performances the overall chemistry between Sara and Fielding was tangible necessary and believable as this is a story about love and why true love is endless.  The editing jumping between the present and the past helped to make the point that we all have the power to change the world through the people we come into contact with and in this way we're all eternal all powerful. To top it off the haunting presence that was Sara after she was presumably killed lends an element of mystery and hope in a metaphysical and real way to a movie that could have been just another too sweet love story in the hands of lesser director.Though Waking The Dead has its flaws they're too few to dwell on.  I've watched it now three times and every time I appreciate it more than the last. I suggest its detractors do the same before making hasty negative assessments.".

Fielding Pierce is passionate intelligent and honest. He possesses a sense of integrity that unfortunately is not very common in a world that becomes more apathetic with each day that passes. I relate to Fielding because like him I stand poised and ready to enter a career that I love but at the same time resent and hate for much of what it represents. Billy Crudup proves himself to be in the same category as Edward Norton Joaquin Phoenix and Leonardo Dicaprio as one of the greatest actors of his generation. Every time I watch Waking the Dead I find myself more moved by Crudup's passionate performance. I didn't think anyone could honestly portray Scott Spencer's amazing character but Crudup embodies Fielding heart and soul.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fielding Pierce Billy Crudup has one ambition to be President of the United States.  His entire life is planned out to reach that goal.  Only he didn't plan on Sarah Jennifer Connelly.  Sarah is a free spirited radical human rights advocate.  We meet them on the day she dies and then flash back to the inception of their relationship in 1972.  He is The Establishment personified.  She is an iconoclast.  Two philosophies more incompatible could not possibly exist but despite everything they fall in love. The story then fastforwards to Fielding's campaign for the House of Representatives ten years after Sarah's death.  It is at this time that Fielding becomes obsessed with Sarah's ghost.  He believes he is seeing her everywhere and that he is surely losing his mind.  He begins to question his own philosophies and begins to lose his will to win the election.The film is an engrossing character study of two very fascinating people cut of completely different cloth.  The nonlinear approach used by Director Keith Gordon was both a blessing and a curse.  Sometimes it provided important character development and motivation and at others it jumped back and forth for no good reason.  This often made the film seem disjointed and hard to follow.  Gordon's direction was only fair though he delivered accurate period renderings especially of the 1970's.  There were too many instances of unnecessary stylizing.  For instance there was excessive use of monologue jump cuts where he cut from the speaker saying one thing to the same speaker in the same spot saying something else.  He used it so often that it looked like bad editing.  In addition Gordon tended to focus on the schmaltzy romantic angle and downplayed the far more interesting philosophical tension.  He did give us some dialectic but generally cut away when the philosophical fireworks were just getting started.  He also kept treading over the same ground in different ways.  This made the story drag.The acting by both leads was terrific.  This film brings Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly together again both having appeared in Inventing the Abbotts'.  Crudup was extremely impressive as the tormented politician. This was an exquisitely complex character and Crudup flexed the role to the max.  Connelly was a bit more uneven in her role sometimes playing the role with great force but at others with a mousy selfconsciousness that was inconsistent with the character.  Still she gave Sarah great depth as both a lover and a crusader and a convincing passion for her beliefs.This is an absorbing but slow moving romance that is a bit heavy handed but nonetheless interesting.  I rated it a 710.  It showcases good performances by two young actors we will surely hear from again.  Not recommended for impatient viewers.".

It takes a while for the movie to get there and that's ok for the most part.  The only downside to the movie in my opinion is the romance because it tries to overshadow what is the bigger topicwhich I mentioned in my first sentence.  This is all disguised in what could have been a Ghost ripoff because the basic storyline involves a couple that falls in love one person dies and then haunts the other person but this movie is much deeper and just kind of carries the romance with it.  Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connely are the main attractions in this story and they both do an excellent job from beginning to end. Basically Billy's character follows a political career path and Jennifer's heart is more into helping peopleno matter if the'yre on the right side or the wrong side according to society.  This causes a conflict in their relationship and Jennifer leaves Billy but Billy still loves her and sees visions of her as he continues upward in his career.  Billy becomes hardhearted and career driven which seems to make his visions increase until he finally comes to a breaking point and faces the part of Jennifer's character that is still inside of him.  I won't give away the ending but it is obvious that in the way the filmmakers finished the movie that the romance was not the issue.  This is a unique and welldone piece of storymaking that deserved more attentionwhich I hope to give it with a 2nd viewing sometime soon hopefully.".

In the opening scene we see his reaction to the death of his girlfriend and the pain is right there in his eyes nothings hidden it's just a raw reaction to the worst moment in the characters life. The chemistry between Crudup and the equally talented Jennifer Connelly who plays Sarah is tangible. They ARE a couple these 2 actors appear so comfortable with each other you totally believe in the relationship. I first watched Waking the dead about 4 years ago and it left me stunned that a film with such emotional depth and superb performances went unnoticed atleast in the UKI was a film student at the time and not even my class mates had heard of it! But they had heard of junk like the Planet of the apes remake! I love this film so much and its as close to perfect as can be...Keith Gordon is one of the most underrated directors working watch A midnight clear for further proof...Billy Crudup should be in way more movies...Everyone should watch Waking the dead as soon as they can.".

Both Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connolly are fine actors and anyone offended by mawkish sentimentality will wince at some of the lines they are made to speak in this in this awful maudlin frustrating movie.Billy Crudup plays a superdecent supercaring supersensitive Democratic of coursejust one of this movie's many cliches Congressional contender. Jennifer Connolly is his lover from some 10 years ago who he believes has been killed in Chile rescuing people from a despotic regime.  Their affair is told through flashbacks. They have long senstive conversations.  When they fight they don't really fightthey are both too decent to yell at the other.  They just look hurt and we know that this is a very meaningful nonfight. Naturally he is a gentle lover she weeps during sex. Everyone in this movie is terribly earnest and LOVES to talk about what they're feeling. In other words This is the ber Chick Movie!But then when Crudup's character is running for office he begins seeing Connolly...around sometimes out of the corner of his eye sometimes everywhere a flock of her coming at him.  It seems likely...likely that she's alive...or is it his imagination?  We're never given a convincing reason why if Connolly is still alive she has been in hiding all these years or how such a sensitive decent person could justify doing what she did to him.  If she isn't alive...then ole Fielding is hallucinating and is therefore a psychopath and the whole idea that he could sustain a campaign let alone get elected is laughable.There is one remarkably inept scene in which Crudup's character Fielding is eating with Connolly her church coworkers two priests and 4 Chilean nationals they have just rescued.  One of the Chilean women confronts Fielding on his desire to become a politician condemning him specifically for becoming an American politician and welike Fieldingfeel the others in the room silently agreeing with her.  Fielding explodes but decently! pointing out their hypocrisy and how despite the world's fingerpointing at Americans it is OUR shores they so often wash up on when fleeing the terror of their homelands.  Finally he declares that he is choking on the collective superiority in this room! It is a good line and he delivers a great tirade...but everyone except perhaps the Chileans in this movie is so darn nice and good and wholesome that we can't believe for a minute that they can't see Fielding's goodness too.  So their collective superiority...it just doesn't ring true.In fact very very little in this movie rings true.  This is the sort of movie a 14yearold girl wanting an adult love story might like it displays precisely that sort of idealized emotional maturity.  Few discerning adults will be able to stomach it.  Even my wife who is the reason I sat through it disliked it.".

This is the sort of movie a 14yearold girl wanting an adult love story might like it displays precisely that sort of idealized emotional maturity.  Few discerning adults will be able to stomach it.  Even my wife who is the reason I sat through it disliked it.";

Unfortunately I have to say that it's not up to his usual standards.  Billy Crudup plays an idealistic young man with dreams of winning a seat in the US Senate.  Jennifer Connelly plays the idealistic young girl he falls in love with who has a slightly more radical take on government.  The events of the movie take place out of the linear time sequence.  The movie starts with Connelly's death and backtracks to when they first met... and it leapfrogs back and forth forever after... as the latterday Crudup begins to have visions of his dead girl coming back to life.  Is he crazy?  Is she a ghost?  Or did she fake her own death?  The acting is pretty good... especially by Crudup who gets all the showy emotional breakdown scenes... but the script and story are a bit on the bland side.  Not a bad movie... but kind of slow... and after all is said and done... doesn't really leave you with much.  A good movie for playing Spot The Canadian though... as all the smaller roles seem to be played by familiar Canadian actors... Molly Parker and Leah Pinsent among them.".

There is a point in the movie we don't know if Pierce is insane or if her girlfriend isn't dead at all an Elvis Presley resemblance maybe. In the first half hour of the movie it seems it will never engage but once she calls him on the phone or not the story becomes emotional and leaves the spectator out of breath. Also there were some moments this picture reminded me of Ghost and Titanic two unforgettable Hollywood romances but there isn't a moment that it tries to copy those movies. In the end even thought we don't find out what happened in fact the movie gives a good time and surprises the spectator which wasn't expected by anybody I guess. Love is eternal. Great movie!".

I did think it was interesting seeing the two rival gangs having to deal with one another but this stuff didn't work as well as it could have because the screenplay mostly has them shouting things at one another and calling each other the B word. The performances aren't Oscarworthy but all the actors fill their roles fine and deliver the type of performances you'd expect.

Trying to ban everyone together Campbell faces a tough task as these groups hate one another but must put aside their differences because of the greater threat. Soon however Caesar takes advantagewhen Campbell saves him from being swarmed by zombies risking his own life in the processof an opportunity presented to him and takes control of the group using his hand gun as a tool to do so. His tyranny will only last so long because his brother SpiderDanny Martinez has been bitten and is slowly succumbing to the zombie plague sweeping across the city. Despite being bound to a chair developing circumstances will lead to his release causing an escalating series of events which will leave few people standing. As expected the Latino and ghetto stereotypes are present as is their colorful language and dangerous attitude. The film maintains a relatively volatile atmosphere as Caesar is your usual bullying antagonist pointing his gun in people's faces ordering them around to do his bidding. You know that with him in charge the situation will only get worse because if the group doesn't work as a cohesive unit tempers will flare and violence is certain to occur. Weatherman is the rich suburbanite who weakens psychologically downing discovered booze his behavior a mix of fear paranoia and sadness. The zombies themselves have your typical facial discolor and drooling mouths rampaging on fresh victims en mass. Rarely do you see visible fleshripping or cannibalism because the zombies form in massive packs hovering over their victims as we listen to the screams. The fate of Caesar is certain to earn a round of applause from the audience who watches a film like this..he is quite a despicable lowlife who obviously gets his jollies from wielding his power with a revolver in his hand as those is fear for their lives do as he says. The most memorable death sequence comes at the end when a face is ripped apart from the mouth. I believe few will care for any of these characters and root for the zombies to tear them limb for limb. Despite the use of firearms and 2X4's the violence towards the zombies is quite tame..lack of budget I guess.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gangs of the Dead is a nicely handled and somewhat entertaining zombie film.SPOILERSTraveling through Los Angeles Mac T Ethan Ednee tells his friend Snake Dog Ryan King that he wants to quit the gang business and go legit following his finding of God. Meeting up with other friend they head on over to see Mitchell Reggie Bannister a local drug dealer and make a deal that soon gets interrupted by Santos Enrique Almeida and his gang Caesar Noel Gugliemi Spider Danny Martinez and Marsha Janine Foster who inform them all of a sting operation on the location. At the same time a group of ravenous zombies descends on both groups forcing the only police officers to survive O'Bannon Stephen Basilone and Campbell James C. Burns to seek shelter with them. Realizing that the zombies were created when a meteor strayed away from a shower and landed nearby they try whatever they can to get away ending up like the zombies.The Good News When it tries this one does have some good points to it. One of the big ones is that there's a lot of great action scenes in here. The encounters here provide some great parts including the really nice scenes at the beginning when the plague begins. From the general confusion at what's going on the chaos of the sting and the zombies coming together all at one time makes for some really nice action that is fun to enjoy. From there it gets in some bigger and better action from the first few escape attempts that end up meeting the zombies facetoface unexpectedly is quite nice. The ending is also really actionpacked including a couple of quite nicely done moments that come off as really surprising. It's also the most violent part of the film packing in some more gore than the rest of the film and these here aren't badly done. There's a big amount of bites that occur through the arms a very brutal severing numerous gunshots and a spectacular shot where a head is ripped open from the mouth all done in nice closeup seeing every graphic view. Rounding out the gore is all the great bite wounds and gunshot wounds that accumulate throughout the film from the beginning attacks to the last attacks giving this one a nice healthy gore quotient to it. The pace here is relatively nice keeping it moving forward at nice moments and making it feel exciting and never really dull. The last good moments come from the opening and closing moments dealing with the meteors as the beginning is a rather effectively done scene that is handled well and comes off as an original method for getting things done. The ending is also rather nice as it ends on a rather humorous note and is handled well considering what came before it. All in all this one here is pretty nice and entertaining.The Bad News This here doesn't have a lot of problems with it. One of the main ones is that it's way too clichd to really stick out of the crowd. The most obvious is a group of people who despise each other will have to try and put that aside in order to deal with a greater threat. However this film sets that scenario up with all the wrong ones. Gang members in particular who due to their lifestyles aren't exactly the types to put personal issues aside with their rivals for any reason including a zombie plague which is pretty much how the whole film breaks down with both rival organizations cursing at each other beefing with one another and threatening one another for a majority of the picture. That's also it's major problem considering that you can only watch people pull guns on each other and threaten serious violence against one another so many times before you feel like you're trapped in an endless loop. Sometimes as the viewer you wonder if they forget that zombies are lurking just outside the warehouse looking to make them their next meal. the whole gang member conflict takes a front seat for a large portion of the picture. The other flaw is that the zombies don't really look that great. Most of them look really similar to most other zombie films not really making a distinct impression one way or another. These here provide the film's only real flaws.The Final Verdict With some really nice points and a couple of noticeable flaws this one here is a watchable attempt at the genre as the positive ones win out. Check it out for fans of the urban horror flicks or general zombie films while those who aren't really big fans of either won't have a whole lot of fun with it.Rated R Extreme Graphic Language and Graphic Violence".

It also doesn't help that the majority of the characters are essentially uninteresting and unlikable even though the actors for the most part are actually better than expected and when they die you don't feel anything other than indifference. The apocalyptic finale actually leaves things open for a sequel but so far nothing has come up. Maybe that's a good thing.It's kind of a shame really because while watching it I couldn't help but feel that with a better script and director this could have been an enjoyable little zombie flick and that the Urban Horror genre could finally have had a good recent zombie effort.

However in this ones case I'll make an exception. You see this film while being known as Last Rites in the USA is called 48 Weeks Later in the UK. There are lots of great quotes on the packaging like DAWN OF THE DEAD EAT YOUR HEART OUT and THE BUMS ARE EATING THE COPS ?? but these have little or nothing to do with what is contained within. Yes folks if you buy this trash then you have been well and truly stitched up as the only way it resembles Danny Boyle's original and its sequel is the final two words of the title. That's it. Thankfully I only borrowed it from a friend I didn't make the mistake of wasting money on this ripoff.There are hardly any zombies no decent head explosions and most definitely no flesh eating viruses. No what this you see is a modern blaxploitation film and a pretty rubbish one at that. So if you want to spend 90 minutes watching black actors running around a badly lit warehouse shooting blanks at each other while talking like illegitimate sons of Shaft be my guest. You'll also be giving the film company licence to mislabel any product in the future in the hope that they'll make an easy buck out of gullible saps like you. What next... Predator as a romantic comedy? Titanic as a ship navigational guide? Gigli as an Oscar winning masterpiece? Remember it may be your money you're wasting but it could have devastating implications for all of us. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.In the meantime this waste of a perfectly good disc gets a 110 and a one way ticket to ebay. Starting bid 1p. Hope my mate can find a gullible sap to take it off his hands. Oh aren't I a hypocrite...".

The budget was low yes but that's how it is with BMovies. I think the acting was OK it was quite typical for ghettogangster movies. The zombies and effects were also well done for a BMovie. Music was OK nothing special but for its budget pretty fitting. But what I really liked was the story. It was quite nice not to watch only a movies were some guys fight zombies but there were some inner tensions because there are three different parties in this building so it's not only kill the damn zombie! but also whos side are you on man? and stuff like that. That's why liked it it had many surprises and was probably the freshest movie I watched in the last weeks although of course it was not that well done but still extremely entertaining. The ending was intriguing to me very well done as well. The only people I wouldn't recommend it to are People who don't like minorities for their stereotypical behavior people who don't like low budget and of course people who hate zombiesurvival stuff. But all in all I think it's very likable so go enjoy it.".

Instead they fall back to clichs stereotypes and hack writing then insert hints of social criticism. I'm not really impressed. As a horror fan I have a certain degree of tolerance for bad acting bad effects and poor writing. Low budgets really don't bother me. However this film has very little to recommend it besides the fact that Reggie Bannister has a cameo. If you've seen Night of the Living Dead Street Trash Assault on Precinct 13 or Reservoir Dogs I think you'll be pretty bored by this retread. There's no reason why low budget B films can't be trailblazers despite their limitations. However this film slavishly follows all the rules endlessly homagesrips off its influences and has no surprises for veteran horror fans. Its like a Troma film but without all the overthetop aspects that make those awful films enjoyable.It's not a total waste though. Some of the gore special effects and stunts are passable. It's got a rare starring role for Noel G. but he unsurprisingly plays yet another obnoxious Latino gangster. There's some clichd social criticism but they really missed out on an opportunity to make some intelligent and insightful statements on racism police brutality intolerance and violence. Instead it settles on the same clichd elements as every other directtovideo zombie film where stereotypes bicker and shout at each other for 90 minutes while occasionally being eaten by zombies.Watchable for zombie fans  but not recommended. Instead try a French horror film called La Horde which rose above its stereotypes and clichs to be a gory fun and memorable B movie with some interesting things to say about racism and police brutality... amid zombie carnage.".

I thinks it's cool to see some unexpected behaviors such as the cop going out to save the Spanish dudes only to get abandoned by them and left for dead  how rough! I kept asking myself aloud how the hell can you do that? He just saved your asses! But I feel it's those twists in the film that make it so much more enjoyable the typical whitemansaveswomanandoffintothesunset routine. Don't get me wrong I love the classics but I always welcome something new.I enjoyed the character developments as well as the interactions between all of them  perhaps the conversations were not all hearttoheart but how they choose to interact with the different races is very interesting to see especially when faced with a zombiecrisis.I'll be honest I never thought the undercover cop a girl at that would make it in the end and I was surprised but very pleased to see that a female protagonist was able to get alive  at least until she saw the flying rocks! The special effects were well done a lot of goo and no one can deny that seeing that guy's mouth ripped apart wasn't eye candy enough. The filmmakers put a lot of work into the zombies and although they're present in their entire film whether visually or spoken of I must admit I would have liked to have seen more of them and 1on1 fights but I guess that would mean I'm partial to zombiestereotypes.What I did find quite odd is that I don't recall seeing much braineating per say but skin was by all means ripping apart and the victim's screeches still resonate in my brain  that fudgin' weather man left that girl to be eaten alive!I won't say more so that people won't want to see the film but I think for a zombie flick it should be seen as both entertaining and original which in my opinion makes it stand out a lot more that films that try to copy the zombieformula.".

Not a must see but not an avoid at all cost either.";

Meanwhile two cops are staking out a warehouse a large drugs deal goes down  they call in backup to raid the place but the before they can reach the warehouse the cops are attacked by the zombies all the uniformed cops are killed  the two detectives only just manage to make it into the warehouse. With two opposing gangs two cops  hordes of flesh eating zombies outside the unlikely bunch must put their rivalries aside  work together in order to survive but as tensions rise inside the warehouse it might just be safer outside with the zombies...Cowritten produced  directed by Duane Stinnett this cheap Night of the Living Dead 1968 ripoff might have been alright if it were not for the horrible character's that make it an absolute chore to sit through. Basically Night of the Living Dead with an urban setting in a warehouse with cops  black gang members to keep the tensions high  the arguments coming Last Rites sees this bunch of people trapped inside a warehouse deciding whether to wait t for help or make a run for it. The story is alright I suppose but what really killed Last Rites for me were the annoying character's especially Caesar who just had a huge attitude problem throughout wanted to do nothing but antagonise  start arguments swear  get other people killed. This character  the way he acts gets really annoying you just want someone else to shoot him just to shut him up the other character's fare little better with two bland cops various black gang members who just swear a lot  try to give it lots of attitude. It becomes incredibly tedious to watch  as I said the story isn't bad if the film was populated with more likable character's that you could emphasise with  root for then Last Rites might have been decent as it is it doesn't so isn't.Retitled to Gangs of the Dead for it's US DVD release  puzzlingly to 48 Weeks Later for it's UK DVD release the film is fairly colourless  a bit bland to look at but competent enough  the initial CGI computer effect of the meteorite crashing to Earth in Los Angeles is quite impressive. There's a bit of gore a woman has her arm rippedoff there are a few zombie flesh eating scenes  a scene in which a guy has his head ripped in half. There is one moment that makes no sense though when Dick Weatherman  his girlfriend are attacked in his car why doesn't he drive away when she is pulled out  eaten? Why does Dick then get out of the car  just randomly run away? Wouldn't it have been better to drive off? The again what do I know. I was attacked by flesh eating zombies I'd rather run than drive off in a nice fast car I mean that makes sense right?Filmed in Los Angeles the production values are decent the special effects are alright  it's not the worst looking low budget zombie film out there. The acting isn't great the character's who are all annoying anyway come across as even worse.Last Rites is a decent attempt at a low budget urban gang Night of the Living Dead that gets a few things right but the horrible character's ruin the film as you just want to see them all ripped apart  eaten as soon as possible.".

This is the kind of filmmaking that prompted me to fall in love with the movies. Brilliantly inspired writing by William Gibson from his equally inspired play. Intelligent austere direction by Arthur Penn one of the true gentlemen and masters of the American cinema Penn had the sense to retain the inate artistry and grit of the original stage play and simply allow the camera to capture the actors' intuitive  albeit well rehearsed performances recreating their stage roles which generated an unheardof 19 curtain calls when it first graced the stage in its Philadephia opening. The film in stark black and white speaks total reality to the film audience of 1962  and of course well beyond that year. Finally one would be hard pressed to think of another film that so exquisitely defines the term 2character study. Bancroft and Duke deliver Aplus no bones about it topdrawer performances.  It is a film about the undaunted human spirit and our need to communicate.  Although much has been written about 11minute breakfast donneybrook which is certainly wonderful cinema to behold the entire film is breathtaking from opening credits to the final scenes. I dare anyone to even breathe during the climactic water pump scene when teacher Annie Sullivan finally connects and communicates with her unreachable charge the deaf blind young Helen Keller. It's an absolutely astonishing can't take your eyes off it moment of celluloid. Duke Bancroft and Penn worked beatifully to create this incredibly touching masterpiece of dramatic filmmaking which is not without its moments of comedy as all fine dramas are capable of conveying. It is a film which breathes life  and it is especially brought to life by two of the best actresses America has ever produced. The Miracle Worker is a story and film portraying real human courage patience and individual personal will. It continues to live in my memory as a work of art that has rarely been equalled before  or since  on screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "With two terrific leading performances an absorbing and thoughtprovoking story and many wellconceived touches by Arthur Penn and his production team this classic version of The Miracle Worker is an exceptional movie that appeals to the imagination and that has much to say about humanity. The story itself is so good that even the lesser remakes have been worth seeing but there is really no reason at all to look any further than this nearly flawless filming of the story.As Annie Sullivan and Helen Keller Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke could not have been better. The battle of wills and wits between the two is engrossing becoming quite involved and very interesting. The lengthy dining room struggle alone would make any movie worth watching  it is worthwhile even beyond the interesting action itself as it brings out aspects of human nature and human learning that go beyond even Helen's own trials.There is a great deal of substance to the movie that goes beyond the immediate issues and confrontations and a significant reason for the greatness of the film is the way that Bancroft and Duke tap into the imagination of the viewer. The concept of seeing an unseen world and the challenge of helping someone to see it is brought out in ways that are profound yet accessible.The two leads carry almost the whole picture as the other characters are there primarily for Annie and Helen to play off of. Accordingly the supporting cast keep their characters more simple and their performances stylized and almost exaggerated which allows Bancroft and Duke to have most of the moments of significance. The production also enhances the picture through simple but wellconceived settings use of lighting and other features that nicely complement the main action.It's always rather unfortunate that movies like this one which take a little effort to appreciate fully are not given more attention. If you stop to consider what Helen Keller had to face in life it is a situation far more terrifying than facing any of the cartoonish artificial movie villains that gain so much notoriety. And if you consider the job that Annie Sullivan had to do her accomplishment is far more impressive and worthwhile than almost any scientific discovery feat of athletics or military exploit.That this movie is able to convey such themes makes it a memorable classic that is much more worthwhile than many movies that have received far more acclaim.".

It also depicts with deep understanding and identification the glory of that early relationship we all have one way or another that between child and teacher. There's a line that Annie Sullivan speaks about words being our vision 5000 years into the past that could apply to this film and play its words are our vision into the silent and sightless world of Helen Keller. Unlike many period films shot in the sixties this one was true to its setting. It hasn't dated a bit. And unlike many films of plays it never seems stagebound. The black and white camerawork and editing by people who strangely  had very limited careers is superb. The dining room scene is one of the most brilliantly shot and edited sequences I have ever seen. The music is subtle when it needs to be and powerfully effective in the big scenes. The use of flashbacks for Annie's troubled past is done artfully and in a way true to the emotional content of the memories. The acting by Bancroft and Duke is of course legendary but the supporting roles are equally well played. But it's probably the director Arthur Penn who is most responsible for the film's success. He saw the play through its journey from live television drama to Broadway to film.".

Patty Duke is also outstanding as Helen portraying the disturbed child as she works to overcome bad manners and temper tantrums the result of being overly indulged by her well meaning but ineffective parents. Moving into a small cottage away from her parents Anne who was partially blind herself assists Helen with some tough love and begins to teach her to spell with her fingers.Until this point Helen had no understanding of the meaning of words. This changed when Anne led her to the water pump and spelled out the word water as she pumped the water over Helen's hand. She is said to have learned thirty words the same day and eventually learned to read. In 1904 Helen graduated from Radcliffe College becoming the first deafblind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.

All of the forces involved  Ann Bancroft as Annie Sullivan Patty Duke as Helen Keller the supporting cast writer William Gibson and certainly director Arthur Penn  combine to present a straightforward wellpaced stark yet richly resonant retelling of Annie's early encounters with Helen.Bancroft is magnificent as Annie a character who is haunted by her early years of abuse and misery not to mention nearly losing her own sight completely. But she is feisty intelligent and fiercely determined. She overcomes. It would take nothing less to tackle her charge. When we meet the child Helen she is wild animalistic and out of the control of her parents. Patty Duke's portrayal is absolutely aweinspiring. Her acting abilities at the actual age of 16 are uncanny. Watching her Helen collide with the outer world from an utterly isolated state really stirred my imagination into exploring as it never had how dark unknowing confused and primitive such a person would be. Duke seemed to understand this about Helen on the deepest level.The script presents a journey toward transcendent understanding on Helen's part though it is effectively measured with a mixture of setbacks and small triumphs. Annie's journey too is well told she is new to tutoring and her constant tussles with Helen's family require the firmest belief in herself. The dining room confrontation is masterfully acted and directed. Its forceful and violently physical clash of wills leaves you exhausted. The other scene to equal it in intensity is Helen's breakthrough connection of water indeed all things in her life to language. Here Annie's hard work has paid off and the floodgates open inside the ecstatic Helen. It's the peak of the film and is guaranteed to make most of us cry after an hour and a half of unrelenting buildup.This is one of those singular and extraordinary films that simply everybody should see. The indomitable human spirit the capacity to adapt and grow this applies to all members of the cast the will to persevere through impossible odds...all of it and more is captured in this mesmerizing story.".

Anne Bancroft as teacher Annie Sullivan and Patty Duke as young Helen Keller are outstanding. Sullivan's determination to communicate to the deaf and blind Helen made for a compelling story on stage as well as on screen.I understand that when Hollywood wanted to make this movie the powersthatbe did not want Bancroft or Duke. After finally seeing the movie I'm glad that director Arthur Penn and producer Fred Coe chose to make this movie outside the socalled Hollywood establishment.One scene that was discussed in some other posts was the dining room in which Sullivan forces Helen to eat food from a spoon and not her hands. It almost felt like I was watching a fierce wrestling match. It was a physical as well as an emotionally draining sequence. A battle of wills between teacher and the unwilling student. It was brilliantly edited and directed.The film was not without faults. According to the IMDb a number of flashback scenes were filmed in their entirety but did not work out very well. Those scenes were incorporated within the movie and it looked rather clumsy. The scenes could have been easily edited out completely.As with all plays adapted to the big screen some scenes were a little bit stagy. But that involved just a few scenes and overall it did not ruin the movie.What I really liked about the movie was that the filmmakers were very successful at not succumbing to sentiment. This movie could have easily been very corny and sappy. Perhaps Bancroft and Duke and their performances had something to do with that.I've been a fan of Anne Bancroft for many years and I'm very glad that I had the chance to see her welldeserved Oscarwinning performance.RIP Ms. Bancroft.".

	schema:reviewBody "The career of Richard Linklater has proved one of the most delightfully eclectic in the film industry veering between works as diverse as teenage subculture films Dazed and Confused to philosophical romances Before Sunrise to drugaddled paranoid thrillers A Scanner Darkly to mainstream comedies School of Rock. But even with such a varied body of work it is difficult to deny Linklater's latest still seeming somewhat of an anomaly a lighthearted period piece examining the timeless figure of Orson Welles making his name through a 1930s theater production of Julius Ceasar still seems an odd about face even for such a versatile director. And yet it is somewhat fitting that such a whimsically talented modern director should examine one of cinema's most legendary mavericks as Linklater's latest Me and Orson Welles is a charming addition to his body of work a breezy self reflexive yet nostalgic celebration of the mediums of performance as experienced alongside one of the most dynamic and influential figures ever to impact them.The agile script ably captures the conflicting clashes of the behemoth of a personality that was Orson Welles from the explosive temper tantrums to the slyly manipulative charm to the casual womanizing painting a vivid but likely not larger than life portrait of the man without either romanticizing or demonising him. It is ultimately the presence of the titular character which rescues the film from becoming yet another cast rehearsing a play film as the dynamo of Welles tearing through the film at all the least expected moments creates a sporadic force of havok keeping the film continually off kilter preventing it from descending into clich and keeping it consistently interesting as consequence. While the story's lightness of touch does make some of the plot points either overly obvious or unbelievable a film so unassumingly enjoyable fails to evoke much complaint  whether dabbling in the dramatic or the comedic Me and Orson Welles remains refreshingly cheerful and earnest and all the better for it. Completing the package Linklater's rare tackling of a period piece demonstrates his typically astute ability to capture the feel and flavour of the times with the earnest ambition of the 1930s well complimented by subtly stylish sets and costumes while simultaneously avoiding beating the audience over the head with more overt details of the time instead of the potential hackneyed Nazi allusions Linklater includes merely a brief radio snippet which is quickly cut off a classy and subtle inclusion. Undergoing a difficult transition from teenage heartthrob to dramatic lead Zac Efron gives a surprisingly solid performance as the idealistic young actor swept into the wild world of Welles convincingly contributing charm comedy and genuine sympathy to the emotional centerpoint of the film. However given the title it isn't difficult to imagine the inevitable highlight of the show and true enough as the infamous Welles British stage actor Christian McKay doesn't so much steal scenes as seize and throttle them exploding on screen with the same engrossing bluster that only the real Welles himself could conjure up. Blending the conflicting elements of an indisputably difficult character as easily as he nails the trademark voice and appearance McKay's Welles alternates between devilish charmer and explosive force to be feared shaking up the film with similar vigour and nuanced genius  one of the most impressive cinematic debuts in recent memory. Claire Danes is also on top form as a good hearted but endlessly ambitious member of Welles' company and Ben Chaplin and James Tupper are endearing presences as eccentric members of Welles' calamitous company.As unconventional a project as it may be Me and Orson Welles remains one of the most unashamedly lighthearted and enjoyable forays into nostalgia in many a year breezily blending the serious with the silly while never skimping on historical fact. The addition of McKay's brilliantly combustive Welles make the theatrical rehearsal sequences a joy to behold instead of drearily formulaic making Linklater's latest film a charm to behold for even the most cynical of audiences. 810".

Richard Linklater the director has an ace up his sleeve with the casting of Christian McKay an actor who is a relative newcomer in film that is just about right. It's actually a case where the actor perhaps due to the personalitycharacter of the man he's portraying upstages others around him. This is good as is McKay being in his 30's making 22atthetime Orson appear or act olderwiser since Welles is a man who could take over a room and in fact was looked upon to do so with his Mercury theater players who couldn't even do much rehearing or anything until he showed up. McKay goes into every little gesture or facial expression with gusto and equally some sublty when called for like when talking about his pet project of the Magnificent Ambersons.It's almost so good a performance as Welles that you should see the movie just for him fans of the directoractorlegend will want to see him brought to life and made in respectful homage and nonfans will be marveled by a thespian bringing another thespian to life. There is a downside however in Linklater's casting not so much with the supporting roles as they vary between being very good like the guy playing Joseph Cotten aka 'Joe the lady's man' to decent like Ben Chaplain as Coulouris with Zak Efron. It's admirable that he's trying to get past his days of High School Musical and build up an actual career but he doesn't breathe enough life into his comingofage character Richard to make him more than just passable. He's a cute kid yet he's not really able to meet up to the dimensions of the character which to be fair are kind of thin.Linklater's film is inherently interesting dramatization just on the main subject matter Welles and the Mercury theater putting on the daring production of Julius Caesar that would propel him and his troupe into the first real spotlight. However the film is most interesting and gets its main dramatic fire when it focuses on the rehearsals and some of the backstage antics i.e. an accidental settingoff of the sprinklers by Richard fooling with matches not so much the quasilove story between Clare Danes' character with Efron. It's not got anything we haven't seen before even in the sort of whimsical fable that Linklater lays out. The conclusion of their relationship is wise as is how Welles 'deals' with Richard late in the film but ultimately one kind of sighs and sits through a lot of soso actingpouting by Efron in order to get to the juicier scenes with Welles. But as I mentioned before it's worth a fullprice pretty much on the basis of Welles and McKay. As Welles himself could be exceptional andor decent at once. 7.510".

	schema:headline " Welles lives";
	schema:reviewBody "Orson Welles is alive and well and residing in the body of British actor Christian McKay! McKay is simply stunning here as Welles  the look the eyebrow the mannerisms the bounce the voice  never have i seen Welles as a character better done. Many have tried few have succeeded although i have a soft spot for Vincent D'Onofrio's Wellescameo in Ed Wood.The same can be said in general for Richard Linklater's film in terms of featuring Welles and using the whole putting on a show theatrical device. I didn't like Oliver Parker's Fade To Black with Danny Huston hamming Welles. RKO 281 was solid and Tim Robbins' Cradle Will Rock was a noble if unsatisfyingly drear effort. Aided by McKay's towering achievement a mostly superb supporting cast and a deft lightness Linklater has delivered his best film in years.To my mind he can be hit Dazed  Confused Before Sunrise and miss A Scanner Darkly Fast Food Nation but this is firmly in the hit category.Other nonWelles films such as Kenneth Branagh's In The Bleak MidWinter have failed in their attempts to have fun at putting on a show format because they are too in love with moments that have that you just had to be there element. Christopher Guest made a go of it in Waiting For Guffman but then he was mocking the pretensions so many others embrace as part of the scene. Somehow McKay's as Welles enormous personality and Linklater's breezy makes it look so easy style make you feel like you are there in Me  Orson Welles and it works to great effect  tantalising the viewer with moments and flashes of the play to come without giving it to you until the right time. The 'Me' of the title really becomes the viewer. You are swept along me both filmmaker and Orson and it really does feel like Orson. After a few moments i never doubted the Linklater had somehow resurrected Welles and saddled him with Zac Efron! And this brings me the film's one real problem and surely a marketing nightmare for the distributors! Now i'm no Efron hater i haven't seen any of the HSM movies but he was fine in both Hairspray and 17 Again but here he has to register in a fantastic ensemble of actors and he simply doesn't. Admittedly he is hamstrung a little by the role. Since the story and Linklater's direction make the viewer feel like 'Me' observing Welles as he creates his legendary production of Julius Caesar and the Mercury theatre company it is easy to kind of forget about Efron's Richard or at least to dismiss him as Welles so often does. He just makes no impression at all. He's not bad he's just not really significant.This leads to the inevitable problem that as we reach the films final act once the play is done and Welles is off screen you feel like the movie is over. You've seen everything there is to see here it is time to move along. But no because Efron's story is unresolved so we get another 10 minutes of him and his ending. But you simply don't care. Once McKayWelles had gone off with his supporting cast the movie was over it just didn't know it! Amongst the supporting cast Claire Danes continues in display as easy charm effortlessly likable and curiously beautiful in her quirky angular way. Zoe Kazan last seen in Revolutionary Road is a delight as the underused other woman in Efron's life although if she'd been used more it would have meant more Efron less Welles so maybe that's a blessing in disguise. James Tupper is excellent as Joseph Cotten a great match for McKay's Welles. If they ever God forbid remake The Third Man they have the cast! Ben Chaplin is also marvellous as George Couloris. I'm constantly impressed by Chaplin and have no idea why he isn't a bigger name. Kelly Reilly doesn't have much to do but look gorgeous which naturally she does with ease. Eddie Marsan seems miscast as John Houseman. I like Marsan but he didn't fit the bill for me here.Ultimately this is McKay's show. He gives an electrifying performance at the center of a movie that while it is about Welles efforts to put on Julius Caesar is a charming funny and swiftpaced joy but unfortunately it also has to make space for Zac Efron and his own storyline and therein lie the flaws.How you market this i don't know! I can't imagine Efron fans getting excited about a film set in the 1930s about the creation of an historic theatrical production staged by a man who's been dead for 25 years! And on the flipside i nearly didn't see it because i dismissed it on first awareness as a Zac Efron movie and so not for me. Only on a second invitation did i notice it was directed by Linklater always interesting if not always successful which charged my want to see it.Ultimately though if you want to see it because you're an Efron fan well go see it because your guy's in it and because you'll get to see something a bit different from what you're used it. And maybe you'll like it. If you're not an Efron fan never fear you can all but forget he's there and just enjoy Linklater at his breezy best and the best performance of Welles on screen since the great man departed this earth and took possession of McKay!".

	onyx:emotionText "Orson Welles is alive and well and residing in the body of British actor Christian McKay! McKay is simply stunning here as Welles  the look the eyebrow the mannerisms the bounce the voice  never have i seen Welles as a character better done. Many have tried few have succeeded although i have a soft spot for Vincent D'Onofrio's Wellescameo in Ed Wood.The same can be said in general for Richard Linklater's film in terms of featuring Welles and using the whole putting on a show theatrical device. I didn't like Oliver Parker's Fade To Black with Danny Huston hamming Welles. RKO 281 was solid and Tim Robbins' Cradle Will Rock was a noble if unsatisfyingly drear effort. Aided by McKay's towering achievement a mostly superb supporting cast and a deft lightness Linklater has delivered his best film in years.To my mind he can be hit Dazed  Confused Before Sunrise and miss A Scanner Darkly Fast Food Nation but this is firmly in the hit category.Other nonWelles films such as Kenneth Branagh's In The Bleak MidWinter have failed in their attempts to have fun at putting on a show format because they are too in love with moments that have that you just had to be there element. Christopher Guest made a go of it in Waiting For Guffman but then he was mocking the pretensions so many others embrace as part of the scene. Somehow McKay's as Welles enormous personality and Linklater's breezy makes it look so easy style make you feel like you are there in Me  Orson Welles and it works to great effect  tantalising the viewer with moments and flashes of the play to come without giving it to you until the right time. The 'Me' of the title really becomes the viewer. You are swept along me both filmmaker and Orson and it really does feel like Orson. After a few moments i never doubted the Linklater had somehow resurrected Welles and saddled him with Zac Efron! And this brings me the film's one real problem and surely a marketing nightmare for the distributors! Now i'm no Efron hater i haven't seen any of the HSM movies but he was fine in both Hairspray and 17 Again but here he has to register in a fantastic ensemble of actors and he simply doesn't. Admittedly he is hamstrung a little by the role. Since the story and Linklater's direction make the viewer feel like 'Me' observing Welles as he creates his legendary production of Julius Caesar and the Mercury theatre company it is easy to kind of forget about Efron's Richard or at least to dismiss him as Welles so often does. He just makes no impression at all. He's not bad he's just not really significant.This leads to the inevitable problem that as we reach the films final act once the play is done and Welles is off screen you feel like the movie is over. You've seen everything there is to see here it is time to move along. But no because Efron's story is unresolved so we get another 10 minutes of him and his ending. But you simply don't care. Once McKayWelles had gone off with his supporting cast the movie was over it just didn't know it! Amongst the supporting cast Claire Danes continues in display as easy charm effortlessly likable and curiously beautiful in her quirky angular way. Zoe Kazan last seen in Revolutionary Road is a delight as the underused other woman in Efron's life although if she'd been used more it would have meant more Efron less Welles so maybe that's a blessing in disguise. James Tupper is excellent as Joseph Cotten a great match for McKay's Welles. If they ever God forbid remake The Third Man they have the cast! Ben Chaplin is also marvellous as George Couloris. I'm constantly impressed by Chaplin and have no idea why he isn't a bigger name. Kelly Reilly doesn't have much to do but look gorgeous which naturally she does with ease. Eddie Marsan seems miscast as John Houseman. I like Marsan but he didn't fit the bill for me here.Ultimately this is McKay's show.

Zac Efron does his best here to leap from Disney heartthrob to leading man and I personally thought he was solid and likable with just enough of a sparkle in his eye and just enough skill to keep it there.Overall this film has a charming story which ends on such a high note I didn't know whether to smile or cry.

	schema:reviewBody "Considering the fanatic cult following that Richard Linklater has developed with films like Waking Life Before SunriseSunset and A Scanner Darkly let me preface this review by saying that I'm not a Linklater devotee. If Linklater is endowed with a species of genius I must confess complete ignorance to it. Indeed my favorite Linklater film was School of Rock and he has always impressed me more by the breadth of his work and his willingness to challenge the conventions of film than by any individual film. It's perhaps this maverick spirit that drew him to do a film about Orson Welles.Me and Orson Welles based on a novel by Robert Kaplow tells the story of a teenager Richard Samuels Zac Efron who is swept from learning about Shakespeare in the classroom to the fast paced world of the Mercury Theater on Broadway when he lands a role in Orson Welles famous 1937 production of Caesar. As Orson Welles struggles to get the production ready for the premier Richard falls for the theater's resident hottie a charming and ambitious aspiring actress played by Claire Daines and finds himself growing up quickly to the realities of show business and the real world.The movie is entirely carried by it's acting and the actor generating the most buzz is the British born Christian McKay who plays Welles. I'm very uneasy about praising portrayals of real life figures because it seems any time an actor plays any historical figure from Gandhi to Capote and Idi Amin they receive excessive attention. I think it has less to do with the acting involved than it has to do with the fact that most audiences feel much more comfortable passing judgment and bestowing praise on mimicry than actual acting. That said McKay does a masterful job in capturing that mythical image of a young Orson Welles that all of us film geeks have in our head from the striking resemblance in appearance to the pitch perfect intonations in his voice. Welles is charming and maddening endearing and brutal and always larger than life... and McKay captures it all perfectly. It's clearly a role that McKay has been mastering for a long time as he was doing a onemanshow about Welles on Broadway before being snatched for the role in Me and Orson Welles. From the QA session at the Toronto international film festival McKay seemed intelligent and passionate about his work and I truly hope he doesn't get pigeonholed into spoofing Welles for his entire career.Unfortunately the other acting foot that the movie stands on isn't nearly as good. Zac Efron is just so pretty and I say this as a heterosexual male that it becomes distracting. Watching Efron act it feels like he's trying to make women orgasm in every scene he's in which works well in enough in the many scenes he's trying to court Claire Daines's character but doesn't work in any other scene. Efron's acting makes it hard for the audience to emotionally connect and prevents the movie from achieving the emotional punch it might otherwise. The audience is never drawn in and they remain spectators which fortunately isn't such a bad thing since the movie is so fun and nostalgically charming. Perhaps even the flighty and ethereal feeling the film gets because of it's lack of punch can be forgiven since it's a movie about youth and growing up and so much of that involves tempestuous passions that end up being quite meaningless in retrospect.810".

Nominally Zac Efron plays the lead as Richard Samuels who is almost 18 and yearning to become an actor. A chance encounter with Orson Welles outside the Mercury theatre leads to Richard being cast as Lucius. Welles was one of those larger than life characters who had so much talent that they could get away with having a rather inflated ego.This is the first time I have seen Zac Efron on screen and I have got to say he played the role of the star struck teenager very nicely. The character is full of dreams and it certainly resonates long after the film has finished.If Christian McKay does not get a supporting actor Oscar nomination for his Orson Welles portrayal it will be a travesty. He is quite simply superb. I've always found Claire Danes very engaging and she is also very good in this as are a number of the supporting cast including Ben Chaplin and Zoe Kazan.If you are after traditional blockbuster fare from your movies then you are probably well advised to skip Me and Orson but if you like an intelligent film that is well scripted well directed by Richard Linklater and well acted then it's a must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw that Richard Linklater had a new film at the Toronto International Film Festival and that it took place during Orson Welles' run at the Mercury Theatre I was very interested. Me and Orson Welles is based off a novel which creates a fictional character to be our entry point into the tumultuous world of Welles' troupe attempting to get a performance of Julius Caesar out the gate. Young Richard Samuels finds and cons his way into a small part with the play meeting the likes of Joseph Cotton George Coulouris and Welles all before Citizen Kane made them Hollywood players. Centering on a more specific period of time not sprawling out to multiple plot lines like Robbins' opus Me and Orson Welles is an authentic view of that time period a veritable time capsule of Welles' ego before he had the film industry in the palm of his hand.I've never seen High School Musical or Hairspray but just looking at Zac Efron you can't help but think nothing good could come of his casting. In my shocking surprise he was actually quite good and possibly perfect in the role. The entire film hinges on his believability as a cocky yet talented high schooler that talks his way onto a high profile performance while he should be taking pop quizzes. This teen is unafraid to speak his mind and truly believes that he deserves the same respect as anyone else on the project even if that means standing up to the giant that is Orson Welles. He is a kid though and he's navet comes out at numerous times mostly to humorous effect. Embroiled in a five dollar bet with Cotton and Norman Lloyd about who can sleep with secretary Sonja first when Richard's chance finally happens his shyness and awkwardness add a nice slapstick comedic feel. Efron actually has a good handle on his facial expressions helping both effectively add to the comedy while also to the realism of the time period we are watching as far as acting style went back thenover the top and hammy.This kid becomes a big part of Welles' life in the story. The master takes him under his wing to show the ropes of theatre drama and radio grooming him with superfluities and compliments. What Richard doesn't yet realize is the cutthroat nature of the industry and how everyone will lie cheat and steal to get what he wants. The boy's relationships blossom with the actors and Sonja allowing him to comfortably make a name for himself in Broadway with them. He just can't learn that sometimes you have to swallow your pride and give into someone who can't to appease them and further your own career. Richard is young though and he doesn't yet feel this is it for him the end all be all. So when some might think a brazen attitude and confidence could be a necessary trait in theatre a man like Welles will have none of it. Why would a man like him want a mirror held up to his face? No he is the leader and you will listen.It is a shame that whenever someone is called upon to play Orson Welles it always ends up being a caricature or impersonation. It is true with Angus Macfadden in Cradle Will Rock and it is true here with newcomer Christian McKay found in a oneman show doing the part and cast as a result. McKay is everything you'd think about with the legend from the brash authoritative moods to the welcoming smiles charismatically pulling you in to do whatever he wants. Definitely more an embodiment of Welles himself than a performance of a character you can't really fault him for it. A man that recognizable can only be done with impression and McKay does it to perfection.As for the rest of the cast everyone is great. Eddie Marsan is a stalwart and nice practical foil to Welles' mercurial genius James Tupper knocks Joseph Cotton out of the park playing a lothario that tries his best to shield Richard and help him stay in Welles' good graces Leo Bill is a lot of fun as the improvisercomedian Lloyd and Claire Danes likable as the object of everyone's affection Sonja. There is also Zoe Kazan as the writer Richard meets one day at a record shop. She is the one link he has to the real world grounding him away from the chaos and narcissism the acting lifestyle brings. A real person with goals and aspirations her Gretta allows for the best relationship with Efron's character. It is a sideplot that one could say needed to be beefed up but I actually think comprised just the right amount of time. Only coming back into the story every so often it was a necessary juxtaposition to the craziness in the theatre showing us the real Richard and not the act he put on to be a success.The story is slight even though there is a lot going on. I would even agree that Linklater has crafted such a tight piece it seems simpler than it is because he makes it so. Some instances are so good the poet Sinner in the play slowly being surrounded by silhouetted actors onstage that I can't get the image out of my head. That said I might blame the fact I love Cradle Will Rock so much that this one just doesn't quite compare. Me and Orson Welles is a great film highly recommended but to me nothing glaringly special. It's just one of those films that I can praise over and over again for its parts but when I think of the whole realize that it never fully resonated with me past being a wellmade wellacted piece of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Linklater taking on Orson Welles? Sign me up. The only thing really unfortunate about this movie is the title the only justification of which I can tell is that the lead character is so young and brash that he thinks of himself before Orson Welles but ironically thinks so in grammatically incorrect terms. However this not being backed up by an explanation it may also just simply be a grammatically bad title. I do not know all I know is that it's unfortunate.Anyway onto the actual movie itself. Orson Welles being a particularly iconic figure not only for Citizen Kane but also for the independent film industry as a brash young intelligent egoist willing to stand up to the biggest of institutions it is not surprising that independent filmmakers love to take him on. Here the story is something like Orson meeting Orson where a younger brash slightly less intelligent egoist has his ten seconds of fame working sidebyside with Welles on the stage and in the process making a dizzying delightful sexy ride of it until the brakes are hit hard and bloody noses are bounced off a few dashboards.Zac Efron plays Richard a bored high school student who wants to be an actor !. Or a writer !. Or an artist !. Or whatever he ultimately has to admit allows him to participate in the world where creativity meets fame. Strolling across the city one day after a very Linklaterian meeting with cute and reserved Gretta Zoe Kazan he manages to act as such an attention whore that he gets under the radar of none other than 37 year old Orson Welles Christian McKay currently producing his Nazithemed version of Julius Caesar. Taken on board Richard got game but ultimately his own needy desire for recognition and of course the always fun issue of a girl Claire Danes eventually brings Orson Welles and Richard into conflict. And I mean c'mon he's going up against Orson Welles! Actor to actor of course Richard doesn't stand a chance. Actor to actor otherwise Zac Efron and Christian McKay are perfectly matched McKay for his spoton presentation of Welles' cigarchewing egotism and Efron for having to hold the brunt of the movie on his back basically being the exact type of youth that once upon a time was Richard and these days is more recognized as that friendwhore on Facebook. It is like the matching of Amy Adams to Meryl Streep in Julie  Julia what is it with these ampersands?! where one plays a recognized historical figure to aplomb and the other perfectly nails the navelgazing millennial everyone despises but it is to the actor's credit that such a vapid character ultimately ends up being engaging. To Efron's credit he may not be perfectly embodying Orson Welles but he is perfectly embodying the part of all of us that wants to be Orson Welles.The rest of it really is all Linklater. Ultimately the shy and awkward girl is the right way to go the intellectual discussions say more about the characters' own perspectives than about the story's themes brighteyed youth looks to the future despite being shackled by its own overeducated situation in toomuchfreetime. Meanwhile it is shot well beautifully lit drily humorous and manages to make you feel a little sorry for Richard once he loses even though the character deserves it. This is helped mostly by the fact that he doesn't really lose What's Most Important and he didn't know what he wanted in the first place. Great execution of a familiar theme.Now. It is Orson Welles and I! PolarisDiB".

	schema:headline " McKay is simply extraordinary the film flawed but fascinating";
	schema:reviewBody "It's little wonder that Awesome Orson that mercurial selfdestructive titan continues to excite and energise independent movie makers like Tim Robbins who dealt with Welles in the exceptional Cradle Will Rock and Richard Linklater. Fiercely individualistic at a time of rigorous studio control Welles was cut down by jealous rivals blinkered bean counters and a virulent strain of egomania that prevented him playing the Hollywood game. Like Robbins who charted the remarkable story of Welles' 1937 musical of a similar name Linklater focuses on the great man's theatrical work  in this case the update of Julius Caesar that transplanted Shakespeare's work to Fascist Italy and proved the making of its director.When a new project dealing with the Welles legend emerges the first thing you want to know is 'Who's playing Orson?' Who can hope to inhabit the character with those instantly recognisable mannerisms the peculiar speech patterns that snub nose that booming voice? At least 31 actors have taken on the challenge in TV and film including Angus Macfadyen in Cradle Will Rock Jean Guerin in Heavenly Creatures and Vincent D'Onofrio dubbed by Maurice LaMarche in Tim Burton's Ed Wood. Here it's RSC alumnus Christian McKay in his feature debut. Having played Orson in the solo show Rosebud at Edinburgh and off Broadway McKay has had years to hone the characterisation to transcend mimicry and caricature and tap into the very essence of the man.He is absolutely phenomenal.Whether seducing his players via sweetlyspoken flattery or heaping opprobrium on them slotting cherished sections of The Magnificent Ambersons into a radio serial or lamenting his amorphous shallow nature McKay IS Welles. He twinkles yells guffaws postures and roars. And in that one moment of heartbreaking selfawareness his Welles reveals a compulsive need to play the chameleon saying If people can't find you they can't dislike you. It's a remarkable characterisation  and whenever McKay is on screen the film radiates excitement. Sadly that's not the whole story.The movie is pegged as a comingofage tale unfolding against the backdrop of Welles' legendary Caesar. Our comingofager is Zac Efron fresh from the High School Musical films. He's cast as a 17yearold drama student who blags a way into Orson's latest show where he finds romance with ambitious production assistant Claire Danes. At the same time he has half an eye on aspiring playwright Zoe Kazan who hangs around the local museum staring at an urn. Though Efron is quite good these conventional unconvincing essentially uninteresting romantic elements are given equal billing with the Welles material leading to dips in quality and a general listlessness whenever Orson  sorry Christian  is offscreen. That said the scenes where Welles' influence bleeds into the behaviour of impressionable Efron are amusing and wellhandled.Shot at the Gaiety Theatre Douglas in the Isle of Man Me and Orson Welles does a good job of transmitting both the stress and euphoria of life on the stage. Observer critic Philip French said of the film's Caesar Never before have I seen a theatrical production so brilliantly recreated. But while the film does capture the thrill of opening night and the gobsmacking ingenuity of Welles' staging the acting in that playwithinafilm isn't as impressive  with the notable exception of McKay's WellesdoingBrutus. In the film too the rest of the cast appear pretty lacklustre when up against McKay. Ben Chaplin provides moments of pathos and truth as George Coulouris who went on to play Thatcher in Citizen Kane but his performance is often just peculiar while Eddie Marsan appears miscast as Welles' regular backer John Houseman and Leo Bill is a touch onenote. At least James Tupper gives a fair approximation of the young Joseph Cotten playing him as an incorrigible skirtchaser.The film has a decent period atmosphere its lively score packed with familiar period tunes. And though there's a torrent of clumsy and distracting '30s pop culture references in the first 10 minutes the writers are thereafter more discriminating and inventive incorporating a clever nod to The Third Man  with the character of Cotten emerging from the shadows  and an incredibly moving scene with Welles that foreshadows the ruination of his second masterpiece The Magnificent Ambersons.The movie is a long way from being perfect hampered as it is by a conventional romantic subplot that eats up too much screen time. But at its best it's dazzling and in Christian McKay's Orson Welles it boasts one of the best performances of the last 10 years.".

At least 31 actors have taken on the challenge in TV and film including Angus Macfadyen in Cradle Will Rock Jean Guerin in Heavenly Creatures and Vincent D'Onofrio dubbed by Maurice LaMarche in Tim Burton's Ed Wood. Here it's RSC alumnus Christian McKay in his feature debut. Having played Orson in the solo show Rosebud at Edinburgh and off Broadway McKay has had years to hone the characterisation to transcend mimicry and caricature and tap into the very essence of the man.He is absolutely phenomenal.Whether seducing his players via sweetlyspoken flattery or heaping opprobrium on them slotting cherished sections of The Magnificent Ambersons into a radio serial or lamenting his amorphous shallow nature McKay IS Welles. He twinkles yells guffaws postures and roars. And in that one moment of heartbreaking selfawareness his Welles reveals a compulsive need to play the chameleon saying If people can't find you they can't dislike you. It's a remarkable characterisation  and whenever McKay is on screen the film radiates excitement. Sadly that's not the whole story.The movie is pegged as a comingofage tale unfolding against the backdrop of Welles' legendary Caesar. Our comingofager is Zac Efron fresh from the High School Musical films. He's cast as a 17yearold drama student who blags a way into Orson's latest show where he finds romance with ambitious production assistant Claire Danes. At the same time he has half an eye on aspiring playwright Zoe Kazan who hangs around the local museum staring at an urn. Though Efron is quite good these conventional unconvincing essentially uninteresting romantic elements are given equal billing with the Welles material leading to dips in quality and a general listlessness whenever Orson  sorry Christian  is offscreen. That said the scenes where Welles' influence bleeds into the behaviour of impressionable Efron are amusing and wellhandled.Shot at the Gaiety Theatre Douglas in the Isle of Man Me and Orson Welles does a good job of transmitting both the stress and euphoria of life on the stage. Observer critic Philip French said of the film's Caesar Never before have I seen a theatrical production so brilliantly recreated. But while the film does capture the thrill of opening night and the gobsmacking ingenuity of Welles' staging the acting in that playwithinafilm isn't as impressive  with the notable exception of McKay's WellesdoingBrutus. In the film too the rest of the cast appear pretty lacklustre when up against McKay. Ben Chaplin provides moments of pathos and truth as George Coulouris who went on to play Thatcher in Citizen Kane but his performance is often just peculiar while Eddie Marsan appears miscast as Welles' regular backer John Houseman and Leo Bill is a touch onenote. At least James Tupper gives a fair approximation of the young Joseph Cotten playing him as an incorrigible skirtchaser.The film has a decent period atmosphere its lively score packed with familiar period tunes. And though there's a torrent of clumsy and distracting '30s pop culture references in the first 10 minutes the writers are thereafter more discriminating and inventive incorporating a clever nod to The Third Man  with the character of Cotten emerging from the shadows  and an incredibly moving scene with Welles that foreshadows the ruination of his second masterpiece The Magnificent Ambersons.The movie is a long way from being perfect hampered as it is by a conventional romantic subplot that eats up too much screen time. But at its best it's dazzling and in Christian McKay's Orson Welles it boasts one of the best performances of the last 10 years.";

	schema:reviewBody "A showbizmad Jewish schoolkid from New Jersey lands a bitrole almost by accident in Orson Welles' chaoticallyborn but groundbreaking Broadway production in moderndress of Julius Caesar in 1937. That's the premise of Robert Kaplow's 2003 novel one of these uneasy conceits that blur fact and fantasy but which Orson himself with his love of illusion and fakery would probably have endorsed even if he does end up as the 'heavy'. Richard Samuels our hero is also the narrator Holden Caulfield dramatised by Neil Simon if that idea grabs you. Salinger's just died so we'll never know what he thought of it either. Accordingly Richard is cute selfobsessed sexually reticent and a relentless comedian with a smartass reflex in most situations. While rehearsals press ahead under Orson's galvanising tyranny egos clash and crises are wrestled with Richard loses his virginity like clockwork to Sonja the ambitious production assistant he's been fixated on for a whole week. Before taking him to bed she treats him to a teary cringemaking recital of her rackety emotional life hatred of her mother etc etc and you long to stop wasting time with these bewhiskered routines and get back to the Mercury and originality. But it gets worse. Richard thinks he's found True Love and when he finds out that Orson shares Sonja's favours as a matter of course stops being a cute comic and gets all serious wounded and selfrighteous almost coming to blows with the Boy Wonder over his marital infidelity as you would of course who is this kid ? Though they appear to make up afterwards once openingnight has been triumphantly achieved Richard finds himself out on his ear. Disillusioned he must learn to lose before he can win and all the rest of it and giving the whole theatrical experience and Mr. Orson Welles the spiritual finger decides to be a writer instead what a relief. At least he might have better luck with Gretta his earnest little girlfriend who's just had a shortstory published thanks to his Mercury connection it must be said. Out they go sweetly to embrace the Big Apple together as a symbolic bluebird flies up into the sky. You couldn't make it up could you ? Well someone did. And I hope it was meant as a parody.The movie thankfully gets us out of Richard's head and by employing a more slimline approach and eliminating some of the excesses such as Sonja's maudlin confessional makes for a reasonably buoyant entertainment despite some curious casting decisions. Richard is less irritating in transition but alas no more interesting since Zac Efron who occupies his space fails to transmit any discernible enthusiasm for anything around him. He's so cool he's not there. Sonja who's twenty in the book is played by a thirtyyearold actress who doesn't quite capture the image of the company's lustobject. Not that the Mercury boys seem too discriminating. They spend more time in lockerroom conversations than the business in hand. Joe Cotten and Norman Lloyd are playfully offered as a dirtyminded doubleact but George Coulouris stiffnecked and warning of disaster has morphed into Vittorio Gassman with a drawl out of Leslie Phillips. Impossible to swallow if you grew up watching the great veteran in forty years of pictures. But soft who comes here 'tis Christian McKay.McKay is himself a good deal older than Orson was at the time. But then Orson always seemed older than he was anyway. His actual precocious theatrical youth is a veiled object to most of the living world now imagined through the prism of history and his later greater fame something heard in radiorecordings or glimpsed in photos and the newsreel in which he earnestly 'apologised' for scaring America witless with his Men from Mars. It's still a stretch to consider that he was no older than James Dean got to be when he played Charles Foster Kane. And for AMBERSONS his best film potentially I always think why don't today's movers and shakers club together to track down the missing footage once and for all ? he declined to appear as Georgie Minafer preferring to remain unseen as the 'father' of the production. McKay's about the age Orson was when he played Harry Lime his bestloved part an impish monster who can sucker anybody into submission because his talent selfconfidence and sheer cheek seem bigger than the world's. And this is exactly what McKay gives us in his splendidly convincing incarnation he makes you smile with pleasure. And his moments on stage as Brutus are inspired. The Mercury Theatre's first hour of glory is impressively mounted and rendered for all the fun and fooling. It gives the film stature and is worth remembering. The teenagerfantasy stuff is negligible and its pygmydarting won't I think hurt Orson's reputation. He was a magnificent magical maverick  even when he failed  and the world was always more exciting because he was out there somewhere beavering away at his visions and it slumped when he finally left it.Two items of interest 1. I first came across the titlephrase fifty years ago in John Braine's novel Room at the Top when Joe Lampton joins the Thespians. 2.

His Mercury theater is putting on Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar' and 18 year old Richard Samuels Zac Efron manages to get a bit part as Lucius in Welles' new fangled production in modern dress.There isn't much to the plot of 'Me and Orson Welles'. Richard falls for Sonja Jones Claire Danes Orson's production assistant who has no guilt in sleeping her way to the top. She ultimately achieves her goal in getting a date with David O. Selznick the famous Hollywood producer who two years later will produce 'Gone With the Wind'. But along the way she has a momentary fling with Richard who naively believes that their relationship might turn into something. After Richard realizes that Orson is bedding Sonja he takes Joseph Cotton's advice to fight for her and ends up getting on Orson's bad side by accusing him of being an adulterer. Orson the egomaniac that he is will not tolerate any dissent from any members of his cast let alone a neophyte 18 year old and promptly fires Richard. But since opening night is right on the horizon Orson has to momentarily eat crow and flatter Richard so he'll return to the show. Once opening night has come and gone Richard learns that Orson has dispensed with him for good. Richard decides that perhaps he was never meant to be an actor and exits gracefully with a young woman who he had met earlier an aspiring writer who he had helped get published through the assistance and good graces of exlover Sonja.What makes 'Me and Orson Welles' so enjoyable is Christian McKay's performance as the narcissistic thespian. McKay is in his late 30s and looks more like the Orson Welles of the mid to late 40s than the young wunderkind of 1937. Nonetheless if you can overlook the age discrepancy you'll be amazed at just how believable McKay is at portraying Welles when he was just starting out.McKay pulls out all the stops showing us what a 'character' Orson Welles was. He was a man who was bursting with creative ideas always experimenting until he got things right. But the path to perfection was fraught with miscues and the scenes of all the flubbed rehearsals are quite amusing. McKay is brilliant especially when he shows Welles manipulating his actors so that they will bend to his will. It's made clear from the beginning Welles always had to be in control. But occasionally if you did oppose him he would be flexible enough to consider contrary ideas he's willing to incorporate suggestions that he initially rejects from Norman Lloyd who plays Cinna the Poet in Julius Caesar.McKay also does a great job in showing what a great actor Welles was. Particularly impressive is the scene in which McKay has Welles 'improvising' during the radio broadcast. And don't forget how McKayWelles handles Shakespeare in the final scenes where 'Julius Caesar' is finally put on the tremendous raves from the audience are wholly justified. Screenwriter Holly Gent Palmo must be complimented on presenting the many nuances of Welles' largerthanlife character. I loved how the 'sprinkler incident' is foreshadowed by Welles' gut conviction that an earlier calamity can somehow prevent the occurrence of a later and more devastating catastrophe.While it's admirable that Zac Efron chose to advance his career by getting involved in a more sophisticated production such as 'Me and Orson Welles' as opposed to earlier 'lowbrow' efforts such as '17 Again' or 'High School Musical' he doesn't quite have the experience to be totally convincing as the nave and impressionable Richard. Equally forgettable is Claire Danes who is saddled with the nondescript part of the socialclimbing Sonja. Much more to my liking is Ben Chaplin as George Coulouris playing Mark Antony. Chaplin obviously is a classically trained actor who shows his range as both tragedian and comedian he's great as Antony on stage but also as Coulouris who has stage fright before tackling the part.'Me and Orson Welles' is basically a showcase for Christian McKay who has had experience in playing Orson Welles before in a oneman show. If your preference is for great performances as well as theatrical history then check out this entertaining new indie dramedy.".

Chaplin obviously is a classically trained actor who shows his range as both tragedian and comedian he's great as Antony on stage but also as Coulouris who has stage fright before tackling the part.'Me and Orson Welles' is basically a showcase for Christian McKay who has had experience in playing Orson Welles before in a oneman show. If your preference is for great performances as well as theatrical history then check out this entertaining new indie dramedy.";

Victimized by the Amazons the inhabitants of a village including the loyal female villagers decide to fight back and hire a bunch of robbers to teach them how to instruct them in warfare.The acting in this movie is awful except for Benito Stefanelli a good actor whom fans of Spaghetti Westerns should know and who only has a small role in this and Riccardo Pizzuti who is usually seen getting beat up by Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill. The supporting actors are especially bad on guy for example asks a lady if she would marry him but looks into a totally different direction. The Amazon Tribe consists of maybe 30 women most of whom are terrible actresses but at least they're pretty hot and lovely to look at in their miniarmor. However it looks like some of these actresses were replaced by male ! stuntmen in the battle sequences. The movie is also terribly written and the dialogue makes it an unintentional comedy.Apart from its many weaknesses Battle Of The Amazons is quite enjoyable if you're a BMovie fan like myself. As mandatory for an exploitation flick like this there's a lot of sex and violence in it people are mutilated and speared limbs are chopped off and the viewer is entertained with battles whippings gore sex orgies and bared breasts.

	schema:headline " Alfonso Brescia's Italian Amazon trash epic";
	schema:reviewBody "An extremely bad movie about warrior women which still manages to entertain from the sheer absurdity of it all. That and a couple of the fight scenes are pretty good too especially the huge longexpected battle at the end which very nearly lives up to expectations. Sure a lot of Italian cinema is stylish magnificent stuff but they also made their fair share of clunkers. Alfonso Brescia's movie is hindered by exceptionally bad dubbing acting photography choreography lack of script you name it...it's a wonder that this film is watchable at all.Things begin horribly with a really cheesy scene of a man and a woman riding towards each other on horseback in slow motion. What follows is a story involving capture escape torture and eventually betrayal and warfare. This is bad stuff through and through and bad movie fans will no doubt get a kick out of watching it. The best thing that I can say is that there's a lot of action so it never becomes too boring. Sadly the majority of the action scenes take place in the dark so it's impossible to see what's going on. Copious use of dayfornight filming also makes this film look very poor. Forget about any luscious woodland locations  it looks like this film was shot in a copse somewhere and picturesque is far from the word to describe this disappointing dirtylooking locale.The music is cheesy and horrible the acting highly amateurish from most of the cast with only one or two of the leads showing any professionalism whatsoever. Lincoln Tate is okay as the hero and Lucretia Love impossible to believe that this is her real name as the heroine but that's about it. The dubbing is highly amusing and over the top as usual packed with funny lines like murdering bunch of bitches. The Amazons' battle cry sounds like hahohiiiiii!! and is really cheesy! Despite being a film about strong powerful women this still manages to be extremely sexist with one scene involving a lady almost being raped incredibly played for laughs! As I mentioned the action scenes are all right and worth watching especially the huge battle at the end which is where all the budget apparently went. There's a definite martial arts influence with lots of flying kicks headbutts and punches going on. The gore is minimal but there are a few cool scenes of people being repeatedly speared and stabbed. Most incredibly of all though are the many mistakes which are easy to spot while watching. For instance actresses change parts in one scene noticeably by their hair colour changing! Also in the film's major battle at the end it's pretty obvious that the Amazons are actually played by men. Three factors give it away a they wear masks to disguise their faces all of a sudden b they're muscular and c they've got hairy arms and legs. It makes for very surreal entertainment that's for sure. Although a terrible film in most respects BEAUTY OF THE BARBARIAN is a forgotten epic to be sought out by badfilm connoisseurs...if they can be bothered.".

It wasn't necessarily as bad as some of the other movies I watch just unmemorable. You'd think a movie about a band of Amazon warriors that raids a town to kidnap young men for sex slaves would standout more than that. But that's apparently not the case.The movie follows the same plot line we've all seen any number of times. The Amazons raid a small village. Those left in the village fear the Amazons will be back. The villagers hire a band of outlaws to train them to fight. Of course it all leads to a climatic brawl where the villagers come out on top and in the end the outlaws redeem themselves and decide to stay on. Can anyone tell me where they've seen this before? Magnificent Seven maybe? How about Seven Samurai? As I indicated it's been done to death.Battle of the Amazons is a dreary looking affair. It's almost as if the director decided to film the movie through a layer of mud. The acting is generally abysmal. The lone exception is Lucretia Love Is that a cool name or what? who I've begun to notice recently in a few movies. By the way I got a kick out of the fact that Love's character Eraglia was the only Amazon that brought back a female when they raided the village. The final fight scene is pretty much a letdown. I also found it humorous that the Amazons don masks for their climatic battle. This was done so that the females could be replaced by men in wigs. Did they think no one would notice that the shapely Amazons suddenly turned into beefy men? One highlight from Battle of the Amazons for me was the score. Although it would have been more at home in a Spaghetti Western the music was quite nice.".

Now there's some sort of premise about a god the amazons worship that causes them to don masks while heading into battle but seriously this is just a ploy to cover for the fact that during the big battle the amazons are all played by stuntmen! Add to this insanity they don't even pad the men out the bonus of everyone jumping at each other from hidden trampolines and screaming in a bizarre voice and you can't help but enjoy it.

Furthermore it was intolerably obvious to those of us who managed to sit somewhat  patiently until the conclusion of this film that numerous women's roles i.e. those parts demanding feats of strength or masculine agility were most apparently played by men in other words little time thought and effort were given for the proper and realistic disguise of men assuming the parts of Amazons to have them appear somewhat like women.  Thirdly a poorly conceived storyline seemed to have been concocted only to serve as an excuse for provocativelyclad physically wellbuilt attractive women to appear on the wide screen.  Yet I suppose if the acting had been  a bit more plausible and a director interested more in directing than in misdirecting had been employed the plot of this miserably produced film may have actually become more comprehensible and possibly even appreciated.   On a scale of one to ten I gave this film a three merely because certain battle scenes appeared to have some degree of plausibility.

	schema:text "    In the early 1970s Sixto Rodriguez was a Detroit folksinger who had a shortlived recording career with only two well received but nonselling albums. Unknown to Rodriguez his musical story continued in South Africa where he became a pop music icon and inspiration for generations. Long rumored there to be dead by suicide a few fans in the 1990s decided to seek out the truth of their hero's fate. What follows is a bizarrely heartening story in which they found far more in their quest than they ever hoped while a Detroit construction laborer discovered that his lost artistic dreams came true after all.";

	schema:reviewBody "Sixto Rodriguez a little known American folkrock singersongwriter in the tradition of Bob Dylan and Cat Stevens released two albums in the early 1970s Cold Fact and Coming From Reality but failed to achieve any popularity. Though praised by critics his haunting songs about love and loss drugs and politics such as I Wonder Cause and Sugar Man should have been hits but for some reason were not. After a minor tour in Australia that brought neither success nor recognition he was dropped from his record label and was not publicly heard from again.Winner of the Jury Prize and the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival Swedish filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul's moving documentary Searching for Sugar Man investigates the life of Rodriguez who grew up in a rundown working class area of Detroit Michigan and worked mostly as a manual laborer singing at night in small smokefilled bars. A friend who remembers him at the time says There was something mysterious about him. He looked like a drifter. The film demonstrates Rodriguez' striking presence using a mix of songs interviews with those who knew him or knew about him animation and archival photos.Though no one knows exactly how his albums somehow made their way to South Africa and circulated among white Afrikaans musicians. All of this led to a growing mystique about an artist that no one knew anything about. Rumors began to circulate that during an unsuccessful concert he shot himself in the head or died from a drug overdose but no one knew for sure how he died. The film begins when Cape Town record shop owner and music fan Stephen Segerman whose nickname Sugar Man mirrors one of Rodriguez' most famous songs meets music journalist Craig BartholomewStrydom and the two undertake to investigate what had happened to him.We find out that his album Cold Fact was distributed on a small South African label that one of his songs Sugar Man was banned on the governmentrun radio station for its drug references and that the antiestablishment lyrics of his songs such as The Establishment Blues struck a responsive chord with the growing student involvement in the antiapartheid movement and led indirectly to the Afrikaner protest musicians of the '80s. When Segerman and Bartholomew begin their investigation to uncover the mystery of Sixto Rodriguez they take a cue from Watergate and decide to follow the money. As each layer is unpeeled it only adds another mystery.Though his albums are said to have sold half a million records speculation is rife with questions about what happened to the money and an interview with Clarence Avant the boss of Motown adds more heat than light. What the music detectives eventually find is not only surprising but extremely poignant and it is best for viewers to find this out for themselves. The film is an odyssey of discovery even selfdiscovery that is a profoundly inspiring celebration of a man and his music. More than just a film about music and musicians however it is about the human condition. Though it reveals its secrets slowly when it hits you it is with an astonishing burst of power that you can feel in your bones. Searching for Sugar Man is one of the best films of the year.".

Unlike The Jester this guy never sold out and walked the talk until the bitter end. I've always believed the world's best talent goes unrecognized most of the time but the story of Sixto Rodriguez puts that theory into the true category once and for all and I will never doubt it again.

The sound tracks are really wonderful and take you back to the 60s and 70s. Another interesting facet of this movie is the exploration of the overthrow of Apartheid. Many who embraced the music of Rodriquez were Africaaners who were looking for change and a better life for everyone in their country. You come out of this movie believing in a better world.".

He's not the first person to be given the boot in his hometown the Bible has something to say on this subject but upon listening to the wonderful soundtrack of this film it is a sad commentary. There's plenty of humor here as well in this tale of parallel universes one in which Rodriquez is Elvis and another where he's scarcely a blip on the radar. The film begins as an investigation by curious fans seeking to learn about the whereabouts of Rodriquez and what may have happened to him. The stories circulating about him are not promising but they are undaunted and continue to search for answers. I think everyone who sees Searching For Sugar Man will be thankful that they did.".

The bottom line is It is a story that is too real poignant and farfetched to exist anywhere on a writer's board or in a screenplay this is why documentaries will never die and they will always have a reserved place in the realm of cinema films of fiction and artistry just cannot pierce the depth that this one finds. It is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen possibly the greatest. I cried throughout the picture. A mustsee.

	schema:headline " A music documentary with a difference";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a music biography with a bit of a difference. Normally when we settle down to watch one of these we know in advance what the artist's music is like. Even if we are not committed fans we usually at least know something. In this documentary this will simply not be the case for the vast majority of folks who decide to watch it. For this reason Searching for Sugar Man is somewhat unusual.Its subject the singersongwriter Sixto Rodriguez recorded a couple of critically praised but commercially disastrous albums in the early 70's. He was quickly dropped by his record label and then basically vanished from the public eye for over quarter of a century. Rumours of his onstage suicide circulated as fact. Where the story becomes a little unexpected is that through word of mouth he became massive in South Africa of all places. In the apartheid years his music developed a following that rivalled bands like the Rolling Stones. His lyrics hit a note with white liberals there and his albums became antiestablishment classics. Many of the people who would make important contributions to overturning the apartheid regime were influenced by Rodriguez. But the thing is he knew absolutely nothing of his fame and popularity there. He received no royalties at all for the 500000 albums he sold in South Africa. When interviewed his label boss Clarence Avant gets a little shifty when asked about this. It seems that Rodriguez had been dealt a somewhat bum hand.The second act of the story began when one of the South Africans who loved him discovered when speaking to an American friend that Rodriguez albums were impossible to buy in the States. This was something of a revelation as up until this point it was generally assumed that he must have been a peer of Bob Dylan and just as popular. This led to a quest to discover more about the man it led to the incredible discovery that he was still alive and living a modest life in Detroit with his daughters. The man himself was utterly unaware of his cultural impact in South Africa. The South African's subsequently organised concerts back home and so Rodriguez went there in the late 90's. A nobody at home there he played to crowds of tens of thousands of people of all ages in the spectrum. They all seemed to know his records off by heart too. It was a revelation to witness this strange but uplifting story arc.It's difficult to really know why Rodriguez never made it at the time. Many now classic acts such as Nick Drake never made it during their recording careers either. Sometimes a combination of things just conspires against a musician and Rodriguez seems to have been a victim of this circumstance. His music certainly is good  and there are nice animated segments to go along with some of his songs here  but it's difficult to say how good on one viewing. Certainly there were a lot of singersongwriters in the early 70's on the back of Dylan. But what makes this documentary so interesting is not just the discovery of something hidden and good but also the realisation that a mass cultural happening could occur on another side of the world without it's figurehead knowing the slightest thing about it. It's overall a fascinating story and one for all music fans.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a music biography with a bit of a difference. Normally when we settle down to watch one of these we know in advance what the artist's music is like. Even if we are not committed fans we usually at least know something. In this documentary this will simply not be the case for the vast majority of folks who decide to watch it. For this reason Searching for Sugar Man is somewhat unusual.Its subject the singersongwriter Sixto Rodriguez recorded a couple of critically praised but commercially disastrous albums in the early 70's. He was quickly dropped by his record label and then basically vanished from the public eye for over quarter of a century. Rumours of his onstage suicide circulated as fact. Where the story becomes a little unexpected is that through word of mouth he became massive in South Africa of all places. In the apartheid years his music developed a following that rivalled bands like the Rolling Stones. His lyrics hit a note with white liberals there and his albums became antiestablishment classics. Many of the people who would make important contributions to overturning the apartheid regime were influenced by Rodriguez. But the thing is he knew absolutely nothing of his fame and popularity there. He received no royalties at all for the 500000 albums he sold in South Africa. When interviewed his label boss Clarence Avant gets a little shifty when asked about this. It seems that Rodriguez had been dealt a somewhat bum hand.The second act of the story began when one of the South Africans who loved him discovered when speaking to an American friend that Rodriguez albums were impossible to buy in the States. This was something of a revelation as up until this point it was generally assumed that he must have been a peer of Bob Dylan and just as popular. This led to a quest to discover more about the man it led to the incredible discovery that he was still alive and living a modest life in Detroit with his daughters. The man himself was utterly unaware of his cultural impact in South Africa. The South African's subsequently organised concerts back home and so Rodriguez went there in the late 90's. A nobody at home there he played to crowds of tens of thousands of people of all ages in the spectrum. They all seemed to know his records off by heart too. It was a revelation to witness this strange but uplifting story arc.It's difficult to really know why Rodriguez never made it at the time. Many now classic acts such as Nick Drake never made it during their recording careers either. Sometimes a combination of things just conspires against a musician and Rodriguez seems to have been a victim of this circumstance. His music certainly is good  and there are nice animated segments to go along with some of his songs here  but it's difficult to say how good on one viewing. Certainly there were a lot of singersongwriters in the early 70's on the back of Dylan. But what makes this documentary so interesting is not just the discovery of something hidden and good but also the realisation that a mass cultural happening could occur on another side of the world without it's figurehead knowing the slightest thing about it. It's overall a fascinating story and one for all music fans.";

This is inspiring stuff a moving feelgood movie with a detective plot as a record store owner and a journalist hunt down the enigmatic Rodriguez whose album Cold Fact made him an anonymous superstar in South Africa.This is a great piece of manipulative filmmaking but as a documentary it asks more questions than it answers and never lets the facts stand in the way of a good story. First up we are told Rodriguez was more famous than the Rolling Stones in South Africa artistically his only peer was Bob Dylan and he was a leading inspiration in the struggle against apartheid. Come on. Really? Then based on unsubstantiated guesstimates from half a million to millions of album sales the film asks where the royalties went but doesn't follow through. They interview Rodriguez who surely could have answered this question along with many others but we see little of the man himself except for wistful shots of him looking out a window while his daughters and the South Africans do most of the talking.I wanted to see Rodriguez but this becomes more a story of the South Africans and their feeble attempts to track him down. These included putting his picture on milk cartons and spreading rumors of his selfimmolation on stage which sounded more like attempts to promote the myth ahead of his tours of South Africa. Also the movie implies Rodriguez was unheard of outside South Africa but Cold Fact was also popular in Australia where Rodriguez toured in the late 70s and then with Midnight Oil. I know I was a fan and had a copy of the album as did most of my friends. We are also told he survived his life after music by working as a demolition man. Nice hard luck story but an internet search reveals he was also a teacher and social worker and the movie quickly passes over his graduation from university.Rodriguez was a unique talent I loved his music and this film does a great job of giving this humble man the recognition he deserves. It is a moving cinema experience and well worth seeing but this is faction as much as fact which is carefully excised to fit the myth.".

In fact by the end of the 70s he was enormous in Australia and his popularity in South Africa most likely stems from his success there. Rodriguez actually sold five times as many records in Australia than he did in South Africa.

The main characters were welldeveloped each with their own quirks and there were some unexpected twists that helped move the plot along.Stephen Campbell Moore the actor who plays the lead Adam Symes is a real find. He carries the movie beautifully and I wouldn't be surprised if he became a huge star. Even though Moore does fine on his own you have to give credit to Simon Callow King of Anatolia Jim Broadbent the drunk Major and others in the supporting cast for mastering their oddball roles. Furthermore the costume designer deserves an Oscar.I was a bit disappointed with the ending or at least the scenes leading up to the end. The film starts out like a carnival ride and runs out of gas near the end. But like all good carnival rides once you finish you want to get back on. That's the way I felt about Bright Young Things. I can't wait to see it in the theater again.".

I know I'm not the first person to say this but it bears repetition Fenella Woolgar is a revelation in this film conveying the insouciance of the upper class effortlessly and the scene after the orgy with the stern family is priceless.

A bittersweet love story interwoven with a hilarious array of eccentric English upper class characters from the early 20th century.Watch out for many faces in small but unforgettable parts I especially adored Dan Aykroyd's Michael Sheen's and Jim Broadbent's characters. Fenella Woolgar was also perfect and immensely likable in her role as the dazed and confused but eternally cheerful and optimistic eccentric. Emily Mortimer was flawless as the English rose stuck between marrying money or sticking with her penniless true love. There was palpable chemistry between her and Stephen Campbell Moore's character which made the whole story work for me.And of course Peter O'Toole steals the film with barely five minutes of total screen time but that's the kind of talent he was gifted with. Watch it if you enjoy witty dialogue period pieces and don't you dare miss it if you're a Stephen Fry fan. He is a very funny man and his direction which remains always affectionate towards the characters he's portraying in his movie was impressive given he's better known as an actor and writer.If you liked this movie you would also likeEnchanted April  A Month By The Lake  Widows Peak  In The Bleak Midwinter  A Room With A ViewAll of these are in my list of top ten favourite films of all time. Bright Young Things just misses the mark to join them but it's definitely in my top twenty.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bright Young Things is a mostly effective satire with some jarring seriousness thrown in of Masterpiece Theater Jazz Age costume dramas for its first seveneighths. Set in the same period as Gosford Park its conflicts are just within the sexual and financial eccentricities of the emptyheaded leisure and wannabe leisure class where titles don't match income or outflow.It is more of a visual evocation of Noel Coward songs and incorporates some of his numbers as well as original soundalike songs. The frolics have some similarities to the simultaneous Weimar Republic portrayed in Cabaret. Stephen Campbell Moore as the protagonist is almost too good in his film debut as his character's captivatingly serious eyes and demeanor conflict with his insouciant company particularly Emily Mortimer as his dispassionate lover though that justifies the stuckon denouement that even without having read the Evelyn Waugh book this is adapted from Vile Bodies I can tell didn't have this too neat and comeuppance tyingup. The most pointed parts of the movie are its acid documentation of the birth of the tabloid gossip press including Dan Ackroyd as a Canadian press baron with a more than passing resemblance to today's lords of Fleet Street. James McAvoy is very good as a more upperclass betraying precursor to his scandalseeking scion reporter in the miniseries State of Play and manages to seem like a real person unlike so many of the characters who are just types or plot conveniences. The production design and costumes are delightful.".

Grant and Margaret Tyzack recognizable. Fry appears as a chauffeur.Moore and Mortimer are solid as young things but Fenella Woolgar as Agatha is the standout. She's awesome in the part of the drugged out socialite who ends up in an asylum. Woolgar has several memorable scenes and droops about being smashingly bored. Her race car scene is a scream. David Tennant is the repulsive Ginger Michael Sheen is the queeny Miles Lisa Dillon is the social wannabe and Alec Newman is the very odd race driver.Only real complaint is that the ending is VERY long and drawn out. And even though a few loose ends are tied up it seems padded and interminable.

As such it is reminiscent of His Girl Friday 1940 with its legendary speed of comedy delivery. The difference with His Girl Friday the speed of the comedy delivery is applied to loquaciousness with a bit of slap stick. Director Stephen Fry of Bright Young Things on the other hand utilises speed to articulate the decadence of the period. As such he is affective in his endeavour of making his point of a decadent aristocracy.The depressing aspect of the film is that the aristocracy are portrayed as decadent party animals unlike the poor who in their pursuit of escaping their worries are in today's post modern Britain often labelled as 'feckless' by the tabloid press. But as the impoverished poor struggled to feed themselves across Europe during the interwar period the aristocracy idly carried on without social conscience or obligation to responsibility. Such decadence at the expense of the poor contributed towards the rise of extreme politics in Europe during the 1920s.Contributing to the masses' public perception of the idle rich decadence of the interwar period was the tabloid press. The press baron in the film is shown as suppressing the realities of the issues affecting the ordinary people of Britain for profit and thereby concealing truth.While Fry adeptly captures the decadence of the 20s in Bright Young Things Peter O'Toole steels the film with his outstanding satirising of the stereotypical English eccentric. As the eccentric of the upper classes O'Toole's character Colnol Blout is the epitome of English two faced diplomacy of the ruling classes. The example being when he writes a cheque out for 1000 to help his prospective soninlaw to marry his daughter when he signs it in the name of Charlie Chaplin. A typical English snub no less!Excellent film well acted and brilliantly directed.".

	schema:headline " Waugh A Waste";
	schema:reviewBody "Bright Young Things is a comedy that's never funny a period piece that doesn't know what period it's in and a party film that leaves you with the hangover.When writerdirector Stephen Fry decided to make an adaptation of an Evelyn Waugh novel he could have done himself a favor and not adapted Vile Bodies. It's an episodic satire on the lives of a group of London club kids in the late 1920s that attempts to elicit laughter from the nasty ways they are run to ground by the world around them. The characters aren't meant for any deeper emotional investment than lab rats though Fry seems to believe otherwise.At the center of the story in both novel and film is young Adam Stephen Campbell Moore who at the start of our story has lost his prized manuscript and is desperately trying to find new sources of funding with which to marry his lover Nina Emily Mortimer. Opportunity comes in the form of an offer from publisher Lord Monomark Dan Aykroyd who wants Adam's help tearing the lid off the young idle and rich.I put Seignior Mussolini on the front page no one buys a copy he laments. But a picture of one of your set in a nightclub I can't print enough copies.The problem with both the novel and the film is this interesting idea is dropped almost before it begins in favor of a number of other outrageous episodes which seem to act on the principle that anything can be made merry provided it moves fast enough. Like a strange major who makes off with some money Adam wanted to bet on a longshot horse. Or a party that winds up finding themselves in the Prime Minister's residence. Or a car race that loses a wayward driver. All of this is drawn out as if it were funny merely by being incongruous.The film is worse on a few counts. First Fry by necessity condenses the story but is at pains to include almost every character that appears in the book as a way of facilitating assorted cameos that run from extraneous Richard E. Grant as an angry Jesuit to sad John Mills as a mute coke sniffer. Second he invests his version with an elegiac sadness that feels totally out of place in the second half. Nothing says comedy like a man sticking his head in an oven or another tearfully discovering his homosexual lifestyle exposed.Even the main romance a matter of crass opportunism in the book is presented as a kind of real love story even heroic as the Roaring '20s zip suddenly ahead to Dunkirk and the Blitz. Fry doesn't seem to trust either Waugh's wit or his own to make Bright Young Things work on comedic grounds or else he really thinks the characters worth celebrating. The result is a doubleddown waste of our time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen this film at the cinema and thoroughly enjoyed it I purchased it on DVD and then read the book so as to better judge whether the comments that the film was an exceedingly loose adaptation were true. It is certainly true that Fry hasn't stuck to the narrative strictly but the changes he made in the name of good cinema were overwhelmingly the right ones and he actually managed to bring forward some entertaining background characters and relegate some fairly tedious ones. For example Lord Monomark who is a Canadian Newspaper magnate shamelessly based on Lord Beverbrook is rairly mentioned in the book but is superbly played by Dan Ackroyd in the film whilst the PM Walter Outrage who features heavily in Waughs novel is barely mentioned in the film and rightly so as the character in the novel is a complicated amalgamation of contemporary politics i.e Ramsay Mcdonald and Bonar Lawthat even I having studied the period extensively found heavy going. Also whilst the ending is contrived to be too happy it is a marginal improvement on the novel in my opinion which doesn't seem to conclude the book very well. Overall a superb film with excellent production values and peerless period feel for which Stephen Fry should be commended. I just hope that he has a stab at at adapting Decline and Fall which is another excellent Waugh novel.".

	schema:reviewBody "A most notable characteristic of this film is that it rather zanily merges the 1920's with the 1930's. That historical distortion may seem a slight defect to some viewers choosing to concentrate on a broader stage involving the upper class in its last throes of excess but for me it destroys the underlying plot. The years before the Great Depression  the Roaring 20's  were sui generis. Moving everything forward to events as late as 1940 is a forced element that simply fails.Otherwise there are some bright young moments here. Character actors do indeed steal the show even if some are given throwaway roles. If only there were better and more believable development of various interactions between the leads it would make for compelling drama but we are treated instead to campy olio resolving itself into a strange conclusion somewhat surreal. For example the business between Adam and Ginger having to do with money as WWII rages on is misplaced farce  even if the audience assumes a generous disposition of credulity.Little wonder outsiders looking in have a difficult time with this film not to mention us history buffs.".

	schema:reviewBody "As one of the best assets humanity can boast to count among itself Stephen Fry has delighted the world across a vast array of media firmly establishing himself as one of my very favourite entertainers. How then you ask could it have taken me so unforgivably long to sample his Bright Young Things?Having just penned the novel from which the film takes its name Adam Symes is crestfallen to have it taken from him by customs as contraband literature. He returns to his life of yuppie indulgence if indeed the film's '30s'40s setting will permit the usage of that term where he is variously delighted and disappointed by the tidelike fortunes of his financial situation and the uncertainty concerning his ability to wed his beloved Nina.Beginning with an expository reporter attempting to gain access to a lascivious and drug fuelled party Bright Young Things launches us into the wild party lifestyle of its central cast of characters. The cocaine and absinthe combinations proclaimed by Nina as boring impress upon us the extent of the interwar indulgence of the London youth. Things are somewhat slow to start though the positively delightful and flowery banter of Fry's script keeps us both amused and entranced by the language of the era. Humour comes spouting from the supporting cast the likes of Fenella Woolgar and Michael Sheen lend more laughs than the main acts themselves who are generally left to present the dramatic front of the movie. Without doubt the film's best factor is the scene in which the hopeful Symes visits his fatherinlawtobe a crackpot lunatic played splendidly by Peter O' Toole. As the running time finds itself elapsed the drama begins to more firmly announce its presence to us the stakes yet again raised and the outcome looking ever more bleak. The problem is that this never reaches a sufficient and acceptable zenith. No point of conclusion is reached wherein the characters seem to transform beyond the horrid snobs they began life before our eyes as a shame given the potential this may have had. Not that is to say that the characters are unlikeable. In spite of their vices they grow upon us and become endeared to us though we look on like disappointed parents hopefully awaiting the time when they will learn the folly of their ways and grow up a time the film never presents or at least not expressly enough. I understand the novel on which the film is based takes this more desired route the film's distance from this perhaps the product of Fry's wishes to carve his own story. In any case despite the slight disappointment of the lack of redemption the film is consistent in its humorous and dramatic elements which blend together to give a decent slice of entertainment.Almost certainly less good than it could and should have been Bright Young Things feels like it fell at the last hurdle. That said it was never at the front of the race. A perfectly competent debut from Mr Fry one cannot disagree that the film holds its own.".

Bright Young Things has possibly the noisiest and most unrelenting soundtrack of the year with so much cutting between shots that I began to feel that I had whiplash. This is an exercise style over content but the style really isn't much to write home about.Bright Young Things is one of those wretched literary adaptations where the writerdirector is desperate to say oh it might be a period piece but how little things have changed. And Fry takes every opportunity to underline this point. Over and over and over again. Watching Sir John Mills's character snorting coke actually it wasn't really a character more of a cypher or stereotype like virtually all the other roles here was one of the more embarrassing screen moments of 2003.The film has no sense of narrative drive or pace. It's difficult to either follow or care. Unfortunately newcomer Stephen Campbell Moore who is as close as the film gets to a main protagonist is a dull uncharismatic actor. Michael Sheen overacts and looks embarrassed in a ridiculous role. However there are star turns from Fenella Woolgar and James McAvoy who manage to rivet even when everything else is flailing around them.Fatally the film has absolutely no sense of period whatsoever and seems littered with borrowings from across the 20th century. Waugh's novel was about the Jazz Age of the 1920s. Fry's world is a kind of incorrectly jazzy 30s with added 21st century haircuts. The final scenes set during the Second World War seem lame and are of course simply wrong  the novel was written in 1930.The film is illconceived and poorly executed. I had always assumed that Stephen Fry would be the right man to adapt Waugh but here he proves that he doesn't have the least idea what makes good cinema let alone a convincing adaptation.".

However he fails so miserably in his directorial debut that we left after the first 15 minutes of the film. The movie's opening sequence is meant to demonstrate the wild madcap exuberance of rich young adults in the 1930's. The wildness is forced and the exuberance is glaringly unrealistic. You can almost hear Fry saying All right people back to work. Dance wildly laugh loudly be carefree. Two more scenesat an English customs office and in the office of a newspaper tycoonare so amateurishlydirected that we couldn't believe we were sitting in atheater watching a commercial movie.. We also couldn'tbelieve that Stephen Fry one of our favorite actors couldn't see the disaster unfolding and somehow in some way figure out how to save the film.After about 15 minutes I whispered Are you seeing what I'mseeing?

	onyx:emotionText "Bright Young Things 2003 directed by Stephen Fry demonstrates that an extraordinary actor may fail as director and scriptwriter.Stephen Fry is one of my favorite actors. However he fails so miserably in his directorial debut that we left after the first 15 minutes of the film. The movie's opening sequence is meant to demonstrate the wild madcap exuberance of rich young adults in the 1930's. The wildness is forced and the exuberance is glaringly unrealistic. You can almost hear Fry saying All right people back to work. Dance wildly laugh loudly be carefree. Two more scenesat an English customs office and in the office of a newspaper tycoonare so amateurishlydirected that we couldn't believe we were sitting in atheater watching a commercial movie.. We also couldn'tbelieve that Stephen Fry one of our favorite actors couldn't see the disaster unfolding and somehow in some way figure out how to save the film.After about 15 minutes I whispered Are you seeing what I'mseeing? Within 30 seconds we were on our way out the door.We haven't walked out of a movie in years. Both of us believe that out of respect for the director and the actors we shouldstay to the end of a movie .

	schema:reviewBody "Having read a part in Evelyn Waugh's The Loved One in college it's nice to recognize the sharp bite of the curmudgeonly Waugh wit in this latterday film adaptation of his Vile Bodies. This romp through the partying smart set of 1930s Britain's from the viewpoint of a budding young writer coopted by a broadly drawn caricature of Lord Beaverbrook played by Dan Aykroyd typecast for once as a loud Canadian into the world of sensational yellow gossip journalism is wonderful.The more obtund contemporary film adaptations of Waugh made in murky black and white converge on this almost Platonic ideal of a movie based on a Waugh story. The cinematography's splendid the performances crisp and the pace taut. Emily Mortimer is properly reptilian as the desirable shallow and fickle loveobject Nina Blount Stephen Campbell Moore earnest and sympathetic as striving and ineptly conniving Adam FenwickSymes the cast in general bring Waugh's vision of the wicked vapid high society scene of the 1930s to life adroitly.Dan Aykroyd revels in the Beaverbrookbased character whaling away at the levers of power David Tennant the current incarnation of Doctor Who at this writing is great as the obtuse but wealthy Ginger Peter O'Toole does a nice cameo as Nina's father and the peripatetic Jim Broadbent puts in yeoman service. Stockard Channing excels as a sociopathic rich American every Waugh story has at least one. Her character Mrs. Melrose Ape is an Aimee Semple MacPhersontype idiotic fundamentalist hypocrite touring wicked prewar Europe with a troupe of holy young girl singers putting the Word of God to hokey rhyme. The words of the song Ain't No Flies on the Lamb of God may have been written by director Stephen Fry but they are wicked satire in the Waughian spirit. The vignettes of party life play nasty amusing havoc with the social elite of prewar Britain  wellplaced clergymen sniff diffidently at cocaine and drink authoritatively while His Majesty's statesmen are set adrift after their wives and daughters work their ruin in completely unnecessary scandals created at lascivious parties. Tales of what goes on when the high and the mighty party hard gives the simmering anger of British veterans and working people a palpable focus and outlet  news of those vile bodies sporting about on unearned money and in the arms of powerful sinners is central to the plot the main character is just one of three people who work their own ruin while writing about the dissolution of others for publisher Dan Aykroyd's newspaper empire.Some folks here in IMDb remark about the characters not being as sympathetic as they had hoped. This betrays a lack of experience with the writing of Evelyn Waugh who wrote caricatures not characters.Waugh's savage wit spares few of the people who populate his stories Waugh is the antiromantic Jack the Ripper the Siva the Destroyer of British high society's pretensions down to the scene in which Adam FenwickSymes and Ginger dicker over how much Nina Blount's affection is worth in pounds shillings and pence after all Symes's inn bill had to be paid. Waugh based one of his most hateful villains The Man Who Liked Dickens on his own father  a very recognizable portrait of a venal and worthless old bastard that stunned those who knew Waugh perhaps it stunned those who knew Waugh well less than it did the others... .This is perhaps the least acerbic of Waugh's stories. Stephen Fry works magic in bringing it to vibrant entertaining life. It's Waugh for those who can't cope with Waugh's usual demolition of every character in his stories. If you've never seen a movie based on a Waugh story before maybe this is a good start to his work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Stephen Fry making his directorial debut is a little bit like watching a toddler the first time he rides a bike without stabilisers. Things are dangerously wobbly to begin with then smooth out nicely as selfbelief grows before everything comes crashing down due to overconfidence. Based on Evelyn Waugh's 'Vile Bodies' this film chronicles the debauched lifestyle of a group of paradoxically penniless rich kids i.e. they're mostly lords and ladies but have no visible means of income in a Britain of the 30s that would be unrecognisable to all but the impoverished aristocracy. This is a rarefied world that no doubt existed and seemed real to the likes of Waugh but which is unrecognisable to the majority of British people. Without doubt however this movie in its representation of that period and lifestyle provides us with an absorbing and entertaining tale.Apart from our hero Adam FenwickSymes Stephen Campbell Moore another dbutant giving a good account of himself the characters in this film aren't so much introduced as wander in like party guests you drunkenly met in another room ten minutes ago. They all share a propensity for decadence and the affectation of declaring most everything to be a frantic bore and are all without exception empty shells. We've seen it all before in the likes of Brideshead Revisited and The Sun Also Rises but Fry manages to keep us hooked despite the clumsy manner in which he films those opening scenes. Perhaps it's because of the sumptuous production design that captures the feel of these bright young things' hedonistic lifestyle or perhaps it's because of the amiably random manner in which Fry begins to pull the threads of his story together. Either way despite Fry's apparent determination to use every scene transition known to the film world and to make use of at least a little snippet from each of a multitude of cameras used to shoot many scenes the story manages to hold your attention and drag you along with it leaving you asking yourself why you're interested in a bunch of characters who are all about as deep as lemon peel.The story and the characters follow a predictable arc but Fry fills the film with enough detail and ingenuity to at least keep us entertained. A host of famous faces provide a series of cameos that last little more than seconds in some cases  and this is without doubt the only film in which you will see the redoubtable Sir John Mills snorting cocaine. Fenella Woolgar outshines everybody in her scenes as the agreeably dippy cokehead Agatha who brings a whole new meaning to the term 'powdering one's nose' and eventually parties herself into an insane asylum. In a role that strays into parody every now and then she manages to provide a brief glimpse of a lost soul behind the party face and her 'dream' speech pretty much sums up the entire social scene in which the characters are embroiled. James McAvoy as the illfated Lord Balcairn AKA Mr. Chatterbox also stands out in one of few sympathetic roles.The film loses its momentum in the final act when Fry moves from adapting Waugh's story to altering it completely and we are left with an ending that is not only contrived but stretches credibility beyond its limits. Having managed to have steered a path that at least avoided conventionality in terms of plot Fry suddenly makes a complete aboutturn and presents us with a finale that stands out as a monumental piece of misjudgement. Perhaps Waugh's ending was too downbeat for the backers. It's a shame if that is the case because it will mean that Fry most likely compromised himself. Somewhere down the line someone needs to show an ounce of integrity and fight for an ending that is true to the nature of the story rather than compromising with a soapopera climax that tarnishes the good work that has gone before.Bottom line BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS is a worthy directorial debut from Stephen Fry and while it's no classic has a lot going for it. It's probably not worth seeking out but if it happens to cross your path it's definitely worth watching. Just be sure to stop watching after the war scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "The more things change the more they stay the same. London in the 1930's and the social scene is bustling. Adam is a writer of ambition but when his book gets confiscated by HM Customs he finds himself writing for Lord Monomark's paper as gossip columnist Mr Chatterbox. This involves him going to as many parties as possible and mixing with the rich bright young things of London society. While Adam attempts to get the money together to marry his girlfriend Nina he follows the ups and downs of this group.I have never read the book from which this came so I only came to this film as one comes to any other film and therefore had no expectations of what it should be or would be. The film follows the fortunes of the 1930's equivalent of the It crowd  those without jobs who seem to live of money from somewhere to just continually party and appear in the papers. As such the narrative relies heavily on the characters and I must confess I didn't find many of them interesting enough to really engage me. That said the plot still works because the characters are lively and flamboyant enough to be interesting and amusing. The multitalented Fry takes pleasure in showing us how things are no different now than they were then  the public gobbles up tabloid gossip the society parties are full of outrageous behaviour sex and drug taking. With a modern eye it is fun to watch this although it perhaps isn't enough to make the whole film.Fry's debut as director shows him able as such even if some of his touches are a bit clumsy. The cast help him out greatly by delivering the goods from his script. Moore has the straightest character and the harder job of holding the narrative together but he does well and makes for an quite engaging character. Mortimer isn't used as well as I would have liked although she herself is pretty good. The rest of the cast are caricatures and outrageous types who perhaps don't add depth to the film but certainly make it fun. Tennant is good although the deliveries of Sheen and Woolgar naturally dominate. Quality is deep within the film even if some of Callow Channing Aykroyd Mills and Grant are barely in it long enough to even be classed as cameos! Broadbent is a delight as a permanently sloshed major.Overall then an enjoyable film that makes for interesting viewing the way that modern society is reflected in 1930's society. The characters make for an OK story even if a lot of it is on the surface and very much of the moment which I suppose might have been the point and it is enjoyable even if it isn't that memorable.".

Tennant is good although the deliveries of Sheen and Woolgar naturally dominate. Quality is deep within the film even if some of Callow Channing Aykroyd Mills and Grant are barely in it long enough to even be classed as cameos! Broadbent is a delight as a permanently sloshed major.Overall then an enjoyable film that makes for interesting viewing the way that modern society is reflected in 1930's society. The characters make for an OK story even if a lot of it is on the surface and very much of the moment which I suppose might have been the point and it is enjoyable even if it isn't that memorable.";

And though the movie Chicago paints the grim depiction of the roaring twenties Bright Young Things goes the extra mile to in all its reckless ways.

One of the most spectacular performances in the film is that by Fenella Woolgar whose portrayal of an elitist aristocratic Bohemian who eventually goes mad is done to utter perfection. Fry was able to do this film and get these amazing performances because he really does know this kind of people and he and his actor friends yes they were all friends including Sir John Mills who does not speak were able to finetune the performances to absolute perfection. The old saying 'It takes one to know one' can in this case be altered to 'It takes one to show one.'

Now that is not to say that McConaughey hasn't done some great movies. For every Ghosts of Girlfriend's Past Sahara and Failure to Launch there are We Are Marshall and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Lincoln Lawyer is luckily part of the later group and reminds us that McConaughey can carry movie without having to take off his shirt in every scene.Lincoln Lawyer is a thrilling drama about a cocky and smooth defense attorney Mick Haller played by McConaughey who represents a highprofile client on charges of attempted murder. But as new evidence continues to pile on Mick starts to grow suspicious that perhaps his client isn't telling him everything. With twists and turns at every corner Lincoln Lawyer keeps you guessing till the very end.With the help of that distinct country voice and southern charm McConaughey takes the movie to another level with this portrayal of the fasttalking lawyer. With the role of Mick McConaughey is actually given a chance to show off a range of emotions that will truly surprise viewers. Mcconaughey doesn't carry this alone Lincoln Lawyer gets some great acting from the likes of William H. Macy Michael Pena John Leguizamo Josh Lucas and Marisa Tomei. The only black sheep of his movie comes from the alleged murderer Louis Roulet played by the ever wooden Ryan Phillippe. The only thing I find amazing from Phillippe's attempt at acting is his unique talent to deliver every line of dialogue without moving a single muscle on his face.The tension and intensity that begins to engulf Mike as the case continues is stellar. Lincoln Lawyer really pushes Mike to edge as his whole world becomes begins to collapse due to his AttorneyClient relationship. This is where Lincoln Lawyer really comes alive and delivers a must see movie experience. The court room scenes are some of my favorite scenes in the movie and there are plenty. The approach they took to portraying the lawyer aspect of the film feels accurate and realistic. The plot is solid and keeps you invested right from the beginning and keeps the grip tight throughout the movie. The movie keeps a good pacing and the dialogue is smart and witty. The film's color and camera work gives a very raw feel although at times it can be a little too unstable. The story and characterization is done well but there are a few things that should have been given more focus like Mike and Maggie's relationship and more insight as to why they got divorced. The movie touches on the idea with a scene or two but never really reveals too much. We also never really get too much on Mike's relationship with his daughter. My biggest problem with the film was the underwhelming ending that really had everything necessary to end the movie with but still felt lackluster when it came. However don't let these few problems sway you. I strongly recommend this film and promise you that you will leave satisfied.www.MovieFloss.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Agatha Christie would be proud of the fivetwist ending to THE LINCOLN LAWYER. The film is clearly topnotch and street smart. It's the most efficient solidly crafted courtroom thriller since PRIMAL FEAR and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. It has so many twists and turns that it's likely that Agatha Christie would be proud of it.It also reignites the career of Matthew McConaughey as an actor not just a charismatic star. He manages to be smoothly appealing despite playing a corrupt lawyer who has no scruples in defending guilty clients as long as they provide the cash flow he demands. It's only after defending RYAN PHILLIPPE from a charge of murder and rape that he realizes he does have a few scruples left. And the plot twists provided by the screenwriter John Romano from the novel by Michael Connelly are deftly handled for maximum shock effect. Brad Furman keeps the direction tight forceful and swiftmoving.The cast surrounding McConaughey has been selected with care and all of them offer realistic performances. Marisa Tomei is appealing as his exwife who knows his shortcomings but is still attracted to him and William H. Macy delivers a solid performance as his investigator friend. Ryan Phillippe is excellent as the client whose surface appearance belies the fact that he's as street smart as his sleazy lawyer and FRANCES FISHER is outstanding in a small but pivotal role as the young man's protective mother.Not since the days of PRIMAL FEAR and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION has there been a more intelligent script than this one designed to baffle and blindside the viewer in the course of unraveling some startling surprises.By all means highly recommended for fans of this genre.".

Brad Furman keeps the direction tight forceful and swiftmoving.The cast surrounding McConaughey has been selected with care and all of them offer realistic performances. Marisa Tomei is appealing as his exwife who knows his shortcomings but is still attracted to him and William H. Macy delivers a solid performance as his investigator friend. Ryan Phillippe is excellent as the client whose surface appearance belies the fact that he's as street smart as his sleazy lawyer and FRANCES FISHER is outstanding in a small but pivotal role as the young man's protective mother.Not since the days of PRIMAL FEAR and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION has there been a more intelligent script than this one designed to baffle and blindside the viewer in the course of unraveling some startling surprises.By all means highly recommended for fans of this genre.";

This film has pretty much the perfect mix of a smart plot with inventive twists amusing oneliners and captivating thoughtout characters.Limited action and instead using characters who have an actual story we get a film that sets itself above its competitors. A charming but also smart and strong Matthew McConaughey introduces us to a lawyer who has a few inner turmoils that develop along with the plot. There may be a few too many twists in the story and with the camera but the evolution of McConaughey's Haller is rather subtle and not clich.Questions of innocence versus guilt surround Louis Ryan Phillippe as Haller agrees to take on his case. But as the case starts to collide with incidents of the past present and future similar questions of guilt and innocence start plaguing Haller his other clients and the other lawyers. The fact that all these other characters are played by great actors only increases the entertainment value of this film. I highly recommend taking a thoughtful ride with The Lincoln Lawyer.".

His backstory wasn't much more than suggested in the film  lost licence broken marriage smartness that's a combination of natural intelligence and life at the grittier edge of things.

Roy Cohn would have been proud.McConaughey is no idealist his services come at a price.

He was literally caught in the act as two neighbors broke in and held him for the cops for raping Marguerite Levieva. Due to the canons of the Bar Association ethics McConaughey finds himself in a jackpot similar to the one Al Pacino found himself when he played a young idealistic lawyer in And Justice For All. But the results are a whole lot different because McConaughey is not an idealist and he makes those canons work for him.The film looks like the pilot of a TV series but I doubt we'll get any of the big name stars there if such a thing comes to pass. Marisa Tomei costars as McConaughey's exwife and a prosecutor to boot. Can't imagine what broke that marriage up. William H. Macy has a key role in this film as well as a private investigator who works for McConaughey and does very well in it.The Lincoln Lawyer is a very well done addition to the legal cinema with a cast that fills its roles out to a T.

He's almost like the James Bond of the justice system operating outside the rules but ultimately on the side of good. And himself.The one woman in his life is a common movie clich unfortunately though a useful onean exlover he's still a little in love with and they once had a child together so there is a tinge of sweetness once or twice. And this woman played by Marisa TomeiI never caught whether they were once married or if they were just making good on getting pregnant works in the D.A.'s office which is useful for a defense lawyer. The rest of the cast is straight Hollywood fare including a couple of older men big players who are always strong if a little too dependable and a couple of younger actors who are a bit more pretty than talented. The includes especially the principle perp Louis Roulet played Ryan Phillippe he was that brand new cop in Crash who is decent in a role that demanded amazing.Roulet is super rich and he's been accused of beating up a prostitute who in turn is accused of using Roulet in some kind of scam for his cash. It's complicated from the get go which makes the movie get your attention and hold onyou actually have to be careful not to get lost at first. The mind gamepower game between the two menMcConaughey and Phillippeis the crux of the movie but it never gets the intensity of say a Hitchcock film Hitch being the master of the innocent man accused and of psychological intensity. In fact you might say the movie misses a beat by letting the plot center mostly on the lawyer except for the simple fact that McConaughey is so darned good. The subplot with his child his relationship with Tomei and a few other small diversions don't add enough to make them worthwhile. There is luckily plenty of screen time with the two men together though all the courtroom scenes might not count Phillippe is oddly lifeless there except for one nice overacted speech about the horror of being accused of a crime you didn't commit. And gradually a very subtle shift in guilt and motive takes place so that what we thought was happening gets undermined.And it's no great surprise. The one surprise at the end isn't even a surprise quite or if it is it's not set up enough to really make you care. It's another clich worked into a well made movie with a single actor shining in something close to an Oscarwinning role. The title? And the selling point of the movie a lawyer working out of his Lincoln? A terrific idea that is only pertinent in small moments most notably and ludicrously in the motorcycle gang scenes plural Which shows another direction the movie might have taken into farce and comedy. But this is a congenial movie with a serious plot of crime enjoyable all the way through nothing more or less than that.".

I decided to give it a shot and given my low expectations I found the movie to be quite entertaining  despite its numerous flaws. If you are a fan of the endless stream of John Grisham bookturnedmovie then I expect you will find this one to your taste.Based on the Michael Connelly series of novels built around Mick Haller this one has the look and feel of part one. Haller is the Lincoln Lawyer so named because of his propensity to handle much of his work from the backseat of a classic Lincoln Town Car. The choice of McConaughey as Haller seemed all together wrong given his annual appearance in some lame ass RomCom where he spends most of each movie shirtless and smirking. Luckily for us Mr. McConaughey manages to recapture some of the acting skills he flashed in A Time to Kill so many years ago.In addition to his close to the vest portrayal of Haller the movie works because of an incredibly deep cast that includes Marisa Tomei as his exwife and frequent courtroom adversary she is an ADA Ryan Phillipe as the accused rich boy William H Macy as the longtime and streetwise private investigator Josh Lucas as the ADA in the main case Bryan Cranston as the detective in charge plus Michael Pena Bob Gunton warden from Shawshank John Leguizamo Frances Fisher Laurence Mason Earl the driver Shea Willingham Boardwalk Empire Trace Adkins country star as the leader of a biker gang and Michael Pare Eddie and Cruisers. Seriously this cast allows every scene to have something worth watching.The two things that prevent the movie from being top notch are the beyond belief exaggerated moments including about 3 too many endings and the absolutely distracting camera work courtesy of director Brad Furman. In the hands of a more experienced director many of the flaws could have been corrected.This is not presented as an ultra serious courtroom drama in the vein of 12 Angry Men or Judgment at Nuremberg. Rather it is a character driven story with a multitude of twists ... some of which work and some of which don't. I found it to be quite enjoyable despite the script issues and the heylookatme direction.".

And when Mick goes to see the man he had represented that was convicted of the other prostitute's murder and shows him a picture of Roulet who was the actual killer the guy just freaks out!

And when Mick goes to see the man he had represented that was convicted of the other prostitute's murder and shows him a picture of Roulet who was the actual killer the guy just freaks out! What was that? If he recognized the guy that could be his ticket out of jail but instead he just declares the interview over. There were other plot holes and stupid scenes this was more like a made for TV movie.";

	schema:headline " Crackling with tension and suspense and buoyed by an excellent performance by Matthew McConaughey this twisty and wellplotted legal thriller is one of the best in years";
	schema:reviewBody "Matthew McConaughey returns to the courtroom after a string of romcoms that had all but typecast him as the romantic cad to play the sleek smarmy and hustling defense attorney Mick Haller a famed Michael Connelly character whose first appearance was in the book on which this film is based. It was back in 1996 when McConaughey first made his mark in Hollywood with a stunning lead debut in the legal thriller A Time to Kill and it seems the years have not dimmed his ability to light up a courtroom. With his signature slick charm toothy grin and Southern drawl McConaughey is dynamic as ever in The Lincoln Lawyer the title a reference to his character's workplace the back seat of a Lincoln Continental whose registration plate reads NTGUILTY. Haller is chauffeured from courtroom to courtroom across Los Angeles by Earl Lawrence Mason a former client now offering his services in lieu of legal fees. His clientele belong in the rockbottom of society biker gangs drug dealers and prostitutes and because of this Haller's expertise lies in negotiating plea bargains through finding loopholes that can get crucial evidence thrown out of court. Cajoling wheedling and sweettalking are the tools of his trade very early on we see Haller sweettalking a bailiff to get a case advanced on the docket deliberately delaying the trial of a biker until he gets his fee and plea bargaining on behalf of a hooker who accepted payment in crack cocaine and McConaughey's cocksure ease fits just right with his character. His latest client however is somewhat different a Beverly Hills rich kid called Louis Roulet Ryan Phillippe who is being charged with assault and battery of a female escort. Haller knows that he has struck gold but the case starts becoming more complicated when Louis insists that he is innocent and flatly refuses to accept any plea bargain. The trailer will reveal more but as with any crime thriller the less you know the better. Suffice to say that veteran crime screenwriter John Romano has retained all the elements of Connelly's twisty cleverly plotted thriller including Roulet's overprotective matriarchal parent Mary Windsor Frances Fisher Haller's reliable investigator Frank Levin William H. Macy and Haller's exwifecumprosecutor Maggie McPherson Marisa Tomei. Other characters that readers of Connelly's book will instantly recognise are the bail bondsman Val John Leguizamo through whom Haller gets Roulet's case and Haller's former client Jesus Martinez Michael Pena intimately connected with his latest case. Romano had the unenviable task of condensing Connelly's pageturning novel into a twohour movie and he does so superbly without losing any of the tension or suspense in the story. He also loses none of Connelly's debates about the vagaries in the justice system seeing as how attorneys like Haller manage to put the innocent in jail and the guilty back out on the streets. Haller's crisis of conscience is also at the heart of the movie and McConaughey gets to do some serious acting when his character is eventually confronted with the magnitude of his past follies. On his part director Brad Furman The Take keeps the pace of the movie crackling every step of the way making this as much of a gripping yarn as reading Connelly's novel. Furman's most significant accomplishment is in employing Lukas Ettlin's cinematography to give the movie a great sense of place amidst the less glamorous streets of Los Angeles an unpretty look that suits the theme of the story just fine. Of course Furman and Ettlin are equally adept when it comes to courtroom drama and the backandforth questioning by Haller and the inexperienced prosecutor Josh Lucas unfolds with sizzling rhythm. Kudos to Furman too for assembling a topnotch ensemble cast who do outstandingly in their various supporting roles especially William H. Macy as the wisecracking investigator and Shea Whigham as a colourful jailhouse snitch called on the prosecution to testify against Roulet. But the actor that holds the movie from start to finish is McConaughey and just as how The Lincoln Lawyer became a starmaking turn for Connelly regular Mick Haller McConaughey's performance here will also be a similarly definitive turn as the on screen rendition of that character.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Lincoln Lawyer";
	schema:reviewBody "Matthew McConaughey's roles have usually been the action adventurer or the romantic comedy lead these days but it has always been his breakout role in Joel Schumacher's A Time to Kill based upon what would be my favourite amongst the John Grisham books that still remained one of his best until his second outing now in a role as a criminal defense lawyer in Michael Connelly's bestseller of the same name. I suppose McConaguhey can convincingly project the savvy and wily minds of what it takes to be a legal eagle given that after all he had swapped law school for film school.As Mick Haller McConaughey shows how slick his character can be in glib talking his way through his myriad of contacts and networks built up over the course of his career from ex clients to current ones from beat cops to opposing lawyers. At times you may suddenly think of it as being a bastardization of justice since Law Abiding Citizen reminded one and all that it's all boiled down to what you can actually prove in the court of law. So we actually cheer Haller on as the unorthodox lawyer who gets the job done guided by a moral compass not to put an innocent man behind bars. He operates out of the Lincoln sedan which is where the title got its name from though a scene in the trailer that affirmed his choice of office got left out.And as far as the trailer goes it probably hinted at all the narrative sequence to come  with Ryan Phillippe's Louis Roulet a rich playboy realtor who got accused of bashing up a prostitute and for Haller to defend him only to find that his client is more than meets the eye and may not be the innocent man he incessantly proclaims to be and ultimately finding room to threaten Haller and his family. Well thankfully that only scratched the surface of the story which with its rich characterization is one of the key reasons why this film should be watched since it's not your typical Matlock episode.I may say I've seen a number of courtroom movies and it does take something extra to provide that boost to its story and here's where Michael Connelly aces it by constantly highlighting a sense of danger in Haller's way that strikes very close to friends and family never fearful of getting things out of the equation. More interestingly he presents a moral and professional dilemma for Haller who finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place and has to utilize the full extent of his savvies to bail himself out of the situation have justice served lock the bad guys up and ultimately making sure his family remains safe from the very real threats coming his way.While lacking very big name stars this film is full of character actors that make The Lincoln Lawyer a compelling watch. There's Marisa Tomei as Haller's exwife and coprosecutor William H. Macy as the investigator for Haller's camp spotting some great hippie hairdo unseen in his films before John Leguizamo Michael Pena and Josh Lucas who plays a relatively green prosecutor. But of course McConaughey and Ryan Phillippe always bearing a sense of having something to hide were great opposite each other on the surface standing on the same side of the law but beneath there's trouble brewing with a capital T as the clientattorney privilege boundaries get close to being violated on moral grounds.Michael Connelly is probably better known for his detective Harry Bosch series of books but looking at how this turned out I'm secreting hoping the other films in the Mick Haller series get made as well. A great legal thriller on manipulation with a good twist at the end perhaps the cinematography could have been improved somewhat if all shaky cam moments got converted and done the more conventional way of putting the camera on a tripod.".

In this film he finds a perfect fit for his likable personality and screen charisma in a fictitious character created by Michael Connelly Blood Work a prolific bestselling author of legal thrillers. Michael Mickey Haller McConaughey conducts business in Los Angeles County from the back seat of a Lincoln Town Car driven by Earl Laurence Mason a former client working off his legal fees. This is a great role for McConaughey where he doesn't need to be over the top and spewing out ridiculous oneliners as he carries the film through beginning to end.Within the film we see that Haller is a smooth operator who relies on his street smarts to make sure he always gets payment up front for the legal services rendered. He tries hard to avoid lengthy trials and prefers to cut slick plea bargain deals for the scum he represents. The Lincoln Lawyer does play out as if there was a potential series or franchise lined up but since the film was not a box office success we were only left with one film. This film is far more engaging and entertaining than one would have originally presented as it keeps us the audience engaged in the story and wanting more of each step of the way. The supporting cast play their roles great the dialogue is clever and the end result isn't as predictable as some of these other recent drama releases. The camera work does resemble that of a television series which as been point out but as one continues watching the film unfold it becomes less of a problem.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wish I had seen this film back in 2011 so that I could herald the dawn of McConaughey's prime like so many of the critics did. Because this is the film that did it for him and I'm thrilled to see it was a strong start for him.The Lincoln Lawyer is a magnificent moral film with enough mindgames suspense and deceit to more than make up for its unremarkable court room scenes. John Romano's screenplay is full of depth and unfolds so beautifully that I couldn't fault a single turn. Brad Furman's direction is very skilled  the last twenty minutes of the film are flawless and so full of tension I was on the edge of my seat. The whole film looks beautiful with gorgeous cinematography and production design all around.There's nothing to say about McConaughey other than this was a remarkable turn for him digging his A Time to Kill dramalegal chops out from under his piles of romcom money. The rest of the cast is also excellent  though the film wastes Bryan Cranston  featuring gorgeous performances from Ryan Phillipe Marisa Tomei William H. Macey and Michael Pena. Michael Pena confirms his status as one of the most underrated actors in the profession with just a two scene turn as a man who pleaded guilty to a crime just to avoid the death penalty despite professing his innocence. The way in which Furman juxtaposed Martinez's first scene where he's almost howling in fear whilst a cool Haller tries to stay detached with the second where a shaved and icy Martinez deflects a noticeably upset Haller's attempts to finally hear his story is truly masterful. Tomei and McConaghey have great chemistry  to the extent that their divorce stops being believable at times but the script puts just enough conflict there to stop it being an afterthought.I have to dedicate time just to talk about Ryan Philippe in particular. Whatever he is up to in the script he plays convincingly. A wrongly accused rich kid? A desperate son? Or perhaps a coldblooded serial killer hiding behind the mask of his polite plea for freedom. Phillipe plays them all with incredible conviction but there is such fluidity to his performance that it doesn't feel clunky or forced. He began to scare me simply by his appearance on the screen. An incredible Oscarworthy performance by Phillipe which makes me sad that this film never got the attentions of the Academy. I can guarantee that there were a few films that year that could have sat out in categories for this film. Alexander Payne could've sat out for Furman and Max von Sydow for Phillipe. The Ides of March could've missed out for the screenplay here. The Lincoln Lawyer is technically a legal drama but the courtroom is just a place for this suspenseful wellacted moral play to unfold. Its the left bookend for a long McConassance and that should be reason enough to see it.".

I can guarantee that there were a few films that year that could have sat out in categories for this film. Alexander Payne could've sat out for Furman and Max von Sydow for Phillipe. The Ides of March could've missed out for the screenplay here. The Lincoln Lawyer is technically a legal drama but the courtroom is just a place for this suspenseful wellacted moral play to unfold. Its the left bookend for a long McConassance and that should be reason enough to see it.";

But he comes to know that bigger nightmare is if your client is pure evil and won't let you go if you don't win his case. The pacing is tight. There are witty one liners frequently. Acting is top notch especially by the lead actor Matthew McConaughey. It's a courtroom drama which grabs your attention from the very first scene and never let you go. You root for the central character. There are twists and turns some surprising and some predictable but at the end movie gives you the satisfaction of winning the case the right way.".

There is no subsequent tension between the two protagonists. This might have been a fault in the acting of one of them or from a lack of tension between the two actors or from the screen writing. W. H. Macy's role and Frances Fisher's role seem like throwaways in spite of being pivotal to the plot and since they are both excellent actors I have to assume this results from ineffective screen writing andor editing. And the movie does seem choppy to me. Scenes turn up seemingly out of nowhere and not in a way that made me think aha more like huh?I'd heard good things about McConaughey's acting in the title role and I don't think I can quibble with that. I believe my quibble is with the fact that his character seems like one man in the beginning of the movie let's describe him as a lawyerly conman McConaughey very effective then becomes a visibly challenged man then appears back to his assured self again all's right with his world. Did he learn anything? That part must have ended up on the cutting room floor.In the novel for example a relatively minor character as presented in the movie makes a dramatic career change as a result of occurrences.

	schema:reviewBody "The film begins with several instances of McConaughey's character Mick engaging in dishonesty for his own benefit. So it should not be surprising that Mick violates countless ethical rules and probably some criminal laws on his way to the climax of the film. The film's point of view about the justice system is extremely cynical the detectives don't hesitate to invent evidence and cut corners to convict someone they believe is guilty and the plot matches this dishonesty with Mick on his way to seeing that the guilty are convicted. The point of criminal justice is that the jury should decide and not the investigators or attorneys.However if you approach the film by getting past the obvious fact that this could never happen I think you can enjoy it on its own terms. This is not a crime mystery the mystery does not last long and it is not really a courtroom drama because the courtroom scenes last perhaps 15 minutes maximum. But the film creates some very interesting dilemmas on its way to the ultimate just and very ironic resolution.The acting was uniformly excellent. It is so refreshing to see a Matthew McConaughey film that relies upon his acting rather than his physique. I also found it interesting that McConaughey's opponent in the court room was Josh Lucas another actor who in years past has been more relied on for his looks rather than his acting check out Sweet Home Alabama for wretched example. Here he did a fine job.But the excellent acting even extended to the bit players all were convincing. I also loved Trace Adkins' bit as a biker. I totally enjoyed the film. It's definitely not perfect and certainly not art but it was very interesting and entertaining.".

	schema:headline " menage a trois in Japanese";
	schema:reviewBody "Mizoguchi was employed by a studio that wished post war Japan to target the womens market with superior slightly racy melodramas. He directed what by todays standard seems an incredible number of movies in a few years alternating personal projects like Lady Oharu with more commercial studio fare like this movie.This is a top class example of the type of movie that resulted. The term 'womens movie' can seem a little derisive  but this was simply the market they aimed for. It is an adaption of a well known and respected book from the early '30's although it is set in contemporary times while the original was set in the Meiji period. In the excellent Masters of Cinema DVD Tony Rayne's introduction suggests that Mizoguchi wasn't particularly proud of the movie one reason being that he was forced by the studio to miscast Kinuyo Tanaka as the eponymous heroine rather than a more elegant disciplined actress Hara Setsuko comes to mind as someone who would have played this beautifully. There is certainly a problem with the movie in that she plays the character as a more forceful modern woman than was probably intended. But I think only those who read the book would find this a major problem.The story concerns a young man who rather inconveniently falls in love with the beloved older sister Miss Oyu of his intended bride. His bride insists on going ahead with the marriage but without consummating it so that he can be close to Miss Oyu who is a widow who must live at home with her inlaws to take care of her son but by tradition is not allowed to remarry. Over the years the threeway relationship takes some predictably tragic turns.The story is far more melodramatic than the movies of this period by Ozu or Naruse. It could have been pretty horrible in the hands of a less skillful director than Mizoguchi. But his astonishingly beautiful sets and his famous one cut scenes sets the movie apart. It really is gorgeous to look at.These stories were and are seen by some Japanese as problematic as they can be seen as romanticizing archaic sentiments. To my western eyes I found it utterly fascinating. The manner in which people struggle under arranged marriages to find love and happiness is utterly alien to westerners yet still compelling. I had somewhat low expectations about this movie as several sources dismiss it as very minor compared to Mizoguchi's prewar and later period masterpieces. It is certainly not a work of genius to match Sansho Dayo or Ugetsu but I found it riveting viewing and certainly not a minor movie by any standards.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mizoguchi was employed by a studio that wished post war Japan to target the womens market with superior slightly racy melodramas. He directed what by todays standard seems an incredible number of movies in a few years alternating personal projects like Lady Oharu with more commercial studio fare like this movie.This is a top class example of the type of movie that resulted. The term 'womens movie' can seem a little derisive  but this was simply the market they aimed for. It is an adaption of a well known and respected book from the early '30's although it is set in contemporary times while the original was set in the Meiji period. In the excellent Masters of Cinema DVD Tony Rayne's introduction suggests that Mizoguchi wasn't particularly proud of the movie one reason being that he was forced by the studio to miscast Kinuyo Tanaka as the eponymous heroine rather than a more elegant disciplined actress Hara Setsuko comes to mind as someone who would have played this beautifully. There is certainly a problem with the movie in that she plays the character as a more forceful modern woman than was probably intended. But I think only those who read the book would find this a major problem.The story concerns a young man who rather inconveniently falls in love with the beloved older sister Miss Oyu of his intended bride. His bride insists on going ahead with the marriage but without consummating it so that he can be close to Miss Oyu who is a widow who must live at home with her inlaws to take care of her son but by tradition is not allowed to remarry. Over the years the threeway relationship takes some predictably tragic turns.The story is far more melodramatic than the movies of this period by Ozu or Naruse.

	schema:headline " A minor Mizoguchi but exquisitely constructed";
	schema:reviewBody "It's funny how sometimes one has to see a minor film by a great director to really understand the essence of their art. 'The Lady Vanishes' for example is minor Hitchcock of his late British period but it reflects the joy that he had found in turning expectations inside out and directing the eyes of the audience through camera and character movement.A few weeks ago I bought a box set of the last eight films of Kenji Mizoguchi and I am finally getting round to watching them. Of all major film directors Mizoguchi is the one whose work I know least  I had only seen two of his films albeit two great masterpieces  'Ugetsu Monogatari' and 'The Life of OHaru'.From those two films I thought of the director as a great weaver of mystical tales and adherent of tracking shots both of which are fine as far as they go but perhaps limiting in films of lesser stature. However taking the films in this set chronologically I encountered first 'Oyusama'  a tragic melodrama about the forbidden love of a young middleaged artisan for a widow of higher social station in turn of the century Japan. In spite of being toted as a minor work it impressed immediately with two aspects first the painterly precision of the film's early rural exteriors that closely resembled structurally several major Japanese artists  with nested planes of activity and visual interest drawing the spectator's eye irrevocably towards the focus of dramatic interest. The second and more important quality was that of the precision and the exquisite expression of the mise en scne.The story revolves around the mistake made by the central male character Shinnosuke when being introduced to a potential wife. He sees from 'afar' the party of young women and falls for the elder widowed sister Oye instead of the bride on offer Shizu. This is brilliantly managed by Mizoguchi by following the party of women in several longshots largely from Shinnosuke's point of view where Oyu takes the lead and Shizu is totally occluded by the other women. It sounds contrived but in the context of Shinnosuke's ignorance and eagerness it fits the situation perfectly. As the film progresses the precision of the mise en scne becomes even finer. There is a scene late on in the film when Shizu is undergoing a personal crisis in her marriage and she runs out of the house onto the beach to free herself from her woes. Oye follows to comfort her but Mizoguchi places the camera to show this as a pursuit with Shizu as running away from Oye  and dramatically that is exactly what is happening even though Shizu is trying to conceal it.It is said that Mizoguchi was unhappy with the film partly because the studio insisted on a linear narrative even though the novel on which it is based and the original script were structured as three long flashbacks. But there is enough complexity and resonance in the film to make it a valuable part of the director's work. The wellknown film that this most resembles in my view is Renoir's 'Une Partie de Campagne' with which it shares a moving account of the way in which social conventions can devastate the lives of those who love unconventionally. It doesn't have the lyricism nor humour of Renoir's little masterpiece but it does illuminate the filmmaker's art as mentioned above and through its modest achievements show Mizoguchi to be the great director that his reputation announces.".

The protagonists exemplify traditional family roles and are confronted with these traditions like in this movie a widow with children.

The two films that come to mind obviously are Tales from the Crypt Demon Knight with Billy Zane rated a 6.610 here which tackled the whole end of the worldstandoff in dinerlone hero fighting alongside the little guys against a legion of bad guys thing 10 times better and The Prophecy with Christopher Walken also rated a 6.610 here which tackled the whole good angel versus bad angelshowdown on earth thing 10 times better. Both came out in 1995 and while they didn't have the special effects that this one had they had a cohesive story GREAT acting and believable characters.The internet is going to crucify this film so I'm just going to break it down simply The first hour or so is pretty good and if it had stopped at the 70 minute mark it could come close to the 6.x rating it's getting now. The last 30 minutes is a rushed hatchet job that will make you regret seeing this film. Also SHAME on the editors of the film trailer for spoiling the two best scenes of the film the old lady reveal and the ice cream man reveal. I hate when you do this. You stole all of the impact those scenes had and lowered my rating by a point.Don't pay to see this film rent The Prophecy and Tales from the Crypt Demon Knight instead.".

The two films that come to mind obviously are Tales from the Crypt Demon Knight with Billy Zane rated a 6.610 here which tackled the whole end of the worldstandoff in dinerlone hero fighting alongside the little guys against a legion of bad guys thing 10 times better and The Prophecy with Christopher Walken also rated a 6.610 here which tackled the whole good angel versus bad angelshowdown on earth thing 10 times better. Both came out in 1995 and while they didn't have the special effects that this one had they had a cohesive story GREAT acting and believable characters.The internet is going to crucify this film so I'm just going to break it down simply The first hour or so is pretty good and if it had stopped at the 70 minute mark it could come close to the 6.x rating it's getting now. The last 30 minutes is a rushed hatchet job that will make you regret seeing this film. Also SHAME on the editors of the film trailer for spoiling the two best scenes of the film the old lady reveal and the ice cream man reveal. I hate when you do this.

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the god no pun intended awful reviews by most users here I found Legion very entertaining and fun. Those who probably hated it is probably because they're religious or think they are Roger Ebert or some hotshot critic. True there are many many loose ends in the story and plot holes the size of the grand canyon but despite these obvious flaws Legion remains an entertaining movie. Why is it so hard to believe that the almighty is a vengeful being? After all according to the bible he's wiped out cities like Sodom sent plagues to the Pharaohs and killed humans many times before so why it is so hard to believe Legion's premise that he's out to wipe out the human race. I'm a catholic and found the premise believable if any of this apocalyptic jargon is to be true. Angel Michael disobeys God's orders of termination and decides to aid a barricaded group of humans at a lone desert diner. Supposedly the waitress of this diner carries in her womb the second coming. Him being born will be a sign that humans will live on. Apparently God is SO angry that he won't let his second coming live. Why??? Well as I said before he let Jesus die so why not save all pain and sorrow and kill his son before he is born?Legion could've expanded into a more solemn message and more background on his second coming would've been nice. These story opportunities would've made for a more satisfying movie but at its core Legion is a blood and guts movie simple as that. The premise of the movie lent itself for grander things but writerdirector Scott Stweart kept things a bit too simple. It's weird seeing good guys like angels trying to wipe out humans instead of demons or devils. Yet angels adopt a demonlike quality when they posses humans which will have you asking if the almighty and the devil are really that different.The ending could've been more solemn but I repeat Legion will please gore and action film fans alike. People looking for answers and devout religion heads will surely hate this film. I haven't had so much fun watching a movie this intense in a long time.".

GOD was portrayed as a human with a heart and a mind that contradict each other also he was depressed people might say this was a bad decision but i think it is correct since humans are the image of god according to believers he made us like him 6. YOU SAW WHAT YOU WERE EXPECTED TO SEE there are no plot holes!! because the director wanted you to see just this and nothing more if other people could understand this they might also understand the whole plot. 7. here is a hypothesis so you understand the baby's role. the baby was the second coming and since god was angry at humans he didn't want to give them a second chance to survive now since Jesus became god it would mean the baby becomes god in the end of his life thus bringing with him his happiness and love for humans... so humanity survives....i could go on but it'll take all night so in shortLegion is a movie that you have to see without expecting it to be the movie of the year and over analyze every damn second of it. go watch it ONLY for entertainment and to kill an hour or so I'm not a fan of any of the actors or the director but i watched this movie with a free mind and i enjoyed it".

Its ridiculous preposterous with plot holes the size of cannon balls. You could pick this film apart until there was nothing left of it but angel wings and dirt. So here is the thing. Legion was incredibly entertaining! The action was wicked and intense the characters were fun and intriguing it was gory and action packed so despite everything else I had fun. You basically have to let go of everything to go into this film. And some people can do that because a movie is not always art or full of message and morality a film can also just be absolutely nothing but entertain and for me Legion did exactly that. Upon retrospect of the film you'll start to realize the startling amount of errors and plot holes but I think a movie should be reviewed mostly on its first impression like when you're sitting in the theater. The unfortunate side to the film is that it misses the incredible potential of this epic good vs evil battle by making the story rather convoluted and underusing the characters of Michael and Gabriel.Paul Bettany is a great actor and very versatile. I think the film makers of Legion were lucky to have him. He is brooding and strong and commanding as the rogue angel Michael. Even being a leading character they underuse him and we really don't get to see enough of his action. Lucas Black is naive and simple Jeep Hanson. In a normal film he would likely become the hero but when you've got an Angel to contend with you take a backseat and unfortunately that is where his performance is pushed to. He does well but is overshadowed in a big from the other actors in the film. That includes Dennis Quaid as Black's father. I love Quaid and this is no exception. Its a small role but he takes it and makes it his own and really commands the screen. Adrianne Palicki is the lead female who is basically the cause of this angelic war. Palicki is very underused because I think she could have given a really strong performance if she had been given the chance but like Black she takes a back seat. The cast is also boosted by some amazing supporting performances by Charles S. Dutton and Kevin Durand who should have also been used more. Also worth mentioning is solid supporting roles from Kate Walsh Jon Tenney and Willa Holland.Some might also go into this movie figuring it to be an epic battle between good and evil Angels and Demons further proved by the name of film Legion being a horde of demons that possess someone in the bible. Instead this is about a battle from Heaven between Angels not even fallen Angels. The special effects are solid and even breath taking at times. The film also reeks of being Stephen Kingesquire which in my opinion is one of the highest compliments. King could have put this together much much better but it has the twisted religious overtones the isolation of a desert gas bar and even the vivid characters. So for all of you that love to be simply entertained and want a thriller action even part horror film then absolutely treat yourself to Legion and avoid trying to pick it apart. It's a solid action trick. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "The trailer had me thinking that this would be one heck of a slice and dice fest in the same vein as Feast or even The Mist with a group of rag tag survivors being huddled together in a diner  supermarket and the fight for survival against invading monsters of all shapes sizes and surprises. The latter film also had a biblethumper and religion forms the basis of the premise here when you see how it all becomes a modern day reimagining of the tale of Mary Joseph and the prophetic messiah baby.That's just my angle at making sense of the flimsy plot which didn't develop properly despite ample time in the first half that had characters talking rationalizing and reflecting on just what their predicament is and how senseless it all seemed at the expense of action sequences that undeniably got better as the film wore on. Amongst the action offered that I've not seen before involved the angel Gabriel last done androgynously by Tilda Swinton in Constantine which brings to mind just how angels would be clad for battle with armour close combat weapon with frills and those metallic wings used both defensively and offensively in quite elegant ways as shield and blade combined in one sweeping motion. Not to forget flight too.Unfortunaately there are a number of close references to other films most notably the Terminator movies and the Matrix combined for certain scenes that looked way too familiar. The beginning already had Terminator like arrival of the angel Michael Paul Bettany to our world earmarked for destruction by God because he was losing faith in the bullshit of mankind. He's not following his book of Revelations though as he sends his angelic force to earth mimicking how Terminator robots get sent back in time. Or the severe warping of the human face to indicate possession by a higher in this case spiritual force.Basically the world is God's matrix and the angels being his agents sent to stop and destroy the birth of the prophetic Neo who is but an unborn child in Charlie Adrianne Palicki an unwed mom who's waitressing at a diner out of nowhere aptly titled Paradise Falls run by the estranged father and son team of Bob Dennis Quaid and Jeep Hanson Lucas Black from Fast and Furious 3 who get thrown into the thick of the action together with the rest of their diner crew and customers which can be easily read as fodder for the apocalypse which came in the form of a spider granny ice cream man and the likes.For the film to work you have to buy into its reasoning that God has decided to end the world through an unfair battle using his angels against humans and the absence of the Devil whom a friend thought would actually either rejoice or would have gathered new followers with the exodus of human souls now being abandoned by the holy one. If you don't subscribe to this premise then everything will not hold water and it'll become just another mindless action flick that flits from one sequence to another. And let me know if you don't agree that the baby is the messiah if I wanted to go one step further it could even be the second coming since every angel bowed their heads in reverence and stopped dead in their tracks. It wasn't explained why the baby held the key to the salvation of mankind so that's my speculation. After all Michael the angel did find it worthwhile to switch sides in order to find some glimmer of hope amongst mankind to change his master's mind.Legion had an interesting potential but ultimately got let down by its halfbaked plot development and references so close you'd think it was The Matrix or The Terminator. It got played out too seriously for its good though with room given for a sequel if one ever gets made given the way it ended really like The Terminator again and this time maybe with room to deal with the demons now that angels are likely out of the way.".

An out oftheway diner becomes an unlikely battleground for the survival of humankind as Michael and a group of strangers defend themselves against God's legion of angels. Michael must protect a mother Palicki and her baby for it is the key to ending the Apocalypse. Let me start off by saying that Legion is not a good movie however it is not terrible by any means. Unlike recent biblical horrors The Unborn comes to mind Legion tries very hard not to follow the lame clichs of recent horrors I always commend a film for trying to be good. Unfortunately it takes itself a little to seriously with God's legion of zombies that are supposed to be possessed by angels. The film also was terribly written What's your beef? Simmer down! Hold on white boy with weird scenes that needed some serious editing. Besides the bad script and erratic editing the acting was terrible. The only exceptions were Paul Bettany who seemed to have flown into the wrong movie and Lucas Black Sling Blade Friday Night Lights. Everyone else was uninspired and made the bad screenplay look much more terrible than it was. The action scenes are where this film soared. The fight between the two Archangels was incredible and the visual effects were on par. Overall Legion is a biblical Assault on Precinct 13. It lacks a good script editing cinematography and acting. I commend it for trying to be less like recent horror films that really shouldn't even call themselves 'films. I think deep down on the cutting room floor there was something there but we don't see it. Legion is by no means horrible but I can't recommend it.Rating 510".

	schema:headline " Neat concept not very well done";
	schema:reviewBody "Legion is about the apocalypse and one fallen angel who tries to save the last hope for humanity. With such a high concept it's weird how it's actually taking place in a rather constrained space  a truck diner lost in an American desert. My first impression was that the special effects looked cheap witness the first human transformation and the way it talks while barely moving its mouth. It's an impression that stayed with me throughout until perhaps the final antagonist. My second impression was that the acting wasn't that bad. I didn't recognize the actor playing the main angel character Paul Bettany until the day after while reading the credits. He's not one we usually see as an action hero in this kind of flick but he gave a decent performance as the strong stoic type. I also remembered Lucas Black playing Jeep  what a lousy character's name from the time he was a talented child actor. He still is. We also have the ever reliable Dennis Quaid in a supernatural thriller yet again. My third impression was that the little old lady seen in previews reminded me of the crazy old gypsy woman from Drag me to Hell. It's no wonder she's shown in previews it's one of the best moments. However it spoils the surprise. My fourth impression was that following the granny the possessed people were rather slow stupid and not particularly menacing very much like zombies even though they were not. My fifth impression was that at least the filmmakers were trying to achieve character moments instead of tiring us out with incessant action. My sixth impression after the film was that considering the origin of the possessed humans and the objective desired it was really ridiculous and unbelievable to proceed that way especially considering the supposedly superior intelligence at work. My last impression is that although it's certainly watchable as a distraction it's not really effective or a particularly good film in the genre despite the angels seldom seen in features these days. Don't watch Legion expecting a bigbudget epic fantasy it's more like an intimate closed space last stand bmovie thriller without that many thrills.Rating 5 out of 10 for mediocreP.S. Don't watch it expecting a legion of angels either. You would be disappointed.".

	onyx:emotionText "Legion is about the apocalypse and one fallen angel who tries to save the last hope for humanity. With such a high concept it's weird how it's actually taking place in a rather constrained space  a truck diner lost in an American desert. My first impression was that the special effects looked cheap witness the first human transformation and the way it talks while barely moving its mouth. It's an impression that stayed with me throughout until perhaps the final antagonist. My second impression was that the acting wasn't that bad. I didn't recognize the actor playing the main angel character Paul Bettany until the day after while reading the credits. He's not one we usually see as an action hero in this kind of flick but he gave a decent performance as the strong stoic type. I also remembered Lucas Black playing Jeep  what a lousy character's name from the time he was a talented child actor. He still is. We also have the ever reliable Dennis Quaid in a supernatural thriller yet again. My third impression was that the little old lady seen in previews reminded me of the crazy old gypsy woman from Drag me to Hell. It's no wonder she's shown in previews it's one of the best moments.

Paul Bettany was very enjoyable as the fallen angel who goes against god. For me this was a film with a lot of missed opportunities... the ice cream man who turned into the human spider.. here was a moment that was drawn out and you were expecting a big attack and it ends so abruptly with NOTHING happening. When all the cars start driving towards the diner why they stop and get out is beyond me... why they don't just run all 300 cars into the diner killing everyone is something i wont understand... there is no real explanation for a lot like why Gabriel didn't just show up right away or why the director cast Lucas blackGod truly punished me by showing black try to act. Overall it was a fun movie but flawed. I did enjoy it but felt that i kept asking why is this happening A lot. And as the main characters drive away to end the film we see our Sarah Connor even wearing a bandanna and she says god is tired of the bullst and i have to agree i was tired of asking why and trying to figure out the bullst. in the end it needed to be simpler with more action... to much was left to the imagination. have faith... have faith they will corrected the wrongs with the straight to DVD sequel.".

I've seen lots of people complaining that the last quarter is a weak point and though I can see the argument it still does run everything back together nicely. There are some weird points not fully explained SPOILER the prophetic tattoos on Jeeps arm? and I do find the level of character deathrate slightly too high. Yet I finished the film feeling it had made its point humanity is basically scum but with redeeming features nothing too high brow or original but valid none the less. I didn't find the acting or lines overly cheesy or strained as others have said in fact I thought Paul Bettany did a damn fine job being the soldier built on compassion his character required. Perhaps he could have been slightly less mystical about his intentions but then again I wouldn't have thought many people would accept I'm an angel disobeying God by protecting this potential prophet. Overall what I really wish to stress with this review is that the current 510 rating is fine until held in comparison. IMDb currently rates films which ARE poorly scripted cheesily acted and generally confusing with plot lines such as XMen Origins Wolverine and The Lost Boys at much higher status 6710 and I don't feel that in comparison Legion deserves its current status. It is very similar to many big Hollywood films such as Wolverine it's an enjoyable well acted romp with some decent if not too subtle character development and a script which does the job.".

	schema:reviewBody "An allstar cast superb dialogue effective lighting and editing great production design and interesting costumes rev up the technical quality of this cinematic spoof of literary whodunits. An eccentric genius named Lionel Twain Truman Capote invites the world's five greatest fictional detectives to a dinner party at which time someone will be murdered. The detective who solves the crime first gets 1 million.Everything in this film from the acting to the sound effects to the plot ... is deliciously exaggerated ... hence the humor. For example mystery readers accept that Hercule Poirot and Charlie Chan are so observant as to spot the most obscure clue which conveniently points to the solution of the puzzle. In Murder By Death writer Neil Simon exaggerates that gambit. A guest detective draws the most outlandish conclusion from the most irrelevant fact which in turn is shot down by another guest detective who points out the flaws and then proceeds to do exactly the same thing.The dialogue is marvelous. In one scene the blind butler serves nonexistent soup from an empty bowl to which Miss Marbles Elsa Lanchester protests Murder by starvation maybe that's his game. In another scene Inspector Perrier James Coco reads from a list and then concludes Everything here has been rented for tonight. Miss Marbles responds in a melodramatic voice You mean? Yes answers Perrier momentously this entire murder has been  catered.And then there's the scene wherein Sam Diamond Peter Falk ruminates I don't get it first they steal the body and leave the clothes then they steal the clothes and bring the body back. Who would do a thing like that? To which Dick Charleston David Niven responds in a serious tone Possibly some deranged dry cleaner.The film's casting is wonderful. Truman Capote may not be much of an actor but he brings to the film a personality that is appropriately eccentric. My only problem is that the amount of screen time for the cast is uneven ... too much for Peter Falk and Peter Sellers and not enough for Elsa Lanchester who arrives late.Murder By Death is a wonderful film classic that still holds up thirty years after it was made. The film conveys no heavyduty political or social message no great insight into the human condition. But when you're in the mood for lighthearted escapist entertainment that provides some laughs this film is a great choice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Murder by Death is a comic murdermystery done in absolute lunacy. I mean this is one screwball comedy that made me laugh out loud quite often. And yet there are so many confusing moments that I didn't know what on earth was going on. It seems that writer Neil Simon was trying to complicate moviegoers with his screenplay to this movie which pays homage to detectives of old classic movies such as Charlie Chan Miss Marple Sam Spade and Hercule Poirot. In Murder by Death a mysterious man invites the 5 greatest detectives to his home for dinner and a murder as he describes it. An allstar cast is featured here and all of them are very funny. The best Peter Sellers in the Charlie Chan takeoff. Sellers is of course best known for playing the inept Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies but his role here as Chinese detective Sidney Wang is a hoot. He made me laugh the hardest. Just looking at him made me laugh. The way he talked made me laugh. He's naturally funny everytime he's on screen. Also funny the great Sir Alec Guinness as a blind butler. I thought he was supposed to be a serious actor! I don't think I've ever seen Guinness in a movie comedy but he makes the most of his character here. He comes second behind Sellers in the laugh department in Murder by Death. Two other funny performances are turned in by James Coco and James Cromwell Babe and L.A. Confidential as the Hercule Poirot sendoff and his chauffeur. It's funny to watch a younger Cromwell here speaking with a bad European accent. David Niven Maggie Smith Peter Falk Eileen Brennan Elsa Lanchester and Nancy Walker also register laughs too. But the most downright goofiest character in Murder by Death is the host orchestrating this crazy game played by Truman Capote. He's very funny too. Another major factor in the film are the sets of the old mansion the movie takes place in. They're marvelous. But at times the story gets real complicated and seems to get parts dislocated. It bothered me a little the first time I saw this. Now I just sit back and let the movie play on. Neil Simon intended on this to be a crazy comedy and in that way he succeeded. Murder by Death is allinall a very enjoyable movie. out of four".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an utterly hilarious parody spoofing detective stories. Much of the humor is verbal some of it relies on stereotypes and such related mainly to the crime story genre. Some of the humor is a tad dirty and a bit of it is quite dark. Personally I loved it but if you have anything against such humor you may want to skip this one. It doesn't try too hard to make you laugh. The laughs roll in quite naturally as it parodies a few of the most wellknown fictional detectives Agatha Christie's Mrs. Marble among others. The setting is one typical to detective stories and the atmosphere is simply perfect. The plot is very good and develops nicely while still remaining interesting. The pacing is mostly flawless but it seemed to lose momentum some around the last third. The acting is all good especially from Alec Guinness Peter Falk and Peter Sellers. One wouldn't expect particularly good performances in a comedy but this manages. The film is well thought out and equally wellexecuted. The only thing I didn't like was that the ending or maybe the entire third half of the film seemed a bit anticlimactic. At this point all the action is done and we're just waiting to find out who's behind it all. The very end is quite good though a very funny and entertaining twist to say the least. And everything leading up to it is incredibly funny. The characters while admittedly based somewhat on stereotypes are all entertaining and each have their own shtick among them are Milo Perrier the perpetually hungry and ridiculously sensitive Frenchman and the very British Dick Charleston played to perfection by David Niven and last but most definitely not least Sam DiamondPeter Falk doing his Columbo thing borrowing from noir and Bogart complete with nonsensical lengthy rants. I recommend this to anyone into detective movies andor spoofs. Do keep the humor I mentioned early in the review in mind when considering whether or not to watch. 810".

The pacing is mostly flawless but it seemed to lose momentum some around the last third. The acting is all good especially from Alec Guinness Peter Falk and Peter Sellers. One wouldn't expect particularly good performances in a comedy but this manages. The film is well thought out and equally wellexecuted. The only thing I didn't like was that the ending or maybe the entire third half of the film seemed a bit anticlimactic. At this point all the action is done and we're just waiting to find out who's behind it all. The very end is quite good though a very funny and entertaining twist to say the least. And everything leading up to it is incredibly funny. The characters while admittedly based somewhat on stereotypes are all entertaining and each have their own shtick among them are Milo Perrier the perpetually hungry and ridiculously sensitive Frenchman and the very British Dick Charleston played to perfection by David Niven and last but most definitely not least Sam DiamondPeter Falk doing his Columbo thing borrowing from noir and Bogart complete with nonsensical lengthy rants. I recommend this to anyone into detective movies andor spoofs. Do keep the humor I mentioned early in the review in mind when considering whether or not to watch. 810";

	schema:headline " When murder can really be funny";
	schema:reviewBody "Murder by Death is the best and funniest parody of mystery movies ever made. Neil Simon's premise is simple yet ingenious. The world's greatest detectives  from movies of course  come together to compete to solve a murder that has yet to occur. The plot has many twists. The cast is exceptional. Major stars of the past and present imitate major stars of the past and present in 1976. It plays on words in the names of the characters. It has witty dialog and very funny lines throughout. I'll have more on the cast below. The direction is superb. And the set for this film is marvelous. Columbia built the castle on a huge stage. Simon threw into the mix of the five super sleuths and their companions three other characters. Truman Capote plays Lionel Twain the host for the farce and he does it quite well. Nancy Walker plays the temporary kitchen maid hired to cook the dinner. She is a deafmute. Alec Guinness is a blind butler who has worked for Twain for a time. Watch for all the fun over his name Jamesir Bensonmum. Simon devised a plot with the butler at the center. And Guinness provides more laughter than anyone else in this laugh fest. The opening has Twain writing the invitations to his murdermystery dinner. No date is given but it's to be Saturday at 7 p.m. The invitations are addressed to the super sleuths in New York Catalina Brussels San Francisco and Sussex England. So in less than a week the five sleuths all receive their mail book their travel reservations and make it to 22 Lola Lane wherever that is. The invitations don't give the city and state. And then the blind butler licks Eisenhower 8cent stamps to put on all the invites including those to Belgium and England. But wait! He misses the envelopes and pounds the stamps on the desktop. Twain says nothing to him as he walks off to post the invites. It just gets better and better from there on. Outside the house number is 22 Twain. This is a loaded play on words. First Samuel Clemens' pen name was Mark Twain for two. Second it's a parody of Lionel toy trains  the host's name is Lionel Twain. Third when Charlie Wang and his adopted Japanese son pull up in their car Charlie asks What number of house? His son says two two. Charlie says Correct. Twotwo Twain's house. I laughed so hard as Peter Sellers said the line that resembled a little child saying choochoo train. A very funny scene is the arrival of the deafmute maid. The Butler can't see her and she can't hear him or speak. She holds up a note for Guinness to read while he says Speak up woman. Oh a little shy. Well  and he hands her a menu and tells her to get cooking. Her note gives her name Yetta and says she can't read English. So she sits down at the kitchen table and just waits  to the end of the movie. This will be the source of much more humor when it comes time for Guinness to serve the dinner. Another great scene has Guinness escorting Dick and Dora to their room. Bensonmum Ah here we are. The late Mrs. Twain's room. She died in here. Dora Oh dear. Dick Died of what? Bensonmum She murdered herself in her sleep sir. Dick You mean suicide? Bensonmum Oh no. It was murder all right. Mrs. Twain hated herself. We keep this room locked. Dick Why is that? Bensonmum Mr. Twain loved her very much. He's kept her room just as it was the night she choked herself nine years ago.Many people today may not know some of the parodied characters. So here's a brief rundown. Peter Sellers plays Sidney Wang and Richard Narita plays Willie Wang. Wang is a parody of Charlie Chan a Chinese American detective created by American novelist Earl Derr Biggers. And Sidney Toler was one of 13 actors who played Charlie Chan. He had the most roles  22 of the 58 films. Charlie Chan held the record for films based on his character until the late 20th century when Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot overtook him. Peter Falk plays Sam Diamond a parody of Sam Spade. He might have been named Sam Heart or Sam Club. Dashiell Hammett created him in The Maltese Falcon. Falk parodies the character that Humphrey Bogart played in the movie. Eileen Brennan plays Sam's sidekick Tess Skeffington. David Niven and Maggie Smith play the roles that parody the Thin Man series of films in the 1930s and 1940s. William Powell and Myrna Loy starred as Nick and Nora Charles. Here the sleuths are Dick and Dora Charleston. James Coco plays Milo Perrier the parody of Hercule Poirot and his sidekick is James Cromwell as Marcel. The last sleuth is Jessica Marbles a double parody in hindsight. Jane Marple was another Agatha Christie creation and Jessica is the name of a later sleuth Jessica Fletcher. She was the TV character from the 1980s series Murder She Wrote. that starred Angela Lansbury. How could Simon know her name so far in advance? Elsa Lanchester plays Jessica Marbles and Estelle Winwood plays her nurse Withers. That's a spoof of yet another famous female detective of the early 1930s Hildegarde Withers. She was created by novelist Stuart Palmer.This is a wonderful comedy but it's not for the whole family. Kids  even most teens won't get the witty lines. Most won't recognize or be able to appreciate the parodies. And some of the language toward the end is unsuitable including profanity disrespect and crudity. Most adults can tolerate the small amount of offcolor language for the overall humor of the movie.".

Unlike my numerous viewings of 'Clue' watching 'Murder By Death' seemed a new yet reminiscent experience.'Murder by Death' is written by Neil Simon and directed by Robert Moore. It stars Alec Guinness Peter Sellers Maggie Smith James Coco Peter Falk and David Niven. It's about five of the world greatest detectives that are invited to a mansion for dinner and a murder. It's basically a spoof of the on the mystery genre and the great detectives of literature and film. I am not familiar with Neil Simon's written work but the script did have some funny but also repetitive moments. Robert Moore's direction was adequate and the performances were good most notably from Peter Falk and Peter Sellers.Made in 1976 it's hard to imagine comedies being produced like this today. The main problem with 'Murder By Death' is that it seems to forget it's visual medium and most of the gags come from the script. It's safe to assume that anyone could have directed this film as it was the scriptwriter Neil Simon who was credited alongside the title. I felt that the mansion wasn't explored enough and therefore the mystery element was lacking. But then again it was a comedyspoof! I particularly liked the blind butler Alec Guinness and deaf cook Nancy Walker interaction! Peter Seller's Wang was very funny too but I'm afraid some of today's politically correct audience will have a hard time separating racism from the obvious stereotypes in the portrayal of Wang and the other characters in the film. One must understand that the humour isn't based on race rather Sellers was portraying a modern at the time 70s comic take on depictions of stereotypes within the character displayed in earlier detective Charlie Chan. It was an obvious spoof on stereotypes already established in the famous detectives of the early era of film and literature.There is also a really interesting performance by a young James Cromwell in this film which was pretty funny. 'Murder by Death' is an interesting film if only for it's cast in an unusual spoof on the unique mystery genre. It's fairly enjoyable to watch but it isn't a laughaminute experience.  out of !".

	schema:reviewBody "For a time during the 1970s writer Neil Simon was so hot that his name alone was enough to ensure box office successand one of the results of that fame was MURDER BY DEATH a parody of murder mysteries of earlier decades.The concept is quite clever bringing together celebrated detectives of fiction and film Dick and Dora Charleston based on Nick and Nora Charles of the celebrated THIN MAN films Milo Perrier and Jessica Marbles Hercules Poriot and Jane Marple of Agatha Christie's celebrated novels Sidney Wang and son Willie Charlie Chan and son of the fondly remembered film series and Sam Diamond Sam Spade of THE MALTESE FALCON. Each has been invited for an overnight party at the home of the eccentric Lionel Twainbut upon arrival their hosts seals the mansion and informs them that a vicious murder will occur at midnight. Can the world's greatest detectives solve their way out of this one? The casting is inspired particularly so re Lionel Twain who is played by Truman Capote an individual every bit as eccentric as the character he plays. David Niven and Maggie Smith do the honors as Dick and Dora James Coco and the evermemorable Elsa Lanchester appear as Perrier and Miss Marbles Peter Sellers dons Asian attire for Inspector Wang and Peter Faulk runs wild as toughtalking Sam Diamond. Alec Guiness Nancy Walker Eileen Brennar and Estelle Winwood also offer memorable support. The dialogue is quite clever referencing the various source material of the characters and is quite often laughoutloud funny in its absurdity.What is not particularly interesting is the plot. After a certain point the film becomes distinctly onenote and to describe the conclusion as unfortunate would be an understatement indeed it would be difficult to say that the film has any conclusion at all. Even so the performers make it a fun affair and it will particularly appeal to murder mystery fans who recall the original characters fondly. The DVD offers a choice of panandscan or widescreen trivial notes and more interestingly a brief interview with Simon himself. Don't expect too much of it and you'll enjoy it quite a bit.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:reviewBody "Simon is good at barbed exchanges as in most of The Odd Couple. But he has a tendency to get serious sometimes and it rarely works even when the serious ones have some occasional good oneliners in them. His drama tends to be dull and his comedies funny especially in domestic contexts and when they're dialog dependent.This is different from his other familiar works. He really lets go here forgets all about serious undertones meaningfulness depth of relationships domesticity continuity  everything except the comic effect. He's the Edgar Allan Poe of comedy here. He hasn't written such a funny script since After the Fox.The plot itself after the broth is reduced is simple enough. Truman Capote invites five of the world's most famous detectives to a weekend at his spooky country mansion tells them a murder will be committed at midnight and challenges them to solve it or lose their reputations.What follows is hilarious. Not just sharply funny exchanges but entire situations that are in themselves outrageous so that the verbal elements are like icing on the cake. It's the kind of movie in which a line like My chauffeur was injured by a falling gargoyle while standing outside in Chinese footprints makes an idiotic kind of sense. A movie in which a character can offer this as an explanation for his having been found in a gay bar I hate them queeries. Lots of dames go in those places anyway. I never kissed nobody. And I never done anything to a man that I wouldn't do with a woman. A movie in which two old ladies are about to fall asleep in bed when one of them sniffs and says I smell gas. The second says I can't help it. I'm old. The first says No no. Not THAT kind of gas. The other kind. The kind that KILLS. And the second begins a reply with Sometimes MY gas . . . . I could go on with these gags but why spoil it? And anyway there are sight gags and situational discombobulations that are just as funny but would take far too long to describe.Not all of the gags and situations are equally funny. How could they be? Nancy Walker plays a mute maid who's purpose in the movie eludes me. And some of the gags are silly rather than funny. But the weaknesses are minor and more than made up for by the movie's many virtues. Especially good is Peter Falk's Sam Diamond who does an insane impression of Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade. The actor played the same character in the later lesssuccessful The Cheap Detective. Simon even allows himself to play with the frame at the end. Falk and Eileen Brennan my secretary and mistress are driving away from the mansion and Brennan says I guess this means we won't be seeing each other anymore Sam. Falk Well Angel you can never tell. I'll be around. And if you need me all you gotta do is whistle. You know how to whistle don't you? Brennan Well of course I know how to whistle Sam. What a silly question. Everybody knows how to whistle  Falk looks disgusted turns away from her to stare into the camera and says Allright alright. Forget it. You ruined it.I won't go on any longer about this sometimes extremely amusing film. Anything I would say would ruin it although I must add that this is one of those movies you can watch and enjoy repeatedly and without necessarily being in exactly the right mood for it  unlike say Marx Brothers movies or W. C. Fields. It's one of the most laughridden products of its decade. Watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Murder by Death recently in a backtoback with The Cheap Detective both Neil Simon scripts that were written directly for film and both spoofs of particular film genres. Murder by Death is the superior of the two although considering my low opinion of Neil Simon superior here means watchable on a rainy day.      This is a sendup of the distinctly styled Agatha Christie whodunits the sort on which the game of Clue was based Colonel Mustard did it in the kitchen with a revolver.  The five greatest detectives in the world Sam Spade Charlie Chan Nick and Nora Charles Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot are invited to the home of Lionel Twain get it? to solve a murder that has not been committed but will be before midnight.  Twain is out to prove that he and not they is the greatest detective in the world and tries to stump them all.  The price to the winner one million dollars.  But when Twain himself turns up as the victim the game is really on.      Peter Falk gets to do his Bogart imitation again although this movie precedes Cheap Detective and comes off a lot better. Simon writes Sam Spade with a twist he is a crude lout openly rude and insulting to the other guests.  Twain I'm the greatest detective in the world. I'm number one!  Spade  You look a little like number two to me if you know what I mean.  It's a subtle shade in characterization that goes a long way in getting laughs.  Peter Sellers is terrific as the Charlie Chan character spouting off absurd proverbs and profundities David Niven and Maggie Smith are acceptably droll as Nick and Nora and Alec Guinness does a nice turn as a blind butler. Falk and Sellers absolutely steal the movie as does Truman Capote in his one and only film as the redoubtable Twain he has one great scene that nearly brings the film to a halt.  The weak link in the cast is Jimmy Coco as Poirot who is just plain hamacting instead of bringing out a natural humor from within the character.  His pathetic comic French makes Inspector Clouseau sound like DeGaulle.          The screenplay has the requisite twists and turns and then some until the murderer is finally revealed or is he?  It's an amusing ride although some great performances beat Neil Simon's jokes by a country mile. And by the way why wasn't Clouseau invited?  It's not like Peter Sellers hasn't played multiple roles in a film before.  3  out of 4".

Murder by Death is the superior of the two although considering my low opinion of Neil Simon superior here means watchable on a rainy day.      This is a sendup of the distinctly styled Agatha Christie whodunits the sort on which the game of Clue was based Colonel Mustard did it in the kitchen with a revolver.  The five greatest detectives in the world Sam Spade Charlie Chan Nick and Nora Charles Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot are invited to the home of Lionel Twain get it? to solve a murder that has not been committed but will be before midnight.  Twain is out to prove that he and not they is the greatest detective in the world and tries to stump them all.  The price to the winner one million dollars.  But when Twain himself turns up as the victim the game is really on.      Peter Falk gets to do his Bogart imitation again although this movie precedes Cheap Detective and comes off a lot better. Simon writes Sam Spade with a twist he is a crude lout openly rude and insulting to the other guests.  Twain I'm the greatest detective in the world. I'm number one!

If you're gonna call anything a ripoff it'd be Spider's Web A Pig's Tale It was so unspeakably awful I couldn't last 3 minutes after it. It's a hobo's version of Gordy or one of South Park's top 10 worst episodes where they ripped off the whole plot by making 4 retarded idiots with annoying voices saving baby cows from a slaugther house That too is a hobo's Gordy.".

I admit it may be corny to those older than 10 but it definitely a good choice for a young one. The actors are a little cheesy but the talking animals are too cute. The plot is interesting as the main character Gordy is trying to save his family so of course the story is good for little ones to learn family values.".

I would rather saw off my head with an electric toothbrush modified of course than to watch this movie again.There are so many parts of this movie that are just completely unbelievable it makes you want to cry Ignore the fact that the pig talks and humans can understand him....that's the most believable thing in the movie.During one scene the kid and pig are walking down the road lost when all of the sudden the only people in the entire country that know them pass by them in their RV. Granted this is just some country road and the people in the RV are traveling all over the country singing.Another scene has the bad guys throwing a pig off a couple hundred feet bridge where Cousin Idiot is able to catch the pig in his arms down below without the other people noticing.The wealthy businessman dies and leaves his company to his young grandson. However because his grandson is too young to run the company he gives complete control to Gordy. Gordy is a f'ing pig mind you. The pig is then shown interviewed numerous times on stock market  business type shows where the host asks him a question and the pig snorts a few times in response.The entire plot seems like it was generated by some drawing board created by a 3 year old. I cannot imagine how this actually got funding to produce or how badly an actor needed a job to look at this script and say Hell yes sign me up.".

	schema:reviewBody "The talking pig who made it big has got people here folks! He's just your average adorable little piglet from a typical farm family. That is until his family has been taken away! Now he's off on an epic search in the city to find them! Along the way he makes friends with two kids and saves one of them from drowning! Gordy becomes famous for his actions of heroism and becomes the CEO of a business! Eventually with all the fame Gordy has attracted he gets his own stamp! Meanwhile an unscrupulous business man tries to take on Gordy and get rid of him! His henchman are told to kidnap him tie him in a sack and toss him in the river! But with the help of his new friends they all figure out where his family's been taken to a slaughterhouse in Omaha. They go there and successfully shut the sinister slaughterhouse down once and for all! And in the end Gordy and his friends and family all get to live together on the farm forever! This seems to be a loveit or hateit type movie. But I loved it! A sweet story cute characters and a precious piglet! This is the most underrated movie ever! It's beautiful and proves that no matter how small you may be you can always make a difference! And it's NOT a ripoff of Babe. They are just as good and just happen to share some similarities.UPDATE ON September 17 Actually Spider's Web A Pig's Tale is not a hobo's version of Gordy. It is an in name only mockbuster of Charlotte's Web which just so happened to be released three weeks and three days before the liveaction version came out. So what did they do? That's right they copied the original animated masterpiece from 1973. Very loosely that is. Hence it's an in name only mockbuster. Also I never knew South Park ripped off Gordy. And I already hate that show just like you do for pretty much the same reasons. Look at my list entitled The most overrated shows and movies ever and you'll see my reasons why. And as far as I'm concerned the real reason Gordy's a great gem of a movie is not because it's funny although that contributes. No the real reason it's wonderful is because of its heartwarming story which is NOT charmless it's adorable its lovable characters come on you know Gordy's adorable its wonderful moral messages I've already touched on this in this review and the one on my other account and it's just plain entertaining wholesome family fun. I know a lot of people say it's too dark with the slaughterhouse but what about Bambi? Or The Lion King? They both feature the death of the most important parent in Bambi it's the mother in Lion King it's Simba's father Mufasa. At least Gordy's parents don't die. This is actually one of the few Disney movies where the parents live. Which makes it a lot like Sleeping Beauty Peter Pan Tangled and Mulan. Also Sleeping Beauty was dark too. And then there's people think this is ripoff of Babe um no it's not. Babe's not about a pig having to save his family Gordy's not about a pig aspiring to become a sheepdog. They're different plots people! Plus Sleeping Beauty was A LOT like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs does that make it a ripoff too? And I already mentioned one reason why Lion King and Bambi are alike but there's more. They both have the Circle of Life theme they both have the protagonist as next inline for the throne they both have the antagonist kill the important parent there's a fire in both movies the hyenas assist Scar the same way Man is assisted by hunting dogs they both have the protagonist fall in love with his childhood best friend they both have epic battles like when Scar fights Simba and Bambi fights Ronno and they even both have the book ends trope! So yeah you see what I mean? And yet NO ONE has accused Lion King as being a Bambi ripoff. Not that that's what I'm saying but I'm saying they're more similar plotwise than this is to Babe. And come on even shows like Shake it Up and Dog with a Blog have higher ratings than Gordy. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER! I already wrote a review of Dog with a Blog explaining why it's awful and SHOULD have been canceled after the first season like Marvin Marvin. But no they just HAD to renew it for a season season AND a third. It better not last longer than four seasons! If Gordy was a TV show I bet it'd be rated just as high as Regular Show. OK I'm done with this before I exceed the 1000 word limit.".

	schema:headline " A Terrible and Pathetic Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Gordy is a truly terrible and pathetic movie and what's unique is that it was released right before Babe. You'd think that would've caused people to confuse the two yet Babe went on to be a huge hit and get a Best Picture nomination. That really does speak volumes about the quality of Babe.Gordy is just terrible on every level with a story that is badly put together. Gordy's a talking pig looking for his family. He first gets discovered by a little country girl who sings about checking on your butt yes it's true.One day they're at some event for a rich family. The rich little boy can't swim but instead of being scared of the water as would be normal he goes right up to the pool and sits on the diving board! And then as he's getting up he's actually surprised that he falls in. Turns out the country girl can't swim either. But wouldn't ya know it the pig can! So Gordy rescues the little rich boy and now becomes the world's richest pig.Gordy explains that all animals can really talk but only simple folks can understand them. This includes innocent children and idiot adults which becomes an ongoing gag Cousin Jake is a moron and when the pig talks to him he can understand! Ho ho! Eventually Bill Clinton calls the voice of a bad Clinton imitator and he can understand Gordy also. Ho ho! I wonder if they'd have done this same gag if Bush had been president at the time or would it have been too obvious a joke?.Although this is a silly premise at least it's something to go on but the movie doesn't know how to create a plot from it so it goes in various directions. We have clichs like the evil boyfriend who wants to marry the rich boy's mother for her money. We have a plot line where Gordy and the rich boy run away shaking off the evil boyfriend's goons but it only lasts 20 minutes. Even this can't be stretched out to 90 minutes so we have pointless scenes that're dragged out for no real reason such as the entire buttcheck song and a depressing sequence where Gordy's family is put in some cruel cockfight competition.Gordy's conversations with the rich boy feel very stilted. Of course this is because the kid not a great actor to begin with was just talking to a pig on set all day and the voice for Gordy added later does not seem to actually be talking off of him. The fact that the pig doesn't look like its actually talking does not help.So Gordy is...bad. Compared to Babe which was delightful and had a serious story Gordy is excrement which fails as entertainment.".

Other than the bright and breezy country and western soundtrack and the fact that Gordy is somewhat adorable this is rather charmless family fare. Gordy does look rather cheap not in the scenery the scenery is nice but the flat and rushed camerawork does not do it justice. The story is very predictable and never seems to find a direction the direction is sloppy the script is tedious and unfunny and a vast majority of the jokes are corny. Add some horrible acting and every barnyard clich in the book do we really need the evil boyfriend idea again and we have a film of lowquality and very little charm also even for quite a short movie it drags badly. Kids might like it but to be honest adults might find it an insult to their intelligence. 210 Bethany Cox".

Idealistic Erin Gruwell is just starting her first teaching job that as freshman and sophomore English teacher at Woodrow Wilson High School which two years earlier implemented a voluntary integration program. For many of the existing teachers the integration has ruined the school whose previously stellar academic standing has been replaced with many students who will be lucky to graduate or even be literate. Despite choosing the school on purpose because of its integration program Erin is unprepared for the nature of her classroom whose students live by generations of strict moral codes of protecting their own at all cost. Many are in gangs and almost all know somebody that has been killed by gang violence. The Latinos hate the Cambodians who hate the blacks and so on. The only person the students hate more is Ms. Gruwell. It isn't until Erin holds an unsanctioned discussion about a recent driveby shooting death that she fully begins to ...";

Regardless of how many times the same movie has been done before the white middleclass can use as many reminders as possible that education is not that easy to obtain everywhere.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film on December 13th 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.Woodrow Wilson High School is located in Long Beach California. The school is voluntarily integrated and it isn't working. The Asians the Blacks the Latinos and a very few whites not only don't get along but also stay with their own and are part of protective and violent gangs. There isn't much teaching or learning going on at the school. It is a warehouse for young teenagers until they can drop out or are kicked out.With this background an idealistic teacher Hilary Swank arrives to teach Freshmen English. She is very educated pretty middle class nonethnic welldressed and smart. From day one she doesn't fit in the classroom with these tough kids and she doesn't fit in with the faculty who have all but given up and resigned themselves to being the keepers of the student warehouse.But our idealistic teacher will not give up. She slowly and painfully tries to teach by first learning about the pain the students feel. She encourages each of her students to keep a journal of their painful and difficult life and then to share the journal with her. She also attempts to get the four ethnic groups to come together by getting them to recognize what they have in common specifically their music their movies their broken families and their broken community surroundings.While struggling with the students she has to deal at the same time with two complicated and demanding male relationships. Her husband Patrick Dempsey is often supportive but often jealous of her time commitments. Her father Scott Glenn is often disappointed of her career choice but often proud of her courage and tenacity.This story feels real. It is beautifully done. The acting of Swank Dempsey and Glenn is professional and believable. More importantly the story highlights our society's challenges in schooling the children of poor and oneparent families. The movie doesn't give miracle answers. But it does give hope. And in the end sincere effort appears to count for something  maybe everything.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.".

Of course my theater has stadium seating so someone's big head doesn't get in the way of my movie experience. And of course I had to sit in the row with the railing in front of it so I could put my feet up because I wasn't going to be uncomfortable while I play critic for this movie...what are you crazy? Then the movie began. and it ran and I was quiet. I laughed a little and cried a little but not for one second was I criticizing. As I saw the characters go through their horribly troubled lives and while I was reminded of little Anne Frank I became somewhat guilty about silently complaining that I got the squeaky seat or that my friend ate all the popcorn five minutes into the movie.Likewise when the movie was over I had nothing negative to say. It wasn't that I was biting my tongue it was that I wasn't paying attention to the mistakes of the movie wherever they were because I was so engrossed in the plot...you know the one I said had been done before. the movie made me realize that gang violence and racial intolerance are just as big issues today as EVER. And I decided that as long as people are isolated because of their race and as long as people innocently die in the midst of a gang war it's okay for this plot to live on...it gives hope to those who go to bed with one eye open and who go to school everyday wondering if they'll live to see their own graduation.And for me? For someone like me who complains about hastily eaten popcorn? It makes me count my blessings just a LITTLE bit more frequently.

But then again this was back in the 90's so it could possibly be true. I also agree that Mario puts on a good performance. For a while I forgot he was Mario. He really played his character Andre really well. The actors that played gangsters dealers really looked like gangsters and dealers so that was good too see. Also Hilary Swank looks a lot like the real Erin Gruwell so that was actually pretty cool. Overall the movie is good. Definitely better than Dangerous Minds. My grade is an A.".

But then again this was back in the 90's so it could possibly be true. I also agree that Mario puts on a good performance. For a while I forgot he was Mario. He really played his character Andre really well. The actors that played gangsters dealers really looked like gangsters and dealers so that was good too see. Also Hilary Swank looks a lot like the real Erin Gruwell so that was actually pretty cool. Overall the movie is good. Definitely better than Dangerous Minds. My grade is an A.";

The strength of this movie which is based on fact is not so much in the performance of the heroine teacher which is all one could ask for but in the focus on the pupils themselves. They come from such disturbed backgrounds from the Long Beach California of the early 90s it is a wonder some of them are still alive let alone at school. Many have lost brothers and sisters in gang warfare been abused by police mistreated by their parents and generally neglected. But when Erin Gruwell Hilary Swank provoked by the manifest racism in the class gets them to write about themselves their attitude changes from surly distain to an eagerness to learn.Naturally Ms Gruwell strikes the usual obstacles  threatened other teachers lack of money she takes on extra jobs to pay for school materials skeptical management though not much parental opposition as many are dead or in jail. Her own family is not supportive  in fact her neglected husband eventually leaves her  though her father at least has the decency to congratulate her when she succeeds. But she and the kids triumph over all of that and the kid's writing is eventually published not to mention the feature film.Once you do see what the kids are up against it is impossible not to feel the profoundest sympathy for them. Ms Gruwell's greatest achievement is to bring them to the realization that they are all  black latino Asian  brothers and sisters beneath the skin. At the end it is difficult for them to let go but they are emotionally in immeasurably better shape than on the day she walked in to the class two years earlier.Of course Ms Gruwell is not without her critics particularly Margaret Imelda Staunton her head of department and Brian John Hickey another English teacher the latter a true prick in my opinion  though both look like composite characters. They do have a point in a large public education system the goal has to be the greatest good for the greatest number and some are going to be left behind because their needs are too great. But Ms Gruwell does show that even meager resources can make a difference if intelligently deployed and the higher management has the sense not to intervene. Maybe she is going to wind up with her graduates the best writers in jail but even that's an achievement considering their background. The photo at the end of the picture suggests a great number of them survived and even thrived.Hilary Swank who has the best eager beaver manner in the business is pretty well definitive as Erin but some of the kids are stunning as well particularly April Hernandez as Eva the hardest nut to crack Jason Finn as Marcus and Deance Wyatt as Jamal. They are a bit old for their parts the kids were meant to be about 16 but their conviction carries them through. Some of them are nonprofessionals but as a group they are terrific.This will not doubt not be the last teacher feature to be made but it will go down as one of the better ones. The real hero here is education or enlightenment a hero whose praises we cannot sing enough.".

This film and Hilary Swank's lead performance in it have an honored place among those previously mentioned.If you noticed the common thread running through all the films mentioned and this one is that it seems to take a neophyte teacher to shake up the system and try something new. And that's what Hilary Swank is in Long Beach High School a newly racially mixed school where all the kids seem to be balkanized. The real miracle that was wrought in Freedom Writers is that Swank gave these kids a vision of the wider world. And that vision showed that as young people they had far more in common than the race and ethnicity that divided them. The writing came when she had them keep diaries that could be read on a volunteer basis. I had a few good teachers like Hilary Swank in my youth. Some of them were just time servers and not terribly inspirational. Those are the folks the educational system ought to treasure.I'd expect nothing less than the best from a two time Oscar winner and Ms. Swank does deliver. She gets good support from Patrick Dempsey as the husband who becomes estranged from her with her single minded devotion to her kids and from Scott Glenn as her father.What was for me the best was having those kids read about the troubles of another young person who they could relate to. That would be Anne Frank and her diary. And the meeting of Swank's class with Holocaust survivors was tender and touching indeed.I wish she'd been my teacher and given me The Diary of Anne Frank to read. Better than reading Silas Marner.".

However upon learning that the film was based on a true story it made me more interested in seeing it.Hillary Swank plays Erin Gruwell a teacher who ends up working with racially charged teens at a Long Beach California high school. She starts out with a naive mentality that all she has to do is teach them and they will care but eventually she realizes that a change to her approach will get their attention. Her discussions end up revolving around the hate and violence that plague the students' everyday lives bringing the students to realize that they have more in common than they initially thought. Along the way Gruwell must battle with conservative teachers within the school who object to her new methods of educating her students. What ends up interesting the students and where the title comes from is the notebooks they are encouraged to write in by Gruwell. She gives them the freedom to write about whatever they want and it becomes a personal journal for most.As mentioned the story has been done before but I enjoyed that the film concentrated equally on the students as well as the personal life of Cruwell. The film has plenty of emotion and is a constant reminder to those who are more fortunate than others in this world that sometimes what most of us consider horrible in our daily lives is nothing compared to others.".

And what a timely film to come out in Los Angeles when our mayor has recently gone to the Feds and asked for more money to handle the intolerable gang issues in Los Angeles.Richard LaGravenese has delivered an infectious film that deals with real issues of teachers and American education today and to watch these young students grow into productive lives as well as to see how they can learn when given the chance by a teacher who believes in them and their abilities to learn is tremendous.The music dialog and the location of Long Beach all make THE FREEDOM WRITERS click and adding in the personal history of the persecution of the Jews and Anne Frank's own diary was such a marvelous way to make the students see that their own lives were similar to others who have lost love ones to the evils of war and destruction.THE FREEDOM WRITERS like BOBBY gives a picture of what happened in the 1960's in the South and like those who lost their lives to help others these new LONG BEACH California FREEDOM WRITERS are on a path to ensure change is just not a word but an action.";

It surprised me because in my opinion it was actually better than the other movies I saw that were similar. The fact that it is a true story was one thing that made it stand out in the beginning. There is also the way The neighborhood and school is portrayed because it is very accurate to the time it depicts showing the war that was going on and the real struggles that the students had to deal with on a daily basis. The movie was so real because it was true to the way high school students act and the problems they faced not putting a facade over anything to water down the truth it shows what really happened. The actors in this movie did an amazing job. Hilary Swank led the way with a cast of not as wellknown actors who stood out and graced the big screen with their talents of conveying the truth. They added to the success of the movie and helped develop the theme of education and how it can really help people and that it isn't just some cheesy plot in an inspirational teacher movie. It was so real that it stirred up emotions in everyone at the theater I was at and I am not a person who cries at movies but this movie made me feel like crying. There are such intense moments and so many messages and truths brought out in the movie that it is really eye opening. It is a reminder that a little effort can make a big change. I would recommend that people go see it because it is a very well done movie with a brilliant storyline.".

The title is an inspiration of the Freedom Riders that traveled through he USA in the 1960s to protest segregation and suffered for the bigger good of all. The teacher and characters are all taken from these students at a Long Beach high school. The teacher was new and ideal the students were hardened mostly gang members and educators had given up on them.Hilary Swank is Erin Gruwell the new teacher. Getting little support from the school itself she took part time jobs to buy the students books take them on weekend field trips and have them start writing their own journals inspired by the Diary of Anne Frank. Eventually they all wrote letters to the Austrian lady still alive who had hidden Anne Frank and raised enough money to have her fly to meet their class.The point of the movie is to show that in spite of the difficulties you happen to be in you still have choices and you can choose to accept others with differences and choose a different path for your life.Good story outstanding acting.".

A touching and socially important message that has unfortunately been told millions of times before and was unable to bring anything new to the audience watching it. We are only truly touched by this story when we are reminded that it is based on actual events otherwise it seems like old news that has been pumped out over and over again by Hollywood.Hillary Swanks performance could only be described as meh. Apparently she is only truly talented when it comes to playing boys or socially awkward people. Her performance reminded me a lot of my teachers in high school ambitious and important but overall pretty boring and dull.The backstories and the performances of the students I found to be quite interesting. April Hernandez was beautiful as Eva and I really believed the transformation that her character went through. There were some parts of the plot that bothered me though I found the situation with her husband predictable in a bad way and I felt like it was an aspect of the story that was not totally seen through by the filmmaking team. They put it in for the sake of putting it in and it did not get the respect it deserved. They should have left it out completely or better developed the idea and the emotions surrounding it.It was overall a decent story but I wasn't thrilled or moved to tears. The acting was good but the characters were way too typical each one was very classic and had been done before thousands of times. It would definitely be good for children maybe middle school aged to watch and it wasn't a total waste of my time so if you feel like being entertained for a little with a good ol' fashion inner city kids get their lives turned around movie then this one should get added to your list of ones to watch.".

I gasped several times and I screamed onceloud! I wanted to stay inside the theater for the next showing!! The theater was filled with a few children many teenagers and young adults married couplesparents and several elderly people anyone can benefit from this movie to the max.

LBUSD was integrated a very very long time before this teacher taught for a few years. That aside it is racist to assert that integration had anything to do with the problems at LB Wilson. It was my experience that integration enriched my experience. The problems asserted in this film were fictional. LB Wilson is ofter referred to as the gem of the district. It is a great and beautiful HS in the Belmont Heights neighborhood which is adjacent to Belmont Shore. So this ghetto theme they were passing off is a lie.Rudy was a fun movie  I've seen it many times. But it was filled with lies. But it is fun so I can live with the Rudy Ruettiger exaggerations. In other words I can overlook serious gaps in truth or logic if they're replaced with great writing scenery and acting. Freedom Writers failed in every regard. That is Freedom Writers delivered the lies and nothing else. It is my suspicion that a publicist was hard at work spinning this story.I watched only 30 minutes before pulling the disk  I couldn't stand anymore. Speaking of standing if you want to watch an inspirational movie about public school teaching in underserved areas of Los Angeles watch Stand and Deliver. Jaime Escalante's multidecade teaching career offers substantially more credibility over a teacher that lasted a couple or few years.".

Not only were the story lines implemented within the film very powerful and hearttouching but they were believable and not so over the top. The humor was really smart too which was a big plus.

	schema:reviewBody "If you are craving a nonstop action movie with a decent plot and acting go no further than MI3. Tom Cruise reprises the role of Ethan Hunt IMF agent extraordinaire who is attempting to leave the IMF field work to others as he takes over training of new agents. Can he stand it? Of course not! or the movie would've ended in 10 minutes!He's engaged to marry Michelle Monaghan as his fiance Julia. I think their chemistry was pretty good. I recently watched her in Source Code and she's a terrific actress. At an engagement party Ethan gets a call and next thing you know he's back in the field. He just has that itch and needs to scratch it. Cruise does a decent acting job of a guy torn between two worlds where he wants to be just another normal guy but his whole team is telling him that he can't have a normal life. His team delivers particularly Ving Rhames who is so Mr. Cool. Also Maggie Q has a unique ability to blend in as nobody special but be made to be very sexy when needed. Jonathan Rhyss Myers was standard. I saw him in Bend it Like Beckham and he's OK as an actor. Laurence Fishburne delivers as a mega boss type guy who takes no crap or bs from anyone. And finally Billy Crudup as Cruise's mission chief who aids and abets Cruise outside the authority of officialdom. The plot is pretty simple good guys against bad guys. Phillipe S. Hoffman absolutely delivers as evil sadistic feelingless arms dealer Owen Davian who sells anything to anyone for a price with no concern about anyone. Hoffman RIP has some tremendous scenes with Cruise where they go toe to toe in life or death struggles. Whoa those scenes are really intense emotionally and physically.The action spans the globe from the US to Germany to Italy to China and back. At a little over 2 hours the film is nicely paced. There are no real down moments where you feel the movie drags  it's nonstop. At the end you don't really care about the Rabbit's Foot as much as you do about how it's going to go down. Just strap yourself in and enjoy this fine installment to the MI series. Enjoy.".

I was kind of hoping for a few more lines from Phillip Seymour Hoffman but he still played an excellent villain.As far as story line goes...I'd rate the trilogy this way. 1st movie 3rd movie and then dead last is the 2nd.As far as action...I'd rate this 3rd installment as the best!

To aid him are Ving Rhames Jonathon RhysMeyers and Maggie Q and this being a third there are gadgets explosions sets and plot twists like now other.You've got to hand it to Abrams  he certainly knows how to keep an audience on their toes. Drawing on a few of his popular plot devices from Lost flashbacks a crescendo to the turning point he sets us up neatly into his little world where Ethan Hunt is now a man trying to live a normal life. Whilst that scenario may be a hard to buy this is redeemed by the many action scenes in the film which are each exhilarating. To go into detail would be spoiling it but let's just say there is an extremely breathtaking sequence involving a fulcrum an amusing one involving Tom Cruise disguising himself as someone and lastly but by no means least a helicopter chase which is utterly aweinspiring and barely lets the audience pause for breath. All this and you get a Michael Giacchino score that perfectly blends action anxiety fear and anger.The cast in themselves are a treat. Tom Cruise though not given the most trying of tasks in playing an action hero does a good job with his usual intensity. In the action scenes his facial expressions are concentrated and focused and utterly convincing. However Cruise fails in having any genuine chemistry with Michelle Monaghan for and the romance comes across as rather bland. This is not aided with the poor writing in these scenes. Ving Rhames Jonathan RhysMeyers and Maggie Q merely look cool as his helpers and Laurence Fisburne and Billy Crudup successfully bring that edge of moral ambiguity to their characters. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellently malicious as the elusive and extremely dangerous Davian shining in his lizardeyed role and bringing some genuine terror to the villain. His scenes aside Tom Cruise are superb as they practically tremble in tension and quiet hatred on both characters parts.You will go to see Mission Impossible III expecting some grandscale set pieces and you will not be disappointed here. Each one of the four is masterfully executed with a breezy slickness that is both cool and exciting. We're talking nonstop action occasionally interspersed with those corny Hollywood love formulae cruising as emotion. Its big its bombastic and it could be the Summer blockbuster of the year.".

Here is a movie filled with action and nothing more. There are the usual Tom Cruise running and getting banged up high degrees of improbability explosions gadgets the whole shebang. Still MIIII is a fastpaced thriller that manages to get hold of you for the 120minute span of its running hour and never lets go.After retiring as Impossible Missions Force IMF team leader to lead a normal life with his fiance Julia Michelle Monaghan Ethan Hunt Cruise returns to the team to help recapture criminal arms dealer Owen Davian Philip Seymour Hoffman who has escaped from prison and is now making life difficult for the IMF. As for Hunt his encounter with Davian has upped the ante for him he not only has to save the world now he also has to save the woman he loves. Cruise either you love him or you hate him still fits into his role well and Hoffman who has just won an Oscar for his portrayal of Truman Capote also effectively displays a chilling seriousness to his villain role. The rest of the cast  Billy Crudup Ving Rhames Maggie Q Michelle Monaghan etc.  all give nice performances.It's a given that this film would offer little in terms of intellect or depth in the script. Yet the way director J.J. Abrams and his cowriters injected humor and emotions plus how its action scenes were superbly handled save MIIII from becoming just another passable popcorn movie which is why I liked it. It is a film intended solely for the purpose of escapism and it achieves that purpose. Although there is a feeling that it could have been more it easily surpasses the first two MI in an explosively stylish way.".

Overall the photography is slick. It's a good visual movie. Not only the cinematography but the director did a nice job with many of these shots. The version doesn't have all the gimmicks the first Misssion Impossible film but it certainly has the best action scenes. The only bad movie of the three MIs was the second one. This one makes up for that.All the characters are interesting. Philip Seymour Hoffman as usual is excellent as the main villain Owen Damien. Michelle Monaghan makes for an attractive fiance of Cruise in this movie but her role is not a major one. Cruise's team is fun to watch a PC group consisting of a white guy black guy and Asian woman.The action is improbable as Cruise's Ethan Hunt would have to be Superman to perform the stunts and acrobatics he does here. I would never claim this movie is credible or even intelligent  just escapist fun.Just put your brains on hold and go along for the wild ride.

The action really is nonstop and there aren't any cheesy love scenes slowing anything down. The bad guy doesn't change every five minutes either. The plot moves quickly but it doesn't lose the audience at all. You don't need to have seen either of the first two to understand what is going on I can't remember the plot from either. Lots of guns loud explosions cool gadgets and fun locations. I can remember on more than one occasion where the audience clapped or reacted to the action.

Some real surprises early in the flick start things off fast and it keeps up the pace pretty well from there on. Sure it's mostly sameold sameold but it was fun and actionpacked. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was fine as a villain but was really not even in the movie that much. Tom Cruise was just Tom Cruise as usual but for two hours I was able to forget about all his offscreen stupidity. You know what this really felt like? 24 The Movie. ...which they are apparently going to make. It should end up being much like MI3 and I think that'd be just fine.".

Some real surprises early in the flick start things off fast and it keeps up the pace pretty well from there on. Sure it's mostly sameold sameold but it was fun and actionpacked. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was fine as a villain but was really not even in the movie that much. Tom Cruise was just Tom Cruise as usual but for two hours I was able to forget about all his offscreen stupidity. You know what this really felt like? 24 The Movie. ...which they are apparently going to make. It should end up being much like MI3 and I think that'd be just fine.";

He wants to know where an item called the 'Rabbit's Foot' is and if Ethen doesn't tell him by the time he counts to ten he will kill his wife! When he reaches ten we hear a shot then cut to the opening credits. When he film restarts it is some time before the opening and Ethan now retired from front line duty and engaged is called back to rescue an agent he trained who has been captured by Davian. This sets in motion a series of events that will take Ethan and his team to Berlin the Vatican and finally to Shanghai where the opening confrontation is destined to take place.Once again the series gains a new director J.J. Abrams and anybody who watched his TV series 'Alias' will be used to the device of opening with a scene that comes from near the end of the story a device that works because it gets the viewer wondering how we will get there and more importantly how it will be resolved. From beginning to end there is plenty of exciting action including gunfights leaping from buildings and the almost mandatory exploding helicopter! Rather than the highly choreographed action of the previous film this feels rougher and more painful. The plot isn't exactly complicated but that doesn't matter it is all about the ride. Tom Cruise and the regular cast put in good performances and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman is suitably unpleasant as the sadistic Davian. Overall it may be very farfetched and a little predictable but that doesn't matter as it is a lot of fun if you enjoyed the first two films you are sure to like this.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you walk into a movie expecting to be blown away by death defying  stunts and tremendous special effects it's easy to be disappointed.  What a monumental task directors had in making MI3 even more  overthetop and more spectacular than the first two. Mission  Accomplished. Sorry.  Tom Cruise takes Ethan Hunt to new heights. Fishbourne is great as the  ambiguously dirty IMF leader. But the best actor in the movie is Philip  Seymour Hoffman. Not many actors can take a role that's more  onedimensional than Doctor Evil and turn it into a deeply layered  performance. From an acting standpoint there was almost a feeling that  he was too good for this movie and the actors around him. He doesn't  breathe the same air as this cast not even Tom Cruise.  The women in the movie are a dichotomy. On the one hand you have Bahar  Soomekh an unknown actress who kicks ass and takes names on par with  the bad boys Cruise and Ving Rhames. On the other you have Keri  Russell in a part we've seen too many times in this kind of movie. The  wideeyed innocent who becomes the villain's prize and the hero's  salvation. Keri Russell and Michelle Monaghan spend most of this movie  tied to a chair. I hope they're not method actresses. They would have  to spend the last year of filming at home bound and gagged in the  kitchen. At least they made Monaghan a doctor so we know she's smart  even if she's so nave she thinks her husband works for the department  of transportation.   Forget the love story forget the corruption at IMF forget the plot  entirely. None of it matters. All that matters is how are we going to  get in and how are we going to get out and the magnificent twists  and turns that follow. Some action movies spend way too much time  milking the set up of a weak script before the explosions and the  stunts finally kick in. Others dull your senses with one mindless  montage of violence and car chases without a point to be found. MI3  walks the line perfectlythe story is simple enough to understand but  wellthought out enough to not poke gaping holes in it. Now let's get  to the action.   MI3 manages the action sequences smartly expertly getting your heart  rate and hopes up and then bring you crashing back down to earth. The  thrill of victory the agony of defeat followed by a 10 minutes of  blah blah blah.   You shouldn't get married Ving says to Tom in the middle of a  dangerous operation. You know guys who do what we do can't be  married. By the way this is another wellworn action film technique.  Inject casual talk between principals during the most intense and  dangerous scenes. It shows that they're so highlyskilled and  confident they can chat nonchalantly about relationships while in the  middle of an elaborate Vatican City breakin. Thank you Quentin. Thank  you Bruce Willis. But the breaks in the action work. They give you a  chance to buy into the suspense each time from your feet up.  Acknowledging that you're drained from the previous sequence they give  you time to catch your breath and then come at you all over again.  The airtoground assault on the Washington Bridge is astounding.  Cruise attempting to catapult between two skyscrapers in Shanghais is  beyond belief. Watching him descend way too fast from said skyscraper  in a flimsy parachute knowing he's going to crash down onto the busy  freeway and immediately be run over by a gas tanker? Priceless.   Remarkable stunts solid acting and a villain that may be the best  ever in this genre Hoffman makes MI3 the best of the series and maybe  the best action movie ever made. Until 4 that is.".

We all might be sick of the whole TomKat media infatuation but one thing that I am not sick of is his movies. The man makes decent movies and that is what we pay our money for anyway. If you are using everything you hear as an excuse to boycott this don't because you would be missing an entertaining movie.Ethan Hunt has retired as an active agent in IMF but he has stayed on to train new field agents.

To safely get her back Ethan must go retrieve the Rabbit's Foot. Ethan Hunt does retrieve the Rabbit's Foot but loses it. Ethan Hunt still saves Julia though without even being able to retrieve the Rabbit's Foot.Mission Impossible III is a great start to the summer movie season. From the first scene to the very last Mission Impossible III grabbed me by the hair and never let go. The action is not too over the top were you are thinking You have got to be kidding me like it was in Mission Impossible II. The opening scene which I will not go too into is very intense and made me want more. A rescue mission was the first of the big action sequences. There are other action scenes too like an explosive battle on a bridge which is shown in the trailers which will not disappoint action movie fans. When I was watching this I was thinking to myself I hope I don't have to use the restroom during this movie. What I liked most is that this was more of a team effort then the previous ones especially Mission Impossible II and in order to do that you need a good cast which this had. Tom Cruise is well Tom Cruise I mean Ethan Hunt there is nothing more I can say about that. He does carry this movie but not as much as the other two Mission Impossible movies. This is what makes it much better then Mission Impossible II. Philip Seymour Hoffman stole the show as Owen Davian he was very threatening and villainous. Michelle Monaghan played Ethan Hunt's fiance Julia. Ethan and her had had some chemistry together but it does not seem hard since Michelle Monaghan at times looked like a Katie Holmes clone. Maggie Q who plays Zhen Lei and Keri Russell who plays Lindsey Farris were both butt kicking females which JJ Abrams the cowriterdirector is very familiar with because of Alias. Lawrence Fishburne and Billy Crudup played Ethan's bosses John Brassel and Musgrave which were very likable. Ving Rhames returns from the other films as Luther Stikell and he gave a nice performance as a familiar face. Jonathan Rhys Meyers had a nice role as the transportation expert Declan. Simon Pegg had some humorous lines as Benji Dunn an IMF Technician that assists Ethan Hunt.Another cool thing is that the movie kept it open for a fourth installment. So why does this movie keep it open for a fourth? It is because the Rabbit's Foot was never revealed. The audience does not know what the Rabbit's Foot is. In a way this is a negative though since there was so much emphasis on finding the Rabbit's Foot that not discovering it is was a little disappointing. I picture a fourth movie dealing with understanding what the Rabbit's Foot is and what it does. JJ Abrams did a great job. I expected this to be more like Mission Impossible II where it is more of a brainless action movie then anything else. Instead this was a realistic spy movie along the lines of the first Mission Impossible. It was not only a brainless action film but a brainless action film with twists and a decent plot. This had an Alias type feel to it which was not a bad thing. JJ Abrams proved that he could do more then just direct popular television series like Alias and Lost he is a motion picture director as well. I cannot wait to see what his future brings up! Overall this is a lot better then Mission Impossible II and just about up to par with Mission Impossible. I definitely recommend watching this at least once. This has a lot of action suspense good supporting cast and an engaging plot. This is a must see regardless of your thoughts of Tom Cruise!".

I recall in the first movie that the use of the theme over the final action sequence its only use in the film brought the loudest ovation I've ever heard in a movie theater.That sequence illustrates the problem with the movies better than anything.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie on DVD yesterday Saturday at the time of writing after having seen the sequel Mission Impossible  Ghost Protocol and not remembering certain developments in the main character's Ethan Hunt played by Tom Cruise life. I know that I'd seen the first two movies...must have missed this third one...perhaps because I didn't like its predecessor that much...or something I watched the 4th in the series because the cinema chain showing it gave you the chance to win a car if you booked a ticket online...ah marketing!.Anyway this movie does indeed fill in the missing pieces from the 4th in the series. It concerns a romantically entangled Ethan Hunt no longer working in the field for the IMF organisation his love interest's reaction to what that acronym stands for pretty much spoke for me! and now working there part time as a trainer of would be field agents. Of course the IMF comes calling on him again to help out in a mission to rescue an agent he trained who has been kidnapped the beautiful Keri Russell as field agent Lindsey Farris...the IMF seems to have impossibly high beauty standards for new recruits!.Predictably things go pear shaped and soon Ethan Hunt has to deal with a mysterious shadowy figure called Owen Davian played coldly and malevolently by Philip Seymour Hoffman...a chilling performance as a truly nasty piece of work. Davian is seeking to sell something of unimaginable value...and possibly something of great power.The best thrillstension comes from when Ethan is stretched to his limits trying to save the women he cares for.The beautiful Michelle Monaghan perhaps has a thankless role unless she had posters of Tom on her wall while growing up! playing Ethan's love interest Julia Meade. She is suitably adorable.Watching this movie I did get some odd moments with it...where I wasn't engrossed in the proceedings...like  Ethan Hunt cracking a smile near the end of the movie...no doubt that is the 'money shot' for Tom Cruise's female fans...I can imagine the director wheedling that out of him with a Come on Tom! Show us those pearly whites!. Near the end of the movie there's a moment which comes across as comedic concerning some extraordinary measure which must be taken to stop Ethan from dying...maybe everyone knows it's all a bit silly really but maybe Tom just doesn't pull off those many moments where he has to emote in this movie...his expression in that scene comes across as something from a teen comedy.To close the DVD I watched has some extras including deleted scenes. There was a good action scene missing from the movie featuring the beautiful Maggie Q as Ethan's field agent partner Zhen Lei. Hmm...I was watching a scene in the Vatican in the movie...she wears a very revealing dress...I played a scene slowly where she reaches for an item hidden near her leg...something struck me as 'weird'...had a look higher up on Zhen's body...the 'weird' thing was her underwear! I sort of got the impression that she had been digitally altered in some way...haven't seen Basic Instinct...but I was thinking in that direction...don't think anything was digitally altered though...it's just that in trying not have distracting underwear for the actress it actually proved a distraction! Watching the making of featurette did also remind me of another couple of instances I utilised the slow motion ability of my machine...there are two scenes where Ethan and Lindsey pirouette together in action sequences...apparently Tom went for that ostentatious move...it definitely does catch the eye though. It also seems that a middle aged behind the scenes woman who is interviewed is not credited...have no idea who she was!".

	schema:headline " This isn't MI3 it's MI and the first worthy to carry that name.";
	schema:reviewBody "I agree with most of the posted comments it's easily the best of the three and I think the secret recipe this time is J.J. Abrams. Producer Cruise has surrounded himself with talented actors before Henry Czerny Jon Voight Vanessa Redgrave in MI and Anthony Hopkins and Dougray Scott in MI 2 and it didn't work so well. He chose a vacuous hole as an actress for MI 2 Newton so we don't buy the romance. He chose two talented directors DePalma and Woo who have done far better work elsewhere and it didn't help. Robert Towne did work in both scripts and his contribution didn't turn the movie into a cohesive whole. Both movies were a mess with some great parts and a lot of bad parts.J.J. Abrams has had years of work doing spy drama in Alias and he seems to recognize how to bring the movie back to its roots.I mean essentially that's what the TV series was they had a mission and they'd carry it out in the most convoluted way possible and the suspense was how they'd pull it off despite the million of things that could go wrong.Abrams is like a magician. He knows the main plot is hokey so he has techniques to misdirect the audience so we won't be poking sticks into the plot holes and we essentially buy the drama.It also helps he brings in his own IMF team to make MI 3 his scriptwriters from Alias plus the fact he also writes scripts.

	onyx:emotionText "I agree with most of the posted comments it's easily the best of the three and I think the secret recipe this time is J.J. Abrams. Producer Cruise has surrounded himself with talented actors before Henry Czerny Jon Voight Vanessa Redgrave in MI and Anthony Hopkins and Dougray Scott in MI 2 and it didn't work so well. He chose a vacuous hole as an actress for MI 2 Newton so we don't buy the romance. He chose two talented directors DePalma and Woo who have done far better work elsewhere and it didn't help. Robert Towne did work in both scripts and his contribution didn't turn the movie into a cohesive whole. Both movies were a mess with some great parts and a lot of bad parts.J.J. Abrams has had years of work doing spy drama in Alias and he seems to recognize how to bring the movie back to its roots.I mean essentially that's what the TV series was they had a mission and they'd carry it out in the most convoluted way possible and the suspense was how they'd pull it off despite the million of things that could go wrong.Abrams is like a magician. He knows the main plot is hokey so he has techniques to misdirect the audience so we won't be poking sticks into the plot holes and we essentially buy the drama.It also helps he brings in his own IMF team to make MI 3 his scriptwriters from Alias plus the fact he also writes scripts.

I particularly liked the running gag of Blank's response to the inevitable what do you do for a living? question a completely matteroffact professional killer which of course not one person takes seriously. I also loved the hilariously neurotic exchanges between Blank  his hounded shrink Arkin who ends every conversation with Don't kill anyone! There's also a lovely little story involving a pen...The film is also a great action flick  it has some brilliantly choreographed  executed gunfight  handtohand fight sequences  in fact some of the best I've ever seen. Cusack looks or at least is made to look like a pretty decent athlete himself. The finale is a real tourdeforce  for me sums up the movie itself a great gunfight clever  hilariously funny.This film is wonderful from start to finish  if you haven't done so already see it now!".

He doesn't wink at the audience saying Oh look I'm a hitman but plays him as normal with the right amount of misgivings and tenacity. Minnie Driver is quite good as the woman he's still obsessed with although she was good in GOOD WILL HUNTING she should have been nominated for this performance and Alan Arkin and Jeremy Piven were good as ever in support.  The surprise however is Dan Aykroyd.  Just when I was prepared to write him off forever he comes through with a great performance here. The soundtrack is terrific too avoiding the cliched 80's songs to provide a fresh and compatible score.".

Martin Blank Cusack is an angst ridden international hitman who has stopped enjoying his work. He searches for meaning in his life and returns to Grosse Pointe Michigan for his 10th year High School reunion and one last job. Blank meets his mom some old friends and discovers that his childhood home has been knocked down to make way for a convenience store. He ponders his life choices and has recurring dreams about Debi Newberry Driver the girl he stood up on Prom night. Blank's activities have attracted a collection of hit men trying to find an excuse to kill him. These include Aykroyd two federal agents and a freelance Basque hitman. There is a shootout at the end and overall the film has a large body count but Cusack makes Blank seem like a lovable version of Jason Bourne. The film is something of an ensemble piece with great comic performances from Alan Arkin Joan Cusack Jeremy Piven and Aykroyd. The film pokes fun at the loner tough guy hero featured in so many Hollywood movies. At the time of its release the story was a little unusual but Mr and Mrs Smith has since explored similar territory of rich cosmopolitan assassins trying to blend into ordinary American life. Blank spends most of the movie in pursuit of Debi. Will she forgive him? Will he have time to complete his assignment? This is my idea of a great movie. It's funny and clever and the characters are flawed but likable.".

He's fast becoming one of my favorite actors besides Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington amongst others.School reunions are one of those social events that you either love or loathe. If you're a somebody back then and are sort of somebody right now it presents to you an opportunity to brag about it. If you're cruising along fine then you're probably curious about how others are doing and want to take stock. If you're a nobody then or now then you'll probably not want to attend at all.John Cusack plays Martin Blank a professional hitman whose at the crossroads of that decision. 10 years ago he abandoned his date for the prom and never made contact ever since. Also he's wondering how he could possibly tell anyone about his current profession. He's also finding that life is becoming meaningless and is seeking for something to lift him up from the doldrums.His secretary played by real life sister Joan Cusack  there are a total of 4 Cusack siblings in this movie arranges a perfect opportunity for him to mesh work and play and packs him off back to Grosse Pointe. Naturally he seeks out his old flame Debi Newberry Minnie Driver and tries his best to make amends by offering to go to the reunion with her.However his nemesis and hitman rival Grocer played to hilarity by Dan Ackroyd is mad at Blank for not wanting to join up in his union and he wants to bump Blank off. He's provided with some of the best dialog and banters with Cusack so well you just beg for more of their scenes together.It's a quirky movie aren't most of Cusack's movies which is thoroughly enjoyable with its excellent selection of songs wonderful dialog and delightful action toward the end. Watch out too for a short appearance by Jenna Elfman! The Code 1 DVD is nothing to shout about  the bare bones version.".

John Cusack is excellent as the hitman he just seems to bring the character to life and play him in a jokey way without making fun of the film Dan Akroyd gets the best role he's had in years as the hitman trying to get Cusack to join his union while Minnie Driver is girly and fun  the whole cast are excellent in fact!The film is not a classic by any means and many see it as a down side that it ignores any serious issues or that the film is set so far away from reality but for me this is part of the fun.  Sit down don't take it seriously and just enjoy the ride!".

This is strictly a comedy  there's no deep soul searching here the analyst is also in it for comedy value.The story is funny and lively the soundtrack reminded us that not all 80's music was rubbish and the whole feel of the film is one that it must have been fun to make.  John Cusack is excellent as the hitman he just seems to bring the character to life and play him in a jokey way without making fun of the film Dan Akroyd gets the best role he's had in years as the hitman trying to get Cusack to join his union while Minnie Driver is girly and fun  the whole cast are excellent in fact!The film is not a classic by any means and many see it as a down side that it ignores any serious issues or that the film is set so far away from reality but for me this is part of the fun.  Sit down don't take it seriously and just enjoy the ride!";

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes one bad apple ruins the whole thing. One drop of taint makes the best things in life go bad. An this movie was full of potential taint. It could have been Minnie Driver the weak point of Good Will Hunting. It could have been Dan Ackroyd whose comedic routines can go from great in Ghostbusters to stupid in Coneheads. Or maybe it could even have been the fact the writers and director really have no prior experience in making a big film. But the potential taint never happened and this film came out almost flawless.Minnie Driver was given such a small role that her poor acting and unbelievable character which I guess isn't her fault could be overlooked and placed in the margin. Not her worst performance but not her best which might be Beautiful.Dan Ackroyd was superb actually presenting us one of the funnier yet darker villains in cinematic history. His delivery of Bible verses while shooting willynilly through a target's house? Diabolical! The directing was respectable and the writing was spoton. Some great dialog between the characters and the story could not be beat. Seriously.The Cusacks? Oh my! John Cusack is a winner in everything he's ever done besides maybe One Crazy Summer. This movie is one of his best almost as memorable as Say Anything though that one is flatly unbeatable. Joan Cusack was also pretty cool as a receptionist and her rapport with John is clear and shines in the film. I'm not buying a phone from her though. And John's sparring with his kickboxing instructor? Those lessons have paid off! Jeremy Piven? Stupendous as good if not better than his Chasing Liberty role. Having starred in 10 films with John Cusack this is probably their best together.There are so many more praises I could heap on this movie but I shouldn't have to. If you want to see a funny quirky and wellcrafted tale about a professional hitman and a high school reunion this is your film of choice. You might rent Michelle and Romy but not only will you not get the hit men but you'll get a piece of dog doo as well. So choose wisely.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by George Armitage Grosse Pointe Blank stars John Cusack as Martin Blank a neurotic hitman who has spent the last ten years of his life stuck in an existential rut. As such Blank spends most his time contemplating the meaning of life reading magazines titled making sense of creation and brooding about the perceived pointless of all existence. If life has no worth Blank muses then why not profit from killing?In true Woody Allen fashion Blank discusses all these issues with his psychiatrist played brilliantly by Allan Arkin. He's searching for some meaning anything to fill a certain existential void an emotional rollercoaster which Cusack has made a career out of conveying. Indeed Cusack made a name for himself in the 1980s playing wisecracking teenagers who struggle with adulthood are contemptuous of others and posses an inner wisdom. You might say Blank takes these characters and pushes them toward sociopathy.Cusack has always been cool but here he oozes ultracool ever body motion mannerism and gesture finetuned. The film offers an endless stream of witty dialogue numerous neat subtle touches Blank is very picky about where he sits a killer soundtrack and a hilarious subplot featuring Dan Aykroyd as a fasttalking overweight hitman. Aykroyd's attempting to set up a hitman trade union Solidarity! but Blank's not interested in joining. The duo share a priceless scene in a caf both men with weapons hidden under a table.Bizarrely Grosse Pointe marries at least six genres. It's a highschool reunion movie an assassin flick a returntosmalltown movie a romantic comedy action film and 1980s teen nostalgia flick. Armitage handles the tropes of all these genres well but outdoes himself with the film's many action sequences. They're surprisingly well choreographed particularly an intense fistfight with famed martial artist Benny Urquidez.Much of the film plays like a 1980s teen flick. Here Minnie Driver's the object of Blank's affection she playing the girl Blank abandoned 10 years earlier at a high school dance. Blank's attempting to reconnect with her as a means of escaping what is essentially a stasis borne of nihilism and apathy a fact which gives the film's eighties nostalgia some touching subtext. Blank wants to mend his childhood to start over but the universe won't let him. In the end it's Driver who embraces Blank's philosophy though Blank changes a little too. In one scene holding a baby whilst Queen waffles on the soundtrack ...dares you to change your way of caring.... Blank learns something about the fragility and preciousness of life. Seconds later he kills a guy and dumps the body in a furnace. Baby steps.The film's romantic climax is rushed and unconvincing and Minnie Driver irks with the facial bone structure of a caveman. Still Grosse Pointe is some kind of classic and in a way continues the evolution of the hitman genre from Yojimbo to Le Samourai to The Professional 1980 to Nikita to Leon to Ghost Dog to Grosse Pointe Blank. Here Cusack acts as a sort of deconstruction of the Hitman. No longer is he an angel of death Melville's film or a mentally damaged human but a totally selfaware thoroughly postmodern neurotic wreck. The film completely autopsies the genre which will probably lead to a lot of noble somber stable and righteous hitman movies in the future. Every genre's eventually reset.910  Cult classic. See High Fidelity and Pump Up The Volume.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a confused movie this is. Is it a comedy? A Pulp Fiction wannabe? A John Hughes Eighties High School movie? It tries to be all three but in doing that it fails to be what it needs to be a good movie.It's very Pulp Fictionish in its use of witty banter during extreme gunplay. The John Hughes element is obvious...Cusack could even be the same character from Better Off Dead ten years later. In fact THAT would have been funny but I digress.If it's an action movie I think Cusack and Aykroyd are miscast. Maybe not Cusack so much but Aykroyd just sucks. As in most action movies the characters use their guns like hoses and only reload after 50 shots have been fired from a pistol that holds 10 bullets.The romance is not convincing. There's just no chemistry between Driver and Cusack and not much time is spent on them. Nor is enough time spent with Cusack's old school friends and enemies which could have been fodder for a better movie.Particularly shocking is the violence in this supposed comedy. SPOILERS Cusack's encounter with the ghoul in the school ends disturbingly in my opinion. And I have no problem with violence...Pulp Fiction was great but of course it wasn't marketing itself as a comedy! And the gunning down of the two NSA agents at the end just makes no sense and didn't seem to even fit with where the movie was supposed to go.

	onyx:emotionText "What a confused movie this is. Is it a comedy? A Pulp Fiction wannabe? A John Hughes Eighties High School movie? It tries to be all three but in doing that it fails to be what it needs to be a good movie.It's very Pulp Fictionish in its use of witty banter during extreme gunplay. The John Hughes element is obvious...Cusack could even be the same character from Better Off Dead ten years later. In fact THAT would have been funny but I digress.If it's an action movie I think Cusack and Aykroyd are miscast. Maybe not Cusack so much but Aykroyd just sucks. As in most action movies the characters use their guns like hoses and only reload after 50 shots have been fired from a pistol that holds 10 bullets.The romance is not convincing. There's just no chemistry between Driver and Cusack and not much time is spent on them. Nor is enough time spent with Cusack's old school friends and enemies which could have been fodder for a better movie.Particularly shocking is the violence in this supposed comedy. SPOILERS Cusack's encounter with the ghoul in the school ends disturbingly in my opinion. And I have no problem with violence...Pulp Fiction was great but of course it wasn't marketing itself as a comedy! And the gunning down of the two NSA agents at the end just makes no sense and didn't seem to even fit with where the movie was supposed to go. The movie could have been FUNNY if Cusack's character was a bumbling hitman not an expert assassin. But hey that's just my opinion.";

It sounds promising and as with all Cusack movies has a great soundtrack and some pretty good lines.  But I had a very hard time believing that Cusack was a hit man.  He always strikes me as somebody trying very hard to be cool but can't quite pull it off.  The only other person that I would have an even harder time seeing as a professional killer would be...Dan Aykroyd.  His performance as a psychopath is even harder to watch.  This movie was also too violent.  I know that it is a black comedy and some other good comedies are more violent but in this one the violent scenes seem to belong in another movie.  The ending is particularly unsettling with Cusack and his snappy patter blowing away the bad guys.  The only thing that keeps this movie from sinking into the really bad movie morass is the aforementioned soundtrack and a nice performance from the always welcome Alan Arkin.".

Frankly I found this movie a drag from start to finish.It had potential. There was a reasonably good cast headed by Cusack and Dan Aykroyd playing Grocer his archrival in the hitman business along with Minnie Driver as Debi Blank's high school sweetheart who he stood up on prom night and a limited role for Alan Arkin as Dr. Oatman Blank's psychologist. That fairly talented cast never really seemed to come together though. The drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humour. What I thought had the most potential to be a comedic storyline was Grocer's proposal for a hit man's union but aside from becoming a bit of a running joke the idea never really got developed. As for the romance one wondered why Debi would even think of letting this guy back into her life.There were a handful of chuckles but nothing really caught me and held me and I spent most of the movie wondering whether this thing was ever going to start to click.

So when I watch the stories that they are involved in I am always curious what they will play out like. I truly enjoyed the sharpwitted and fasteronthetrigger agile hitman that John proved to be in Grosse Point Blank.I like the way he is thinking about his life and pondering what it is that he is doing now and will do in the future. He doesn't misfocus either. Even under heavy handed pressure from the competition. Sincerely Dr. Oatman Arkin is masterfully the frustrated out of answers for the patient Psychiatrist that he has run out of patience with that patient and never really wanted in the first place.

He shows strength in his character's direction and yet he is sympathetic and brings compassion to a dead drunk loser from his high school education's past. Piven adds a funny edge to the story as his old buddy from school Paul Spericki the wild real estate pot smoking old time stories from the past good time pal! Who is a misdirected coward at heart.

Answers to a dark mystery he has been living with for years.The only reason I did not give this 10 out of 10 and I probably should have considering the well thought out character development and story etc was Ackroyd's Grocer's 'fouler than that'mouth.

	schema:reviewBody "First things first Hitchcock's 'The 39 Steps' is and always will be a classic of the British cinema and Ralph Thomas's remake it's unashamedly a remake rather than an adaptation of the novel fails to equal it. However once you get past that fact on its own terms this is rather an enjoyable little movie.Kenneth More is one of my favourite performers perhaps not the greatest actor in the world but one who has a charismatic personality. If he doesn't quite equal Robert Donat's original 'Richard Hannay' he comes close and invests the role with genuine warmth. Taina Elg's foreign heroine however though very attractive is no Madeleine Carroll and is perhaps the movie's weakest link.The stars are backed up by a splendid cast of familiar British character actors ranging from Sid James's cameo as a truck driver to Brenda De Banzie's turn as a friendly manhungry roadside caf owner.Another plus is the glorious Scottish locations genuine this time as opposed to the original's studio mockups filmed in luscious 'Eastmancolor'.All in all while Ralph Thomas is no Alfred Hitchcock but then there's only one Hitch the remake is ideal entertainment perfect viewing for a dark winter's night curled up in your armchair with hot coffee and toast by your side.".

	schema:reviewBody "Often criticised for being a shotforshot remake of the Hitchcock original this film is in fact a perky little thriller which benefits from Kenneth More being a more sympathetic leading man than Robert Donat he was somewhat aloof in the '39 version. True the film trades heavily off the script for the Hitchcock version and true it does not go back to the original novel for context spirit or historical setting in the way the '78 version does but for me the film is the jewel among the three. As well as a pacy and fun thriller it catches the spirit of the England and Scotland of the time. It is also interesting to note the role of the two hitmen characters they are shadowy background figures in the '39 version but here they are more fully flushed out and well played by Duncan Lamont and Michael Goodlife. In the '78 version and the unofficial remake called North By Northwest the role of the hitmen is further developed and the suspense increased as a result.Other things to watch out for in the '59 version are Sidney James Brian Oulton and a host of supporting players not to mention Tania Elg's legs in the remake of the stockingremoving scene all the more intriguing for being in colour. Long available on VHS in the UK this film now sadly seems to be deleted and is much missed.".

There are one or two I don't think so scenes such as Perce's Sid James attitude to a wanted killer. But we'll let that pass. You have to look at the production in its own right because as a movie version of the book it just doesn't make it. The Hitchcock version was much better in that respect.

	schema:reviewBody "It's quite possible to enjoy this 39 Steps but it helps to see it fresh without any recent memory of the 1935 Hitchcock version. That one is a classic of suspense charm testy romance and surprises abetted by two fine performances from Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll. This 1959 Kenneth More vehicle maintains moreorless the same plot line and contains some very good piece parts. While it doesn't add up to being in the same league with its elder sibling it's good enough for a pleasant hourandahalf entertainment. When a nanny Richard Hannay More had met accidentally earlier in the day is murdered in his rooms after telling him there is an international plot involving ballistic missiles he realizes he will be blamed by the police. So after looking through the dead woman's purse and discovering a map where Glenkirk in Scotland is circled off he goes to see if he can discover the man behind the plot...a man with part of a finger missing. What Hannay encounters along the way is a suspicious school teacher Miss Fisher Taina Elg who turns him in on the train going to Scotland a fortune teller an all too knowledgeable professor two killers a clever escape while handcuffed to Fisher and finally the secret only Mr. Memory a music hall performer can unlock. The movie has several good elements especially the charm and confidence of Kenneth More as Hannay some wonderful Scottish scenery the movie is in color great train rides and one exciting train escape a ripely eccentric performance by Brenda de Banzie as a fortunetelling realist who helps Hannay a menacingly friendly appearance by Barry Jones a funny performance by Joan Hickson as a twittering school teacher that reminded me of a middle aged Miss Marple on amphetamines and an all too brief performance by Faith Brook as the nanny. For nostalgia buffs the movie opens with the great J. Arthur Rank gong doing its reverberating thing. Sadly there is little chemistry between More and Elg. She most often only looks irritated. The spirit of the movie aims for lighthearted charm mixed with thrills something More was very good at. To make the movie work however director Ralph Thomas and his editor needed to bring more energy to many of the thrills. Often the music score is used to set the tone which is not always matched by the pace of the movie. To give Thomas credit he was capable of delivering some menacing thrills as well as some fine broad comedy. If you can track them down The Clouded Yellow 1951 for romantic thrills and menace and Doctor in the House 1954 and Doctor at Sea 1955 for comedy are well worth viewing. If you like Kenneth More and don't mind a relatively undemanding but pleasant adventure you might enjoy this movie. I did. If you are one of those movie goers who fixate on how awful remakes of classics are and indignantly make comparisons this one will probably give you conniptions.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't remember much of the original film version of THE 39 STEPS but seeing this remake a couple of days ago I got the distinct feeling that it's rather inferior to the Hitchcock version . Much of the problem lies with the director Ralph Thomas who has a long and successful track record of making comedies and he seems unsuited for thrillers  everything seems a little too lightweight here and it's not helped by the cheery and jovial musical score or indeed Sid James playing a straight role as a lorry driver . It should also be pointed out that while Kenneth More plays an affable type of hero in Richard Hannay he lacks the dashing charm of Robert Donat in the original and is probably less effective than the slightly angry young man of Robert Powell in the latter 70s remake . More's Richard Hannay would probably have appeared too much of an old fashioned hero in 1959 to be taken entirely serious . He's by no means bad but remember DR NO was just around the corner and that movie turned the world upside down as to what made a cinematic hero . That's the problem  everything is too old fashioned from the polite tea parties to actresses in their late 20searly 30s playing schoolgirls There is another problem and that's the screenplay sticks to closely to the tone of the original . I dispute what it says in the IMDb trivia section about this movie being a shot for shot remake of the original Hitchcock version but it totally lacks an updated feel . War clouds were approaching when THE 39 STEPS was made in 1935 while the 1970s version used the approaching great war as its backdrop but does THE THIRTY NINE STEPS of 1959 feel like the West is engaged on a cold war crusade against communism ? There seems to be little sense of a political time and place with the bad guys coming across more of a criminal gang than traitors to the country . Unless I'm mistaken I don't think the word  Communism  features onceA very disappointing remake . I recommend the original or the 1978 version".

More's loyalty to the uninspired producerdirector team of Box and Thomas did him no favours either. Stodginess suffuses The 39 Steps it seems all too fitting that this must be one of the last action pictures whose hero wears a business suit and tie throughout.As a modernised colour remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic it makes the Highland scenery look good. And it follows the original a cheerful travesty of Buchan's yarn pretty closely save for a few pointless changes such as making the hunted hero lecture giggling girls instead of a political gathering. Yet it is lifeless compared with More's previous and subsequent movies A Night to Remember and North West Frontier.It's not Kenny's fault he is Donat's equal in resourcefulness and blitheness. One flaw is games mistress and love interest Taina Elg one of several drippy Continental misses imported to exoticise British films in those faraway days cf Maria Schell Anouk Aimee Odile Versois. Ms Elg's mousy Finnish looks and manner cannot begin to compare with Hitch's haughty but seducible blonde Madeleine Carroll the stockingchanging scene for instance packs no heat. But the big problem is Thomas's pedestrian handling. Toning down the erotic charge is only one way in which he garbles his tale. The constant flashes of imagination and twists which Hitch extracted from genre material such as the glimpse of the crofter and his young wife through the window after Hannay leaves or the chorus line's legs kicking heedlessly behind the pitiable Mr Memory have all vanished like a masterpainter's brushwork obscured by clumsy retouching.That poignant final scene in the music hall could serve as a filmschool case study in the gap between genius and mediocrity. Thomas hustles us through it. Mr Memory has no time to display his skills nor has Hannay time to work out the mystery before the assassin strikes. Hitch's backstage showmustgoon flurry is omitted Thomas reproduces the famous handsandhandcuffs shot then tries to cap the scene with a silly epilogue showing More in a flat cap with a walking stick strolling arm in arm with Elg by the river. A banal happy ending to a listless entertainment. Only Van Sant's misbegotten remake of Psycho served the Master's memory worse.".

	schema:headline " Trying to improve on Hitchcock's version was a vain endeavour";
	schema:reviewBody "Since Alfred Hitchcock's wellknown version from 1935 there have been two further adaptations of John Buchan's The 39 Steps. The 1978 version with Robert Powell kept the preWorld War I setting and was much more faithful to Buchan's plot than Hitchcock had been. The 1959 version however was a remake of Hitchcock's film keeping much of the plot and even some of the dialogue of his version. It came out in the same year as North by Northwest which can be seen as Hitchcock's own unacknowledged remake of his own film.Just as Hitchcock updated the story to the thirties so this one updates it to the fifties. Modern audiences tend to assume that the villains in the Hitchcock film are agents of Nazi Germany although this is never made explicit and for thirties audiences Stalin's Russia might have suggested itself as an alternative possibility. In the 1959 film made during the Cold War there is little doubt that the villains are working for the Soviet Union although again this is never explicitly stated.In this version the hero Richard Hannay is not a Canadian as he was in Hitchcock's film but an Englishman recently returned from working in the Middle East. In Buchan's novel he was a Scot who had worked in South Africa. He meets by chance a woman who reveals to him that she is a spy working for British Intelligence and has uncovered a plot by a mysterious organisation known as The Thirty Nine Steps to steal the topsecret plans for a new British ballistic missile. In Hitchcock's version the secret information related to a new aircraft engine. She tells Hannay that she must leave for Scotland immediately but while he is out of the room she is killed by two hit men. Fearing he will be accused of her murder he decides to continue her mission and catches a train to Scotland. The plot continues along much the same lines as Hitchcock's although there are a few changes. The heroine whom Hannay meets on the train is for example a sports teacher at a girls' public school. There are also some added scenes such as the one where Hannay stays at an inn whose landlady turns out to be a spiritualist medium.Hitchcock's film was a comedythriller which combined suspense with humour and the remake was intended in the same vein. Ralph Thomas was known as a director of both comedies such as the Doctor films and thrillers such as The Clouded Yellow so he doubtless seemed the right man for the job. Compared to the original however this film is a pedestrian affair. To be fair to Thomas part of the blame lies with the actors. Kenneth More plays Hannay as the sort of decent middleclass stiffupperlipped English gentleman which had become his stockintrade a characterisation which seems stolid and uninteresting next to the panache of Robert Donat's dashing action hero. The casting of the Finnish actress Taina Elg as Miss Fisher was an unsuccessful attempt to inject some Continental glamour into the film. Elg always comes across as dull and unglamorous especially when compared to Madeleine Carroll who played the equivalent role in the Hitchcock film and her foreign accent makes it difficult to accept her as a British schoolmistress.Some of the blame for the film's comparative failure however must lie with the director and scriptwriters. Some of the scenes such as Hannay's escape on the Forth railway bridge are indeed better done here than they were in the original which is perhaps not surprising given that Thomas evidently had more financial resources available to him than did Hitchcock. The film as a whole however lacks the sense of movement and excitement which characterised Hitchcock's. The attempts at humour generally fall flat. The scene with the milkman is mishandled in the original the humour arises from the fact that the milkman refuses to believe the truth but readily believes Hannay's false story about being a lover escaping from a jealous husband. In the remake Hannay simply comes out with the invented story without any attempt to tell the true one. The other comic high point of Hitchcock's film the scene at the political meeting here becomes an attempt to give a lecture to the assembled schoolgirls and loses much of its point.This is not a particularly bad film and is certainly not the worst Hitchcock remake. That dubious distinction must belong to Gus van Sant's horrible version of Psycho. Nevertheless the filmmakers seem to have failed to realise that trying to improve on Hitchcock's version was a vain endeavour. Had they wanted to make a new version of The 39 Steps they should have gone back to Buchan as the makers of the 1978 film did. 510".

Kenneth More who seemed to appear in every British film I watched in the 1950s is excellent as Richard Hannay. What I like about this film is the interlacing of humour as well as the sinister threatening of the enemy. The fact that we are never really told who the enemy is adds to the tension and the mystery but the real strength lies in the humour  the impersonation of the whistling milk man the handcuffing together of Hannay and Fisher and the way that the landlady identifies with the runaway couple reminding McDougal of their own courting days. The climax in the theatre is a little unbelievable with the audience watching dancing girls minutes after the Memory Man has been shot for example and we are not told how Hannay and Fisher managed to get from Perthshire to London with every policeman in Great Britain after them! The authentic Scottish scenery especially Waverley Station and the Forth Bridge adds to the film. I first saw this film in about 1960 I have seen it about a dozen times since and I keep enjoying it!".

	schema:reviewBody "The 39 Steps starts in Regent's Park in London where Richard Hannay Kenneth More witnesses a woman Faith Brooke with a pram knocked own by a speeding car he rushes to the aid of the baby in the pram but only finds a gun inside which he keeps. Later that afternoon Hannay manages to meet up with the mysterious woman at a performance of Mr. Memory James Hayter at the Palace theatre they start talking  the woman says she is a secret agent trying to stop the leaking of top secret Government information. Back at Hanny's flat the woman is murdered  Hannay know's the police will suspect him so he takes the gun  the few pieces of information that he managed to learn from the woman  head towards Scotland where she was due to meet her contact  expose the head of the enemy organisation who want to smuggle top secret plans for the 'Boomerang' defense system out of the country. Wanted for murder Hannay finds himself caught up in a plot that could threaten Britain  those who live there...This British production was directed by Ralph Thomas was a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's earlier The 39 Steps 1935 which itself was based on the novel of the same name by John Buchan while yet another big screen version was made as The Thirty Nine Steps 1978 a couple of decades after this while I liked The 39 Steps for most of it's duration as a fairly gentle  light hearted action adventure I simply didn't understand the end. Now I don't know if I missed something but I couldn't make sense of anything what the bad guy's plans actually were or how it was all supposed to work. How did Mr. Memory get all the codes  formula's? Was he in on it? How was the guy with a finger missing going to extract the information he needed? Why not just kidnap Mr. Memory  get the information he wanted sooner? How did Hannay know what to ask Mr. Memory at the end? Was Mr. Memory in on it? If he was why didn't he just tell the guy the secret codes? If he wasn't how did Mr. Memory know those top secret things? It all seemed rather random  rushed the ending should have been explained better  I am sorry if it's just me being stupid it wouldn't be the first time but I honestly didn't understand what was meant to be going on what the bad guy's plan was  how it was all meant to pan out. If the bad guy's had planted the information in Mr. Memories head then why not just photograph it? Why not say it out loud  record it to tape? Why such a complicated  frankly silly plot? Until the last bewildering five minutes or so The 39 Steps had a been a perfectly likable adventure film that moved along at a decent pace had a few amusing situations as Hannay met an odd assortment of people on his travels  even had some decent action too but that baffling ending ruined it all for me. Again if it's just me being thick then I apologise but can someone explain what the bad guy's plan was meant to be? If it had worked properly how was it all meant to go down?The 39 Steps looks nice enough the colourful London  Scottish locations add to the film although maybe the special effects aren't the best the shot of Hannay hanging on to the side of a speeding looks poor. Director Thomas keeps things moving at a good pace there are some workmanlike scenes like the part when Fisher overhears the two spies expose their whole plan over a public telephone. Despite the title we never actually see the 39 steps that it refers to apart from when the opening credits play over a still of them. I have never seen Hitchcock's original or read the novel so I cannot compare how this stands up to them.Filmed on location in Scotland  in the studio back in London this is well made for the time although obviously it does look a bit dated today. It's interesting to see the leading man here or the hero if you like as a middle aged rather ordinary looking man rather than a super fit toned muscle bound twenty something that typifies the average action hero today. Legendary comedy actor Sid James has a great little cameo as a truck driver.The 39 Steps is a perfectly good adventure mystery film until the end where it all falls apart none of it made any sort of sense to me. Maybe I am just being stupid but I couldn't work any reasonable explanation out. I remember really liking the 1978 version with Robert Powell but haven't seen it since the 90's so I think I will watch that again soon.".

Later that afternoon Hannay manages to meet up with the mysterious woman at a performance of Mr. Memory James Hayter at the Palace theatre they start talking  the woman says she is a secret agent trying to stop the leaking of top secret Government information. Back at Hanny's flat the woman is murdered  Hannay know's the police will suspect him so he takes the gun  the few pieces of information that he managed to learn from the woman  head towards Scotland where she was due to meet her contact  expose the head of the enemy organisation who want to smuggle top secret plans for the 'Boomerang' defense system out of the country. Wanted for murder Hannay finds himself caught up in a plot that could threaten Britain  those who live there...This British production was directed by Ralph Thomas was a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's earlier The 39 Steps 1935 which itself was based on the novel of the same name by John Buchan while yet another big screen version was made as The Thirty Nine Steps 1978 a couple of decades after this while I liked The 39 Steps for most of it's duration as a fairly gentle  light hearted action adventure I simply didn't understand the end. Now I don't know if I missed something but I couldn't make sense of anything what the bad guy's plans actually were or how it was all supposed to work. How did Mr. Memory get all the codes  formula's? Was he in on it? How was the guy with a finger missing going to extract the information he needed? Why not just kidnap Mr. Memory  get the information he wanted sooner? How did Hannay know what to ask Mr. Memory at the end? Was Mr. Memory in on it? If he was why didn't he just tell the guy the secret codes? If he wasn't how did Mr. Memory know those top secret things? It all seemed rather random  rushed the ending should have been explained better  I am sorry if it's just me being stupid it wouldn't be the first time but I honestly didn't understand what was meant to be going on what the bad guy's plan was  how it was all meant to pan out. If the bad guy's had planted the information in Mr. Memories head then why not just photograph it? Why not say it out loud  record it to tape? Why such a complicated  frankly silly plot? Until the last bewildering five minutes or so The 39 Steps had a been a perfectly likable adventure film that moved along at a decent pace had a few amusing situations as Hannay met an odd assortment of people on his travels  even had some decent action too but that baffling ending ruined it all for me. Again if it's just me being thick then I apologise but can someone explain what the bad guy's plan was meant to be? If it had worked properly how was it all meant to go down?The 39 Steps looks nice enough the colourful London  Scottish locations add to the film although maybe the special effects aren't the best the shot of Hannay hanging on to the side of a speeding looks poor. Director Thomas keeps things moving at a good pace there are some workmanlike scenes like the part when Fisher overhears the two spies expose their whole plan over a public telephone. Despite the title we never actually see the 39 steps that it refers to apart from when the opening credits play over a still of them. I have never seen Hitchcock's original or read the novel so I cannot compare how this stands up to them.Filmed on location in Scotland  in the studio back in London this is well made for the time although obviously it does look a bit dated today. It's interesting to see the leading man here or the hero if you like as a middle aged rather ordinary looking man rather than a super fit toned muscle bound twenty something that typifies the average action hero today. Legendary comedy actor Sid James has a great little cameo as a truck driver.The 39 Steps is a perfectly good adventure mystery film until the end where it all falls apart none of it made any sort of sense to me. Maybe I am just being stupid but I couldn't work any reasonable explanation out. I remember really liking the 1978 version with Robert Powell but haven't seen it since the 90's so I think I will watch that again soon.";

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Hannay is in the park when he sees a nanny he was just talking to hit by a hit and run driver.  He runs to her pram and finds only a gun. After she gets better he finds her again and she confides in him that her work is of national importance.  While he is in another room she is murdered in his home.  Hannay goes on the run from the police using the snippets of information she gave him to look for her contact.  However he falls into danger and must race to uncover a spy ring before they can leave the country with sensitive information.Rather than being an attempt to reinterpret the book for the screen this is a reinterpretation of the original film.  This means that it is essentially the original film with some changes to locations and characters.  Sadly this is the film's failing  that it never manages to step out of the shadow of the original.  The changes are slight changes in plot focus and the change in the nature of some of the characters and none of them really work very well.  The humour is poor and the chemistry between Hannay and Fisher is nonexistent.  Other characters like the Scottish spiritualist are just out of place.Worse than this is the fact that the film lacks real tension or excitement. Part of this lies with Kenneth More who acts like he's out for a stroll. No part of his performance really makes you believe that he is in danger at any point  he never gets close to desperation.  However the film itself is very flat and wandering.  It lacks Hitchcock's tautness and it suffers even without the comparison.  The Scottish scenery is overused.  It looks great and is full of lush colours but this does two things that contribute to the weakness in the film.  First the lush colours give the impression of calm and beauty whereas what was needed was more urgency.  Secondly it does give the feel of a travelogue type film rather than a drama.The rest of the cast are relatively impressionless.  Elg is poorly cast and doesn't fit in.  Jones is pretty much without menace only a cameo by Sid James caught my eye  but that was only because of his presence and not his contribution.Overall this is a poor remake of the original film.  The 1970's remake is much better than this as it doesn't just ape the Hitchcock version.  This manages to retread a lot of old ground but make it less palatable  a flat lifeless version that really lacks any excitement or tension.".

	schema:reviewBody "A zippy and enjoyable version of John Buchan's novel far lighter in tone that Hitchcock's. The versions differ in more than tone. In Hitchcock's film Hannay undergoes different sorts of divagations and dangers than he does here in Ralph Thomas's film. There's nothing wrong with that. Neither film is a close adaptation of Buchan's book. If I remember Hanny has a heck of a long time getting from place to place in the novel at one point having to take a job as a ditch digger.The color in the more recent film is easier on the eyes but adds a cheery note to the proceedings too absent 1935's stark shadows. And there has been a good deal of location shooting in London and Scotland so the onelane gravel highland roads are no longer clogged with sheep and cloaked with fog no longer so claustrophobic. Nor is Kenneth More what we usually think of as a brutishly dramatic actor. Like the earlier Robert Donat he seems like a rather likable guy and there isn't a moment when we feel he's in fear for his life. Taina Elg has a plainvanilla pretty face suggestive of a highschool prom queen. This isn't an especially good thing let's face facts. But her plumplipped youthfulness the hint of a Khalka Mongol in her Finnish eyes and the fact that we know she is a ballerina adds a certain frisson of the exotic. What normal man wouldn't want to have a struggle with her in the back seat as Kenneth More does? Thomas's film is not nearly as stark as Hitchcock's. It's almost sumptuous. Instead of that depressing encounter with the pecuniary Scottish farmer and his deprived wife there is an abundance of Brenda de Banzie who with the consent of her meek husband offers Moore much more than a box bed and a meal of the herring. And there is nothing like the scene between Anne Robinson and Robert Donat in Donat's firstfloor flat when she asks for something to eat and Donat prepares a huge slab of haddock in a frying pan. No veggies no wine no nothing. As he stands over the stove Donat wears a heavy overcoat with its vast collar turned up around his ears a cigarette in his mouth the ashes perhaps filtering down into the frying fish. The place looks sterile discomfiting and cold as hell. More's flat on the other hand is colorfully decorated with alien objects from his travels around the world. The episode on the Forth Bridge is almost a duplicate of the original.In one scene though Thomas and his writers outdo Hitchcock and his. More like Donat accidentally stumbles onto a stage and is forced to improvise a speech. In the original it involved some palaver about local politics. Here it is a lecture on Woods and Wayside in a girls' school with the emphasis on a plant called the spleenwort. More stumbles a bit at first chuckling over his own ineptitude then tells a joke about a Scotsman an Englishman and an Irishman. We only get to hear the punch line that suggests the story was slightly off color. The girls must have loved it because they're all giggling. Then More really gets into his pitch. He once had a parrot he claims that was allergic to spleenwort. You had only to open a spleenwort in front of him for him to show his disgust. And I think we can all agree that there is nothing less pleasant than a disgusted parrot. As he's dragged from the lectern More shouts out a summary of his lecture  Please girls don't fall by the wayside. And above all stay out of the woods! I smiled at Donat's impromptu speech but I laughed out loud through More's.As I say it's not nearly as dark as Hitchcock's vision. This is strictly a comedy with thriller undertones rather than the other way around. You'll probably enjoy it.".

	schema:headline " Good thriller over shadowed by Hitchcock's film which it remakes";
	schema:reviewBody "Kenneth More is Richard Hanny in what is essentially a bright and colorful version of the Hitchcock film. Its the second screen version followed by the more faithful to source version from the late 1970's and a BBC TV version from a few years ago. Its the classic story of the wrong man on the run having to unravel the mystery that officials are too blind to see. Its a good little film on its own but suffers in comparison to the other versions. There are two problems with the film first the bright daylight and colors work against the mood. the other problem is Kenneth Moore is too stalwart a hero to be anything other than a man of action. he carries himself with such aplomb that its hard to believe that he could ever not come out on top.. Other versions aside its a good little film that is fine in its own terms. For me having recently seen the Hitchcock film a couple of times not to mention the stage adaption I found myself all stepped out. Worth a look if you can manage to see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "As far as remakes go this is not a bad one. It is infinitely better than the dreadful remake to Psycho which quite frankly was pointless and was inferior in every possible way to the chilling and traumatising original. I will say right now I do prefer the Hitchcock film which was really entertaining suspenseful well made and had believable chemistry between Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll despite the deviations from the book. Plus it was Hitchcock who directs while putting a lot of his fashioned touches that instantly made his directorial style recognisable.This remake has its flaws but there are worse remakes out there ie.Psycho Wicker Man. The pacing here is a tad sluggish there are one or two drawn out scenes that drag a bit. Also Taina Elg looks rather uncomfortable here no denying she is a lovely lady but her chemistry with Kenneth More isn't always there. Plus I also felt the direction from Ralph Thomas was on the pedestrian side. I also felt the scripting on occasions lacked the wit and suspense that made the Hitchcock film so memorable.Flaws aside the plot is still good and intriguing enough and so is the music which is quite stirring and the stylish camera work. Kenneth More while he has acted better is still very likable in the lead role of Richard Hannay and the location shots of London are excellent plus the Scottish scenery is stunning. The lighting is okay could've been brighter in places but it was not distractingly bad or anything. Overall this is a decent remake but as I have accentuated many times the Hitchcock film will always be better no matter how much it is removed from the source material. 710 Bethany Cox".

However the sequels and his other subsequent film's are either roundly ignored or highly frowned upon. That's a shame because Almost An Angel is a very engaging comedy the sort of picture that stands up like a Capraesque piece for the 90s.

True enough the doses of sentiment are at times like a treacle itch to be scratched but is that a bad thing? Watching a street wise criminal turning his less than honourable skills into a thing of goodness?The film has many visual gags to go with the ream of religious ones that flow within the piece be it Hogan attempting to fly or a quiet word about Elvis Almost An Angel delights if one accepts the nature of the beast. Linda Kozlowski again teams up with Hogan after the earlier Crocodile Dundee pairing here she has very little to do but she slots in very nicely even if a preend credits sequence does her and everyone else no favours at all. The best actor on show is the criminally undervalued Elias Koteas playing the wheelchair bound Steve Garner he exudes a believability factor that many modern day actors can learn from where the ability to act with just your face is high art if it's done correctly. Check out both the first and last scenes that Koteas shares with Hogan great stuff that seems to have been forgotten due to the disdain shown for this particular film.I rate it 710 because it hits my spot when I need a pick me up perhaps that is too high in this age where comedy is the hardest genre to succeed in? But don't believe the low rating here on this site it's a delightful little comedy that is far from perfect but hell!

The numero uno of these is the way Hogan's character Terry interacts with the handicap Steve.  The lines in the bar are excellent to explaining how one should treat someone with a handicap.  But they just don't stop there they continue to show this throughout the rest of the movie.  The scenes with Terry  Steve are priceless at times.  But this movie has a good deal of tongue in cheek humor as well.  Taking a convict and making him an angel of mercy was quite hilarious like when he robs the fast food restaraunt to feed the poor and especially the scene where he talks with Charlton Heston as God.  And of course the very convincing impersonations of Willie Nelson and Rod Stewart are classic.  I especially love the scene where the police are interviewing the bank tellers after the robbery.  The movie cleverly uses plays on words like born again Christian and periodically makes fun of itself all of which work.  The ending was both surprising and touching especially since the whole movie you aren't sure if Terry had a dream or whether he really was sent back. All in all I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  It's too bad the world didn't feel the same way about this movie.".

I had to get my copy from ebay because they have stopped producing it. As somebody else says 'come on do it on DVD'. And after you have seen it I think you will agree it is worthy of a sequel.";

It is sensitive and touching without being over sentimental or condescending.This shows a hidden quality in Hogan's writing that Hollywood missed in his postCrocodile Dundee movies and is also in evidence in Lightning Jack and the part of Cuba Gooding Jnr. This movie may not have the charm of Dundee but the comedy is there and it is certainly more thought provoking about our attitudes to the disabled.A very good movie.".

This particular movie was funny as well as heartwarming. When he picked the fight with the guy in the wheel chair I thought I would bust a gut. But he was just trying to prove a point. When he was shot with the gun loaded with blanks you start to worry will he do something stupid and end up dead or is he really an angel. My all time Hogan favorite.

Charlton Heston makes an excellent Godfigure and probation is a term that Terry understands.So believing that he's an angel on probation Terry is sent back to make a difference... and has to work out what sort of things The Boss approves of... Robbery? Maybe not. But what about robbery to feed the poor and hungry?We follow Terry as he learns  at times hilariously at times deeply touchingly  to fulfil the terms of his probation... This is a tale about redemption  not merely Terry's but those people with whom he becomes involved. It's a story about death but most importantly about life. It's the story about a man's relationship with the Boss and what faith is about. The film contains action comedy cops and robbers tragedy and victory... No it probably doesn't rank as One Of Ye Greatest Films In History. But it is a funny touching heartwarming beautiful film and I only wish that it were available somewhere on DVD. For personal preference... I score it a 10 out 10. And am keeping my fingers crossed that SOMEONE will decide to release it on DVD! Please pretty please!?".

Even Charlton Heston gets in on the act in a dream sequence that finds Hoges in Heaven after performing a brave act. Ex con and master thief Terry Dean Hogan who has a near death experience when thinking real bullets went through him and didn't kill him making him change his ways and become devout truly thinking he's an angel. They were blanks fired from the gun of a thug whose part of a group of robbers who do over this bank Hoges was gonna hold up while dressed in Rod Stewart garb. It's not the first time Hoges has made fun of this music icon too while he takes pokes at Willie Nelson also. He crosses paths with an angry young cripple a younger Elias Koteas a wild actor whose become one of my favourite stars. His sister is played by Linda Kozlowski these two latter stars proving they're more the real actors of the show while Hoges just lazes back playing himself not like Crocodile Dundee which showed off his real acting. Actually Kozlowski's pretty good in this I thought one actress who should of done more movies. There's a lot of underlying messages too in this movie Like if you do good in this world good is what you'll get back. Actor or not Hoges is what makes the film funny as if he's put in some of his own script input which leads you to wonder while John Cornell has again surprised us and in another way brought it to the table but not as good enough match for the croc. For Hoges fans that will bring a bit of scattered disappointment to some of that minority and a larger one for others I imagine.".

Hogan's financial success with the first two Crocodile Dundee films in the late1980s led to this sappy little sleeping pill. Hogan who wrote the screenplay basically does the same routine he did in the series that made him famous. The subject matter and the black comedy here feels forced and uninspired.

Only this criminal has changed his ways after a near death situation and he now believes he's an angel on a mission from God but is he?Thing about this film that is disappointing is the fact they don't really make the most of the idea. We're never entirely sure if Hogan's character is actually an angel was his afterlife experience just a dream or not and if he's really invincible we're led to believe he's a heavenly being through various lucky scrapes. For the whole run time this concept isn't really explored as well as it could have been I think because this character doesn't really do much accept walk out in front of trucks. There are times he puts himself at risk helping others like standing up against some gang members and setting up religious themed tricks but on the whole its all dialog.Now there's nothing wrong with good dialog emotional dialog...but this doesn't really have that Paul Hogan comedy remember you really do expect there to be more in the shape of visual comedy. Most of the time he's chatting to folk trying to either con or assist them and of course having to fend off his real time wife Kozlowski. Gee I wonder whose idea it was to cast her in the film. I suppose it is neat to have us the audience unsure as to whether this guy is really an angel or not but this also kinda leads to the movie being really very dull. Like I say nothing really happens that is exciting or remotely interesting other than him beating some guys up once and walking out in front of a truck.Things become really boring when he meets up with a wheelchair bound Elias Koteas whom he makes friends with. This is the main plot point in the film and its incredibly boring things were dull before this but dear Lord it gets worse. The movies highlight appears to be a chase sequence between a fat cop and Koteas in his wheelchair...and the fat cop can't catch him...on foot...riiiiiight. They actually do try and make this sequence really intense as Koteas ducks under stuff turns corners sharply and pumps away to increase his speed...I'm serious here. Plus I really gotta mention how lame of an ending it is for Koteas' character he bumps into something and ends up fatally stabbing himself in the thigh...laugh out loud!In the end we actually discover Hogan is an angel...oh spoil...whatever. Its only then that you realise how cool this film could of been with more ghosty spiritual moments like that. Don't get me wrong its a nice ending but it sure took some strength to get there sheesh! The tagline for this movie is 'The guy from down under is working for the man upstairs'...I mean sure its a quirky line but are they really still banking on the fact Hogan is an Aussie?? still pushing and depending on that unimportant geographical detail! Surely they exhausted that with the 'Mick Dundee' movies...we get it he's an Aussie cultural differences gag officially milked.310".

The rest of the film was pretty amazing too. But not amazing in a good way. I just couldn't believe how bad it was. I am actually still amazed as hell. The story is so crappy that I think I could write a thousand stories which are better. Here is a series of 'highlights'. It all starts in the Middle Ages where some weapon maker is being punished for selling weapons to both sides. This has almost nothing to do with the film except that the weapon maker is an ancestor of a really bad guy in the movie. Then there is a transport of very high tech rockets which are almost stolen by some guys with really high tech weapons but some other guys with high tech weapons come to the rescue. indeed every weapon in the movie is high tech like year 3009 high tech. The rescue guys appear to be a special forces team called G.I. Joe. The surviving guys from the transport really like to join the team but they need to be trained first. At the end of the first day of training they are almost scoring highest in the history of the team so they are done. Right. Then the bad guys come in and steal the rockets. This time they succeed so the G.I. Joes need to get them back. This results in some really good action scenes including the Eiffel Tower coming down. It all looks really realistic. But after this it's only down the hill. The bad guys seem to have built a base under the polar ice the size of a little city. Somehow no one ever noticed something happening there. Or everyone knew but just didn't inform G.I. Joe. By the way it actually wasn't really cold out there somehow because a lot of people didn't wear special clothes while walking around on the ice and it didn't seem to bother them at all. Or the actors just didn't know how to act like it was cold. That is possible because none of the actors was really looking like heshe cared a lot. Marlon Wayans was probably the least bad while he wasn't even funny. I think that says enough. The polar base is destroyed after a fight won by the good guys and because of the explosions the polar ice sinks together with the base. Yes dear readers the ice sinks. So alls well that ends well. oh first one of the good guys needs to take down some rockets the bad guys managed to shoot just before the base was destroyed. Somehow the rockets can only be taken out by a supersonic plane that can only be controlled by speaking Celtic which one of members of G.I.Joe happens to speak. So actually it's not really a problem I think. Maybe it is a problem I don't know but it just doesn't make sense. Nothing in the whole script makes any sense. I still don't believe it. I'm sorry guys it's overwhelming me. I need to stop writing or I'll start crying or worse. Just remember don't watch the movie!".

At the end of the first day of training they are almost scoring highest in the history of the team so they are done. Right. Then the bad guys come in and steal the rockets. This time they succeed so the G.I. Joes need to get them back. This results in some really good action scenes including the Eiffel Tower coming down. It all looks really realistic. But after this it's only down the hill. The bad guys seem to have built a base under the polar ice the size of a little city. Somehow no one ever noticed something happening there. Or everyone knew but just didn't inform G.I. Joe. By the way it actually wasn't really cold out there somehow because a lot of people didn't wear special clothes while walking around on the ice and it didn't seem to bother them at all. Or the actors just didn't know how to act like it was cold. That is possible because none of the actors was really looking like heshe cared a lot. Marlon Wayans was probably the least bad while he wasn't even funny. I think that says enough. The polar base is destroyed after a fight won by the good guys and because of the explosions the polar ice sinks together with the base. Yes dear readers the ice sinks. So alls well that ends well. oh first one of the good guys needs to take down some rockets the bad guys managed to shoot just before the base was destroyed. Somehow the rockets can only be taken out by a supersonic plane that can only be controlled by speaking Celtic which one of members of G.I.Joe happens to speak. So actually it's not really a problem I think. Maybe it is a problem I don't know but it just doesn't make sense. Nothing in the whole script makes any sense. I still don't believe it. I'm sorry guys it's overwhelming me. I need to stop writing or I'll start crying or worse. Just remember don't watch the movie!";

The martial arts choreography is good and stunning in one scene. The practical effects are believable but the computer graphics are mostly cartoonish and detract from the visual impact of the film so its hard to say go see it even if your standard for a good movie is if they blow stuff up in new and interesting ways.I did enjoy the sheer audacity of its failure. Surely the filmmakers had watched even one movie before and knew they had a piece of Star WarsJames Bond ripoff fan fiction on their hands and just tried to be as bad as possible. This movie has a lot of laughs in it although probably not where the filmmakers intended.".

It is a contender for the coveted title of the worst movie of the year. This movie was awful. I have pooped out better movies than this. The actingcrap. The castingterrible who cast Marlon Wayans in a serious part? Character Developmentabsent Fight scenesoverdone and absurd Special effectsdecent but not good enough to distract me from all the suck around it. The only cool part was when they were chasing the car in Paris but I have a hard time believing that one of the guys could catch up with the other after falling back like half a mile but neither of them could gain thirty feet to catch the car they were chasing. This movie was sooooooooo cheesy and predictable. Who would have thought that duke and Anna would end up together? Who would have thought that snake eyes would killed his brother in the final showdown and still keep his vow of silence? Who would have thought that Marlon wayans would have ended up with the redhead? And what the  is up with cobra commander? He's just darth vader with a monocle. And why in gods green earth would they show you cobra commander's face?!? That's unacceptable. Shame on the writers shame on the directors shame on the actors producers and editors for making such a disgraceful movie as this. Do yourself a favor and burn your ten dollars.

As far as I am concerned the toys and the cartoons from that era are the best. However after first seeing the preview for GI Joe and seeing that they now wore mech suits...... I had very low expectations for the movie. Just figured they were trying yet another way to milk money off of the remainder of 80's cartoons reimaging.However I have to say even though there was a little cheesiness to it I really enjoyed this movie. This movie is based off a toycartooncomic book. It isn't like other comics that could be deep or thought provoking. It was always mainly about action cool weapons good guys and bad guys getting caught and then escaping. This movie is just that. A action movie from start to finish. Has enough of a storyline to make it from beginning to end but is mainly about the action. It doesn't give you a lot of back story to the characters. You do get a couple flashbacks just so you know who people are and how they are connected. But this isn't really an origins movie. I think some people were expecting some kind of epic movie experience. This movie is not that! This is a popcorn summer action movie and a way to relive some childhood memories for those of us who grew up watching the cartoon or playing with the toys.For those of you complaining about plot holes andor unbelievable science......... come on!!! What about the original cartoons was so believable??? This is fantasy!!!I will admit though although I did like the movie some of the special effects were not that good. There were a few times during the movie where I saw something that just looked too fake and I was like ... that is just cheesy. But overall it was a fun movie.

It's never boring and it's the silly fun it was always going to be.So in a nutshell.. if you want a serious film to watch check out There Will Be Blood or Doubt but if you just want to forget for two hours the mess your leaders have left your nation nay the world and just have fun check out this action film.

From the trailers alone I could tell this movie was engineered for the mindless drones that make up the majority of summer blockbuster audiences. I imagine the only people will actually enjoy this film are the types of zombie slugs that clap and yell BIG BOOM! SEXY LADIES! when they see this. This movie request little if any thinking at all to enjoy. I got far far less out of going to see this than the faintest glimmer of hope that this would be even halfway decent let alone watchable. It is seriously hard to describe with words how terrible this movie is. I am not in any way a fan boy or a fantasized G.I. Joe fan nor am I comparing this to the source material which I have seen some of. I am reviewing this movie solely for what it is A disgraceful atrocity against mankind.For starters the script was atrocious to say the least. It seemed like every other word is a G.I. Joe catch phrase or a cheese ball line. Delivered with subpar acting you can completely toss any hope for this aspect of the movie out the window and watch is collide on hard pavement 10 stories below.I know this time line is supposed to be independent from the G.I. Joe cartoon but the story was pitiful as well. I think the biggest killer for me was the flashbacks that occurred every five to ten minutes. I understand these are placed in for the moviegoer who has no knowledge of characters but they are all ridiculous and add absolutely nothing to the story. If they are going to do a sequel which is set up at the end they could have added in some of the character development then instead of cramming all of it in at once.The special effects weren't too bad and some of the fighting was choreographed well. Rachel Nichols and Sienna Miller leather suit were nice eye candy as well but those are the only good things I have to say about this movie.If you are a mindless unintelligent zombie that likes big explosions nonsensical stories andor sexy ladies strap on your bib because your mouth will most likely be agape in amazement from flashing colors and lights during the film and watch this. Then when you are done come back to IMDb and give it anything above a 2 or 3.If you are even a halfway intelligent person that can understand basic laws of physics and can appreciate even a decent summer blockbuster do not watch this movie. When I say do not watch this movie I mean do not even bother illegally downloading it or renting it. If a friend of yours has it and offers to watch it leave immediately. If you walk into their place while they are half way through it turn around and drive away quickly or better yet jump out the window.I saw this in a free theater and I felt so nauseous afterward I think they should have paid me to watch it. If only I had known just how terrible this was going to be before going in I would have saved myself the horror and agony of sitting through this and watched paint dry or stared directly at the sun which would have been more entertaining.For those of you who can successfully read through this review without being distracted by a flying insect do not under any circumstance watch this movie. If I could I would rate this movie as a Class A Poison. Keep it away from children and animals because even a small dose is potentially harmful. Yes that is right I would not let even my dog watch this as I would consider it animal cruelty. This is a fair warning to you all!To IMDb Please make the rating system 010 so I can give this movie a 0.Note I put the words film and movie in quotations when referring to G.I. Joe Rise of the Cobra. This is because I do not actually believe this to be a movie but instead an anthology of how stupid the human race has become in mass.".

But don't get your hopes up because if you're expecting an actual plot and a cleverhumorous dialogue banter between well developed characters. You'd have more luck watching half way through a Disney Pixar film.The film was all action and that's it. Script plot the art of acting  characterisation was all completely fked! Not that the screenwriters and director Stephen Sommers thought any of these film techniques would help make the movie a little more bearable. They seem determined to mainly deliver one highoctane heavily CGIladen ultimately deadening effect.The film revolves around the idea of the Joes not just the one allAmericanhero G.I Joe  now a massive underground secret service division with the best ops from all around the world cumulated into one unit. Right this is a seriously flawed foundation for the film to be base on since all I was asking throughout the film was where's the funding coming from? Didn't anyone notice all their best soldiers disappearing? Why the hell are all these solders cooperatively turning their back on their own countries to work for America? .... Weren't any of these questions raised at all??? The government must all be fken stupid in the near future. I mean I'm all for good bullshit light entertaining actions films but there's only so much I can handle. And throwing in a whole heap of 'the Mummy' cast Brendan Fraser Arnold Vosloo  Kevin J.

	schema:reviewBody "it was far far too long the only good part was in Paris when they wore the suits basically from the TV trailers an unusually silly film that I would honestly recommend anyone to wait until it appears on DVD or better to save your money and await T.V. in 3 years. I'm trying to put into words how bad this film was and it's difficult... . honestly... .

I personally liked both but where did they get the idea to make Cobra Commander and the Baroness brother and sister?? Oh yeah and Cobra Commander was Dukes buddy? and the Baroness was Duke's Fiance?? I have an idea let's remake the Wizard of Oz and have the wicked witch be the good guy and Dorothy be the evil villain... I think it will work as well as this movie... When I first see Snake Eyes I think yes this rocks... Little do I know they screw up every major development in the entire story line of either. It looks like they try to follow the comic book story line except Scarlett is Ripcord's love interest she is not with Snake Eyes... There is so much I could talk about how awful this movie is but I can't. I didn't care for the second Transformers Movie but if I had to go watch either one of these two films again it was a much better movie than this one. I warn all of you that have not seen this movie yet do not go if you love the TV show and the Comic Book. I don't want to see anyone else disappointed like I am.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to confess I'm not much of a G.I. Joe fan when I was a kid partly because the other Hasbro product in transforming robots had more appeal to a boy than a bunch of plastic figures in military garb. The cartoon series too didn't convert me either as it was up against a whole host of classic series from MASK to Silverhawks Centurion to Starcomm. Ahh the wonderful 80s to be growing up...So while I do not hold G.I Joe in as high a regard as Transformers between the two films this summer based on the Hasbro toys I will unabashedly proclaim that G.I. Joe triumphs over the other by a long mile. Michael Bay in his second robot outing has proved to be a twotrick pony relying on countless of larger than large explosions  hardly a frame passes by without being engulfed in an inferno  and of course Ms Fox's bouncing assets in slow motion. While one can afford to leave one's brains at the door for popcorn flicks such as these Bay had forgotten than they have to be basically fun to watch and magically he had dumbed Transformers down to a mindnumbing bore.Enter Stephen Sommers who had a couple of box office successes with the actionadventure genre in The Mummy movies so this guy obviously knows what he's doing and it shows. Forget the excuse of a story just to link up the big set action pieces and it is precisely in the action that Sommers understood when to show restraint add in a dash of humour pepper it with proper camera angles though of course still unable to buckle the trend of slowing things down just before any impact. Slow motion unfortunately is here to stay I guess.There are obviously some updates to this big budgeted flick that while it's still a military type based movie per se some common sensibilities have crept in. No more are the soldiers Real American heroes though that iconic phrase still managed a mention and a more inclusive but still token in a way United Nations type bestofthebest elite troopers get invited to this highly classified unit blessed with unlimited budget for high tech weapons and toys. Unlike Bay's invasionandconquer type of US troopers these guys do get arrested after they unleash their weapons of mass destruction diplomatic immunity not withstanding afterwards. And of course having futuristic toys help to lift this into fantasyland than an all out US Military commercial selling the virtues of why Uncle Sam needs you.Sommers also managed to blend in the myriad of characters from the beloved toy lines and series akin to what Bryan Singer managed to pull off with XMen but of course without the cerebral material to go along. Everything here is plain and simple with black being black and white being white. It doesn't get bogged down with trying to tell the origin stories of everyone but does so at precise intervals. I suspect if there was going to be more movies then the case dossiers of the Joes would get their respective air time.Otherwise like the subtitle mentioned it's more of a bad guys take all film where surprisingly the Joes always a step behind from the first action sequence until the last. It was smart too that the film had action over land sea and air covering a wide range of military operations to mop up a growing conspiracy involving arms dealers and nano technology that doesn't seem to far fetched in fact also seen before in other science fiction films. The best part of course is echoing some sentiments whenever opportunity allows in lambasting a superpower's policies including a subtle jibe that most of the world's terrorist type problems stem from ineptness and how the monster came to grow from within.G.I. Joe was much better than expected as pure entertainment and you really shouldn't give this a miss as it might just restore your faith in bigaction summer popcorn flicks that takes a huge leaf out of their cartoon counterparts. A bevy of good looking established stars in its casting also helped in making this watchable even though some like Ray Park had to spend all his time behind a mask. See if you can spot an uncredited Brandan Fraser as well!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was very looking forward to the G.I. Joe film not because I'm a fan of the toys or the animated series but because I knew what to expect tons of cool special effects and some really exciting action. And guess what? That's exactly what the film provides.If there's something G.I. Joe is it's an action movie. But unlike movies like Transformers 2 Sommers' motion picture actually succeeds at providing with walltowall action. Unlike Michael Bay he doesn't insert explosions every three seconds and doesn't seem to have the need of shaking his camera like a madman so that the audience doesn't have a clue of what's happening. Yes there is a lot of action in this movie but it is of the comprehensible sort meaning the viewer actually knows if his favorite characters are in danger and also has the opportunity of enjoying and being marveled by the special effects instead of watching balls of fire and tons of CGI that doesn't make sense. Sommers' approach to action is almost oldfashioned and I thanks him for that. Of course that doesn't mean that all of the action sequences work beautifully some of them are a little tiresome actually. There is no denying though that the Paris action setpiece is quite awesome both in terms of special effects and in terms of how excited and tense it made me feel.Now regarding the special effects... yes they are by no means perfect and yes the film does have a sortof artificial look from time to time but it's nothing serious. Sommers always inserts a lot of computergenerated effects and other extravagances in his movies and although these kinds of tricks have improved in quality during the last couple of years it's always hard to make them look 100 realistic if you're inserting them virtually everywhere. The movie doesn't have an infinite budget after all. Nevertheless because the film doesn't take itself excessively seriously unlike Revenge of the Fallen these kinds of mistakes are allowed. I even accepted a final revelation which occurs during the last few minutes of runningtime and which includes a new and very cheesy Darth Vaderlooking bad guy. Why? Because I accepted the fact that this is a toy movie and that nothing expect maybe some of the characters should be taken too seriously.Performances are what should be expected from this kind of movie. Not particularly strong but not bad either. The standout is Sienna Miller who is almost unrecognizable with black hair and dark glasses. She looks really hot though. She seems to be having lots of fun playing the bad guy and thus manages to create a very memorable and entertaining character. Rachel Nichols is cute and believable as Scarlett and Marlon Wayans is great as Ripcord he can be funny and dorky from time to time but because he's also a pretty good soldier and because he's never too goofy one can take his character kinda seriously. His flirting with Nichols was great not only because it was fun but because it was  for a lack of a better word  awesome to see an interracial romance making an appearance in a bigbudget Hollywood blockbuster. Christopher Eccleston is effective as a megalomaniac villain and despite their small parts the likes of Dennis Quaid always reliable that bloke Brendan Fraser and Jonathan Pryce ! are memorable. The one disappointment though is Channing Tatum who as Duke is almost as wooden as Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker. He looks good during the action sequences but that's about it.The main reason though of why G.I. Joe is so much superior to Revenge of the Fallen I know I'm comparing both movies a little too much but it's almost unavoidable is that the former actually has memorable and fun characters worth rooting for while the latter has virtually no characters and instead provides with a gazzilion CGI robots who look virtually all the same during the confusing action sequences. I like the fact that each Joe is given a backstory through flashbacks the most interesting is definitely the one concerning Snake Eyes and his rival Storm Shadow and I also like the fact that despite having very archetypical personalities each character is instantly recognizable and played with style. The screenplay might not be particularly smart although it's a million times wittier and organized than the one for Michael Bay's picture but it accomplishes what it sets to do provide with nice and entertaining characters a plot that actually makes sense and action sequences that don't feel repetitive or dull.So has Stephen Sommers and his creative team managed to fulfill expectations? Well considering buzz for the movie a couple of months ago was horribly negative it won't be hard for the filmmakers to please their audience but even if expectations had been higher I don't think viewers would have emerged disappointed from theatres. I can say I was a Joe virgin before watching the movie I knew nothing about the characters the plot or the role of the Cobra organization in the series' mythos but after watching the film I am now more interested in everything related to it. Needless to say the movie does do a really good job at presenting the characters and the plot to newbies and I'm sure that for diehard fans it is a very entertaining and visuallypleasing way to revisit their favorite characters. With its comprehensible action cool special effects effective performances and mildlyinteresting plot G.I. Joe is one of the better bigbudget action extravaganzas I've seen in some time. In short what Transformers 2 should have been and sadly wasn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just don't get it. Stephen Sommers bounces back from the colossal disaster Van Helsing only to give us something worse. The fact that this piece of st took 170 million to make is more talked about than the movie itself and for good reason. When you spend that much money on a film it usually at least looks like money well spent despite Sommers look what the same studio Paramount did with 30 million Cloverfield. Guess what writing doesn't cost that much money and clearly there was no real effort in that department. Why when you can spend some of that money on insane practical stunts and create memorable sequences like some other directors do would you spend it on creating bases under polar ice caps and the sands of Egypt which look like cartoon sequences edited into live  action? The CGI was BAD very bad. The action was as expected non stop stereotype and irritating. The stunts were non  existent as everything was CG. The women kick more arse than everyone else. The Paris sequence was pretty much everything you see in the trailers and clips disappointing when you see the whole thing instead of quick cuts. It was always obvious that this film would hide a lack of substance with style but quite frankly it was not very stylish. Snake Eyes is sadly immensely under used Channing Tatum is the worst actor I've seen since Hayden Christensen pathetic musical score pathetic dialogue and attempts at humor even from the usually  funny Marlon Wayans completely non  memorable performances from everyone else Dennis Quaid might as well have not been in the movie for everyone who's watched the trailers and exclusive clips that's pretty much all there is in the movie. It is at best pathetic even by Stephen Sommers summer blockbuster standards. Hard to think Stuart Beattie could write a screenplay this bad you'll see what I'm talking about if you're unfortunate enough to watch the characters' so  called back stories and the now requisite leading onto a sequel ending. Cheesy cheap  looking which I still cannot comprehend not cool worse than sister concern Revenge of The Fallen and I have a horrible feeling Stephen Sommers may have destroyed a potentially mind  blowing franchise even before it kicks off. Since every other franchise seems to be doing it these days who knows maybe a reboot with another director? Unheard of for a second film I know but this is how bad it is and I do not want to see it die before it's born. Saving grace if there is such a thing for this filmRay Park as Snake Eyes his costume more than anything since they wasted his presence and potential Brendan Fraser's second  long cameo which I personally enjoyed more than the whole movie the concepts in the movie which sadly were taken to a Sommers  ish level in terms of execution  Sienna Miller  Rachel Nichols not their pathetic ten  second fight sequence".

The fact that this piece of st took 170 million to make is more talked about than the movie itself and for good reason.

It reminds me of the P.O.S. Trek Trek 'relaunch' they did a bit ago. Why do they even bother? They actually did a cool and creative thing with Cobra Commander though. He turns out to be who everyone thinks is Dr. Mindbender but is in reality someone else. He's been horribly disfigured by a bunker explosion he and the notsogood Dr. were in together but they never do say what happened to the real Mindbender. He's on a respirator device like Darth Vader and later reveals he's wearing a wig. Sadly they then screw this up at the end of the movie by making him put on a ridiculous looking mask that makes him sound like a white guy trying to be James Earl Jones doing Darth Vader on a bad day.Yeah apparently the spoof for this movie was already made by Matt Stone and Trey Parker it's called 'Team America'. You're better off watching that as it was much more entertaining with far better writing. Kim Jong Il's performance in that movie was absolutely breathtaking. As for GI Joe the Rea... er... GI Joe the International Minoriteam wait until it comes on TV not even worth renting IMO.".

	schema:reviewBody "Albino Farm is a horrorthriller in the vain of The Hills Have Eyes Texas Chainsaw and Wrong Turn. While I definitely wouldn't say it was in the ballpark of the first two mentioned films I would say it was a pretty valiant and entertaining attempt. SPOILERS The story starts out in a typical and conventional way with 4 college students on a road trip deep in the Ozarks. After encountering a hillbilly dwarf in the center of the road who seems most interested in scraping up some roadkill for his family stew the students find themselves with a flat tire leading them further off the beaten path. The next scene wasn't my favorite a tad too much exposition with the Pulp Fiction guy recounting a local creepy legend called  of course  the Albino Farm. But once the group finds themselves in the town of Shiloh the movie gets quite interesting. Without getting too much in to the plot there is a cleverly used bible passage which not only enlightens our heroes to more of the mystery but draws them further in. They eventually split in to two teams and the movie takes off. Chris Jericho of wrestling fame did a fantastic job of creating a character that is nothing like what he plays on TV. He is the father of two twinhicks that lures 2 of our protagonists further in to the woods and eventually in to the farm itself. His scenes with the main character of Brian were well paced and executed  very good stuff. Eventually all of our heroes make it in to the farm where chaos reigns. The group gets split up and the carnage begins. There are actually some interesting kills  including a scene with a grotesque female mutant hillbilly girl who wants to  get this  mate with Brian! Classic! The ending is somewhat befuddling. I'm sure some will come away a bit miffed. Without giving away too much it is even a tad ambiguous for my taste. Does the girl stay in the farm? Is she now one of them? Does she get killed?? But I do get what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish. The direction was strong with nice pacing and there were even some nicely composed shots  especially at the end before the main girl runs in to the tent. Bottom line the film isn't going to change anyone's life but it was a fun entry in to the horror pantheon heck it does have a great title Albino Farm! That in and of itself is worth something. Overall I enjoyed it and would watch a sequel. Hopefully they would reveal more of the actual farm and its history. I give it 3.54 out of 5 stars.".

I was unfortunately sucked into this grim tale by my curiosity about he mystique and legend that surrounds the Ozark terrain.After the opening credits which were good thats why it gets a 2 you start noticing the shoddy camera work and FX jeez these were bad. I in fact thought that this was in fact a parody of movies in this Genre in the vein of Sam Raimi or even the Wayans Bros until i realized that this was in fact horrible attempt at entertainment. The actors were absolutely atrocious I wanted them to get slaughtered especially the white dude. Someone inviting that much trouble ought to get it. But let me tell you you are going to have to wait for some gore its only in the latter part past 40min that you will get a dose what i consider the worst CGI i have ever seen worst than a Mark Dacascos movie. The make ups on the deformed people where so bad you could in fact notice that they were wearing masks. MASKS you gotta be kidding.As for Y2J he acts better on a WWE episode than he ever will in a movie. The Rock Cena even Kennedy have managed moderate to big budget roles the rock has even made it his full time career i don't understand how Y2J would pick a crappy movie like this. Don't believe the hype believe the word.Bottom Line on my top 10 crappolla list just behind the 5th Commandment and in front of 10 Dead Men. Jeez Louiz".

I see where the filmmakers were going with it and what they were trying to accomplish but again I would have liked a different ending. I also thought the make was fantastic. They created some characters and monsters that were quite memorable. I also thought all the stuff dealing with the bible passages was clever. Overall I would recommend seeing this film.".

I honestly believe anybody off the street could do a better job than the director did on this movie. The actors are terrible I can ensure none of them will get any more roles in movies after this disaster. The movie looks like something you could achieve by running around in open fields with a camcorder screaming. AVOID this garbage at all costs. It's a terrible ripoff from movies such as Wrong Turn and Hills have eyes. Chris Jericho can't act his accent changes half way through the movie and he looks like a complete JOKE....a PRO WRESTLER and looks to be about the same size as these stupid college kids. I just hope the budget was no more than 20 because thats how bad this really is.".

Some of the action takes place in a cave the ending is surprisingly effective and every once in awhile there's an bizarre moment that catches you off guard such as an elderly lady breast feeding a mutant baby or a pigfaced mutant woman in cut off shorts who does a strip tease before ripping out a guy's teeth with a hook.

	schema:reviewBody "What could've been a very crafty and very intelligent piece of horror turns into a very formulaic and very familiar piece of the slasher film genre we see far too much of. Albino Farm's premise is interesting but the execution is very poor and we can see the movie struggle to maintain its short eightyfive minutes by delaying action until around forty minutes in.Albino Farm takes forever to get going and when it does you only wish it had more to offer. The film focuses on four teenagers Sursok Lagano Richey and Bala who venture out to document the Ozark Mountains for a school project. When the duo get a flat they head out to a gas station with a strange unsettling owner who warns them to turn back. One of the dumbest cockiest lamebrained teenagers in recent memory convince the gang to travel up to see what the hype is about.They stumble across the town of Shiloh which looks like a ghosttown. They learn that many of the town folk fear a legend called Albino Farm. The teens split up with two going in search of the farm and two going in search of a church. After doing the genius thing of getting picked up by a hick and two identical twins they are taken out and abandoned at the Albino Farm. Let the horror movie clichs jokes antics and chase scenes begin.I believe this film is based off of the legend of a group of College students adventuring around the Ozark Mountains and never returning home. Either this is the legend itself or a followup to it. Whatever it is it is poorly executed.Low budget horror films can't be critiqued by their budget. What you have it what you have and I believe I shouldn't penalize the producers directors etc for working with what they had. I can respect that. But so much is done poorly. In order to believe the characters you have to throw logic out the window. What makes you want to venture out to the deep part of the Ozarks in the first place? Curiosity kills the cat and when you stumble upon creepy woods it's likely to kill you as well.The sound editing is messy. One point there is dead silence the next moment the bass almost blows your speakers followed up by very dim talking. Your remote may need to be in your hands at all times for this. Not to mention the pitch dark lighting may call for a brightness tune up. What a temperamental film. You need to pretty much modify everything on your TV to be satisfied while watching Albino Farm.This also seems to be influenced by every redneckslasher film on the market today. Throw three great horror films like The Hills Have Eyes The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Wrong Turn in a blender and it'll spit out this mediocre horror flick. Creativity is here but the execution is like a dog on a leash fighting to inch itself closer to its desired destination while the owner is tugging back. Imagine the producers as the owner the movie itself as the dog and the destination being typical redneck film schlock. There's a metaphor that will sum this up.The makeup effects is where this film starts to redeem itself in quality. The effects on the creatures are realistic but then the film wants to add some digital effects on some of the people. You can pretty much do that on any free editing system and do it a lot better. Not being a Mac user I still am sure this can be done one way or another on the Photobooth program that comes free with the computer. They can do that but they can't add some sort of effect to brighten up the scenery.I can tell the crew were serious about making this film like the legend or something close to it. They didn't fall on their neck as much as they fell on their face in their attempts with this. Albino Farm still could've been great bmovie horror. What we have here is just lazy editing and a lazy script ripping off so much of every other movie in its genre. It's a copy of a copy.Starring Chris Jericho Richard Christy Tammin Sursok Duane Whitaker Alicia Lagano Nick Richey and Sunkrish Bala. Directed by Joe Anderson and Sean McEwen.".

From The Hills Have Eyes to Deliverance to Wrong Turn nothing better or more American than a bunch o' city slickers going' places they shouldn't poking' their noses around and getting' said noses eaten off. It's the best. And Albino Farm is another worthy addition in to the whitetrash bloodsplattered inbredkiller horror film lexicon. From the beginning of the story you are sucked in by wispy almost dreamlike shots circa the 1950's of 2 young boys on their bikes baseball cards in spokes!as they peddle through an AllAmerican ma pa and apple pie town turn the corner and head out deep into the neighboring woods. There we get our first glimpse of the namesake Albino Farm and an effective horrific tease of its mysterious legend. Without giving away too much the film then bounces to modern day where a group of university students on a midterm assignment exploring local legends and the roots of myths are forced off the road by a roadkillscraping dwarf obviously bent on bringing home some vittles to the kinfolk. A flat tire forces our heroes deeper off the beaten path where they encounter local after disturbingly creepy local  leading them deeper in to the mystery of the farm and finally to the farm itself. As you can see from the premise there is some unique stuff counterbalanced with the typical genre doing's we've seen time and time again. And while at times the pacing of the film could be tightened up and there are moments when you can see what's gonna happen next from a WalmartSuperCentermileaway there are moments of fresh exciting and truly invigorating horror to be had can anyone say SPOILER!!! Grandmachurchlady breastfeeding a deformed baby??? Gross yes! But also superweird and ridiculously wonderful! While for the most part Albino Farm is lowbudget fare the effects by IMP Creations are realistic the acting pretty darn good and the story enough to keep one engaged to the bitter and shockingly surprising and nonclichd! end. Chris Jericho of WWE wrestling fame and Richard Christy of the Howard Stern Show let me put my private part on Sal the Stockbrokers face fame turn in inspired performances. But the main four college friends played by Sunkrish Bala Tammin Sursok Alicia Lagano and Nick Richey deserve the most credit. They take typical dialog make it their own and actually make you care and even like! these characters. Oh and Bianca Barnett who played the oversexed but careful if you shun me because hell hath no furry like a PigBitch scorned was hot hot HOT!! Makes this girl wanna give up on the nonmutated dating pool and switch to pork the other white meat for' sure! Definitely fun for Halloween and while it isn't the best of all time if nothing else the girls are hot the blood flows well and there's even a laugh or two in the right place. I give it a mutated oversized deformed unwashed Stuckey's hillbilly thumbsup. Let's hope there's a sequel as I'm ready to go back in the farm anytime! Ewwwwee squeal like a pig girl!!!!!".

This movie feels like it was filmed on someones home video camera. The cheapness is the main thing. It's just unpleasant to sit through. It feels like The audio was horrible and the continuity was often off with characters moving ever so slightly in most scenes which was noticeable and annoying to watch. I don't know why you would agree to make this movie I have worked on film sets before and you can tell when people know what they are doing or not these people clearly were rushing. Even watching a sitcom is more realistic and fun to watch. Take Dead Set the British TV series for example that was not a huge budget production but was an awesome adventure to watch. The camera angles have been taken into account poorly for the cheap cameras.A rushed and cheaply filmed movie with no passion. 3 stars.".

After reading the back of the case I quickly realized that this film was in the torture genre which I do not favor but moved into the movie with optimism. The movie takes a slow approach building atmosphere with bizarre images runins with the locals and even takes a stab at a little bit of character development. The gore does not actually begin until a good 40 minutes into the film which some may consider bad and some good based on their opinion. Even after the gore began I still enjoyed the movie as it did not entirely abandon its atmosphere for blood and guts gross out scenes as many do. This isn't to say there are not some nasty scenes. I was also surprised to not see a single rape or sex scene which is another overly used piece in gore films today although their are three brief moments of nudity.The acting and script was impressively tolerable even believable at times.The characters are as you would expect extremely typical horror cast of teens the macho douche the smart girl the dumb girl and the innocent guy. These character arche types can all feel a bit forced. The scenery and towns folk were well set up to fit the eerie desolate atmosphere.Overall I was pretty impressed with the films quality and kept me entertained the whole way through. You can still expect the usual tripping when the chase scenes begin and the seemingly suicidal stupid decisions as with any Bhorror or horror film in general but otherwise this was pretty decent entertaining kinda fun. 610 overall for Albino Farm from me.

The four split up with Stacey Tammin Sursok  Sanjay Sunkrish Bala asking some questions around town while Melody Alicia Langano  Brian Nick Richey head out to the albino farm itself after some locals offer to take them there. Once there however they discover a dark  terrifying secret while back at the town it seems not one normal person lives there as things get creepy for our teen protagonists...Written produced  directed by the pairing of Sean McEwen  Joe Anderson this is a pretty poor clichd ridden backwoods mutant Hillbilly teen horror slasher that has little to nothing going for it. The opening twenty odd minutes is a collection of horror film clichs with a group of city teens driving along in the middle of nowhere a punctured tyre the amazing revelation that their mobile phones don't work a slightly weird gas station attendant a sinister legend  a incomprehensible desire by the teens to investigate. This feels like a carbon copy of the opening of Wrong Turn 2003  then once the albino farm is mentioned it takes absolutely ages to get to it which makes for a very boring thirty odd minutes as anyone in the audience is well ahead of the game  knows that's where the film is going to end up  the fact it takes so long to do so just kills any interest tension or momentum the film had built up. Then once the mutants turn up you can throw in a large dollop of The Hills Have Eyes 2006  it's sequel with lots of running around in caverns at the end where there are lots of conveniently placed bottles of propane with which the heroine can use to eliminate the mutants now who left them just lying around? The character's are all horror clichs  it's very predictable as to who will be the lone survivor the plot is poor with not much reason behind anything there's no reason behind the albino farm itself no reason behind the mutants no reason behind the deformed townsfolk no reason for anyone to kill anyone  there's even a rubbish ending that makes no sense.I have a couple of big problems with Albino Farm on the production side of things first of all once the film switches to the albino farm it becomes incredibly dark  I found it was almost impossible to follow what was going on the mutants themselves never say anything so there's never any dialogue  they just scream  grunt  it becomes really annoying as there's like a straight twenty minute stretch of near darkness with quick editing  nothing on the soundtrack but grunts  screams. Then there's the low body count only three people die on screen someone gets a hook through their mouth someones arms are broken  head twisted around two character's arms are sewn together but little else in the way of gore. I also have no idea why it's called an albino farm there's no albino's there  it's not even a farm either.I would suspect that this had a low budget  it shows with a straight to video look it's competent but unspectacular. Apparently filmed in Missouri. The cast aren't great with ex Home and Away regular Sursok quite nice looking while Chris Jericho was a WWF wrestler I believe at one time.Albino Farm is a poor low budget horror film with clichs aplenty a rubbish story that doesn't make any real sense  a low body  nudity count that doesn't help matters either. Very little to recommend here I'm afraid.".

The character's are all horror clichs  it's very predictable as to who will be the lone survivor the plot is poor with not much reason behind anything there's no reason behind the albino farm itself no reason behind the mutants no reason behind the deformed townsfolk no reason for anyone to kill anyone  there's even a rubbish ending that makes no sense.I have a couple of big problems with Albino Farm on the production side of things first of all once the film switches to the albino farm it becomes incredibly dark  I found it was almost impossible to follow what was going on the mutants themselves never say anything so there's never any dialogue  they just scream  grunt  it becomes really annoying as there's like a straight twenty minute stretch of near darkness with quick editing  nothing on the soundtrack but grunts  screams. Then there's the low body count only three people die on screen someone gets a hook through their mouth someones arms are broken  head twisted around two character's arms are sewn together but little else in the way of gore. I also have no idea why it's called an albino farm there's no albino's there  it's not even a farm either.I would suspect that this had a low budget  it shows with a straight to video look it's competent but unspectacular. Apparently filmed in Missouri. The cast aren't great with ex Home and Away regular Sursok quite nice looking while Chris Jericho was a WWF wrestler I believe at one time.Albino Farm is a poor low budget horror film with clichs aplenty a rubbish story that doesn't make any real sense  a low body  nudity count that doesn't help matters either. Very little to recommend here I'm afraid.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is my very first film review so please be patient if I jump around a bit...The theme of Albino Farm is all too familiar by now. A group of college students happen upon a rural socially challenged town where they promptly stick their noses as well as various other body parts where they are not wanted. The result as any of the fans of this genre will happily tell you is copious amounts of bloodshedding in an effort to keep the outsiders from revealing their secrets. While the horror genre has been saturated with this type of film there are a few both independently and commercially produced that stand out amongst their peers. Albino Farm is one such film for a few reasons.First and foremost the plot of this film is unique enough to draw one's attention. In all honesty I felt the first half of the film could have been faster paced and the storyline could have been rewritten to get us to the Albino Farm a little quicker but at the same time I wouldn't necessarily say I was bored. It's clear that the writers and filmmakers took great care in setting the scene and establishing the characters but it does translate into a somewhat drawn out beginning. Once we do get to the Albino Farm and like the saying goes getting there IS half the fun! the action suspense and thrills begin. Of course we've all seen films where the antagonists are mutated cannibals either through Mother Nature's blunders or mankind's own abominations created by our need to wage war or build the better human being. In this case however these mutants are the products of the urban legends we've all heard many times. We've heard the stories and have all thought or perhaps asked aloud What happens if a pregnancy results from one of these unions? Albino Farm gives us the answer! And then there's Pig Bitch! The name alone should have true horror fans salivating! I've seen a couple of reviews that mentioned Chris Jericho and Tammin Sursok and these two do give great performances but Bianca Barnett stands out as the grotesquely erotic and vengeful Pig Bitch. Her makeup while outstanding and realistic limits her facial expressions and as a result Miss Barnett has to rely on body language and the grunting growling language of Pig Bitch to make her emotions known. In this way her talent and her love of her craft shine like the star she is surely destined to become. I for one definitely look forward to seeing her explore future roles!Finally Albino Farm is a fun film amusing at times and frightening at other times. This is definitely a welcome addition to the genre and well worth a watch at least once!".

Just try to ignore long complicated lip movements when the actor gives a threeword answer. Plus the Dubbed English is can be extremely FLAT and lacks emotion.The Film is dark clinically brutal and coherently themed. The scene is an orbital Psychiatric station around some unknown planet named Dante 01. The patientsinmates are all hopelessly criminally insane. And here arrives another patient with a coldeyed research doctor who begins to conduct notquitekosher nanotech psychonueral experiments on the inmates. On board the station already are two resident doctors one of whom has a dark secret of his own.The Sets are well thought through and definitive. You will feel the close tight confines of a Space Station and a sense of vulnerability both to space itself and empathize with the vulnerability of the inmates who seem to be caught in a maze of compartments wherein they are treated more like lab animals than patients.The problem and the reasons I rated this a 6 is the story line. SaintGeorge's history  origin is vague and not explained. Maybe in the French version there is some side explanation but not in the English dub. But if you ignore that omission the story did move with a roughedged deliberation that is part intelligent prisondrama and Medical Science Gone wrong an interesting combo.The new Doctor commences experimental injections on the prisoners with some rather icky internal graphics and outward pain and suffering. At the same time SaintGeorge is manifesting some strange 'power' that has an origins with whatever the heck happened to him in the past.As you watch the movie you will be settling into watch what happens when SaintGeorge's power manifestations begin to go headtohead with the Doctor's twisted medical experiment. THIS was the script and the imbued storyline for the first two thirds of the movie which makes this movie different from MOST of the SciFi out there.Here is where I downgraded the movie down to a 6. Either they ran out of Time or Money or the good graces of the Producers because the ending was just slapped onto the end of this movie just for the sake of being able to say The End. One of the inmates acts of his own and accesses the station's system to send it powering out of orbit then locks the controls. Well. . .he IS criminally Insane. And That's what Criminally Insane people DO.Okay. . .except here's where the Movie ran out of Time or whatever because it goes from being cerebral SciFi and becomes suddenly Brainless.Because it turns out that the only way to stop disaster is to get to the Manual control which is only accessible INSIDE the Prisoner quarters? Oh. . .that makes Sense.And it gets better Once INSIDE the Prisoner quarters you then have to open a conduit filled with BOILING HOT cooling fluid and swim down a corridor to this little isolated room where the EMERGENCY CUTOFF is? Oh that makes even MORE Sense than before. I know and recognize the Mad Engineering Schematic gimmick. Emergency Switches that are ALWAYS located on the OPPOSITE end of a facility or Ship and the ONLY way to get to it is through a tunnel filled with Toothy Alien Monsters? And the only things that makes this gimmick work is that the male viewers usually get to ogle the scantily clad female heroine screaming alongside the hero as they fight their way to aforesaid 'Emergency Switch'.That doesn't happen here though. So put your beer down.Instead one of the Inmates VOLUNTEERS to dive INTO THE BOILING OIL and swim to the switch. Think 'Deep Frying'.Okay that's rich! But it's still workable if he were to don a spacesuit. . .They ARE on a Space Station after all. And he IS Insane?!?But NO! They rip and cut INSULATION douse it with water and wrap the fool up from head to toe in foamy strips that will only SUCK UP BOILING OIL Cooling fluid as ANY IDIOT will tell you it would. Think 'French Fry'.But at least they give him strap on Goggles. . .which come off while he's in the boiling oil. I will say that the fellow gave the Director and the audience some heartwrenchingly convincing SCREAMS before flicking the switch and then dying. Bravo! Bravo! Then the Next Scene has SaintGeorge outside in. . . a SPACE SUIT! And at this point the movie patently STOPS making sense. Although the Director made an attempt to hypnotize me. . .I think.It didn't work. The End STILL made no sense.But I found the first 34 of the movie very memorable nonetheless. Unfortunately the ending turned what could have been a truly epic cerebral SciFi film into a classic with Literary undercurrents into an interesting Saturday night Flop. I say watch this with your SciFi buff friends and have your own Vote competition.Lambert Wilson's talent was wasted here. WASTED.".

And That's what Criminally Insane people DO.Okay. . .except here's where the Movie ran out of Time or whatever because it goes from being cerebral SciFi and becomes suddenly Brainless.Because it turns out that the only way to stop disaster is to get to the Manual control which is only accessible INSIDE the Prisoner quarters? Oh. . .that makes Sense.And it gets better Once INSIDE the Prisoner quarters you then have to open a conduit filled with BOILING HOT cooling fluid and swim down a corridor to this little isolated room where the EMERGENCY CUTOFF is? Oh that makes even MORE Sense than before. I know and recognize the Mad Engineering Schematic gimmick. Emergency Switches that are ALWAYS located on the OPPOSITE end of a facility or Ship and the ONLY way to get to it is through a tunnel filled with Toothy Alien Monsters? And the only things that makes this gimmick work is that the male viewers usually get to ogle the scantily clad female heroine screaming alongside the hero as they fight their way to aforesaid 'Emergency Switch'.That doesn't happen here though. So put your beer down.Instead one of the Inmates VOLUNTEERS to dive INTO THE BOILING OIL and swim to the switch. Think 'Deep Frying'.Okay that's rich! But it's still workable if he were to don a spacesuit. . .They ARE on a Space Station after all. And he IS Insane?!?But NO! They rip and cut INSULATION douse it with water and wrap the fool up from head to toe in foamy strips that will only SUCK UP BOILING OIL Cooling fluid as ANY IDIOT will tell you it would. Think 'French Fry'.But at least they give him strap on Goggles. . .which come off while he's in the boiling oil. I will say that the fellow gave the Director and the audience some heartwrenchingly convincing SCREAMS before flicking the switch and then dying. Bravo! Bravo! Then the Next Scene has SaintGeorge outside in. . . a SPACE SUIT! And at this point the movie patently STOPS making sense. Although the Director made an attempt to hypnotize me. . .I think.It didn't work. The End STILL made no sense.But I found the first 34 of the movie very memorable nonetheless. Unfortunately the ending turned what could have been a truly epic cerebral SciFi film into a classic with Literary undercurrents into an interesting Saturday night Flop. I say watch this with your SciFi buff friends and have your own Vote competition.Lambert Wilson's talent was wasted here. WASTED.";

The film establishes itself from the off with a very confident and distinct visual style and sense of the deep dark void of space.A man arrives at a colony circling the fiery planet Dante his name and history unknown. The ship is a base for psychiatric research on a handful of criminals held as guineapigs and cut off from outside contact. The new man is seen as a messiah by some of the convicts a troublemaker by others as the psychiatrists carry out routine and risky genetic experiments with their DNA.The film maintains a heightened feeling of tension and claustrophobia that is almost migraine inducing but transfixing. The editing is first rate and the film is well acted Dominque Pinon a Caro and Jeunet regular appears. Unfortunately the plot keeps promising to go somewhere but ends up disappearing down a black hole of messianic symbolism and the dialogue is fairly bland and perfunctory. The violence is also almost sickening at times though this may not bother some.This is a very confidently directed film that is clearly the unique vision of one very creative visualist I only hope Caro could have applied his touch to better material and not surrender to pretensions of the religious and philosophical. I'm not suggesting that no film should try to tackle these things but this film doesn't deliver enough of anything else.

Mix in a little Cube throw in a dash of Alien 3 and sprinkle in some Powder for good measure and you have the undercooked hodgepodge of Dante 01. Good scifi is hard to come by these days mainly because I think it's the most high concept genre of film as well as the hardest to execute really well. Unfortunately despite some very interesting ideas and good production values it doesn't add up to much of anything when it was all over. Wilson's main character has almost zero lines in the film and isn't really even a main character. If you're going to have your main character remain essentially silent that's fine but for the love of Odin please make him interesting. I completely understood what was going on but it just didn't register with me as much as I was hoping it would. There is a sequence just before the last shot of the film with Wilson outside in space that was just so agonizingly excessive that I was swearing at the screen for it to stop which I hardly ever do. Maybe you'll have a different opinion which is fine. But for me no dice.".

The thematic is quite fine a deep space station used as a psychiatric facility is exiting knowing the visual taste of Caro and the cast is well done too but in the end every way you look at it the movie never fully unfold his potential.The story as mysterious it can be fail to be emotional or understandable at any level which is really disappointing considering you can't connect to any character at all  especially not with the main one  having a feeling of emptiness despite the solid material that could have been used in a much better way.The budget isn't large for this movie that's obvious and still the director pulled some extremely good shots and some solid acting while being uneven at times considering the budget I can only guess that some takes as to be done only a few times still beyond that there is nothing to properly think of. As said the story was somewhat promising at the beginning ... and sadly looks still promising at the end it's a tale with a slow beginning and no real end or ground to rely on  an etheral narration with some pretty visuals and scenes empty of meaning.If I were to make a comparison I'd pick The fountain. They look alike in many ways sharing a radical vision of moviemaking and story telling but where the fountain kept me involved in the character development process and opened some thoughts Dante 01 just got me lost somewhere loosing the meaning of it's concept  or maybe I never got it in the first place.Overall the movie itself isn't bad and you can see it without regrets it's still a nice movie but it's nothing more and that is probably the most disappointing thing about it  you don't feel more than looking at an OK film. Now I do hope Caro will be directing again and with a better budget and more freedom over his uncompromising style making this one just a trial step for better materials next time.".

	schema:headline " Space Fiction loves to discover and rediscover Secret of Immortality over and over again";
	schema:reviewBody "The whole story goes by in a space shuttle which is being used as a medical research center far away from the earth. 1 organization chief 1 psychiatrist and 3 guardians are in charge of 7 convicts. Those convicts are chosen haphazardly from the world. They are all average human beings some of them are murderers some of them are psychopaths. As the story progresses a genetic engineer woman comes to the space shuttle for a confidential experiment. While she was arguing with the psychiatrist on the case of conscience of making experiments over convicts' bodies a new convict is been delivered to the space shuttle who is very strangely sick dumb and hold on... No identity! This is Hint1 he is identityfree. When I complete all the hints I found out from the film I will explain them within the conclusion. Hint2 One of the mad convicts began believing that this sick dumb and unknown mankind is the Messiah sent from God and he gives him a name after a saint. Hint3 By time convicts fall apart into two confronting sides and turn against each other. 3 of them believe that the strange man came for help the other 4 think that he brought only curse and hatred. Hint4 After she gives a start to genetic experiments the genetic engineer woman injects the immortality virus into some of the convicts' bodies via their operator genes of the cellular membranes. Right after she delivers them to their rooms just before she is going to watch their behavioral change our strange guy shows up and takes the immortality virus out of their bodies and injects it to himself. He does this while everyone is asleep. Thus he makes everybody thinks of him that he can heal people and even he can vitalize a dead body. Hint5 Soon everyone becomes believers of him. After a while the space shuttle loses its route and is dazed by the magnetic flow of a planet then it comes to a crucial point to enter an ultra energy sphere. Our strange guy puts on an astronaut suit jumps out to space depletes all the energy of the sphere then he sends the space shuttle back to Earth. During the moment he was depleting the energy of the sphere using the power of his spiritual immortality the space shuttle turns upside down forms T shape which references the crucifixion of Christ.When you watch the end you might think that the strange guy might be the Messiah as the mad convict guessed from the beginning.In fact who is this strange man? He has been delivered to the space shuttle without nobodies' knowledge. Is he a spy of a worldbased confidential organizationlike CIA or NSA or is he a missionary of a secret and forbidden futuristic projectlike discovering the secret of immortality. Either way no computer no population databased software would be able to sniff out his identity. But which one is right? How do we know? Do we have to take a guess? Do we have to write a new scenario out of it just to understand it? Directing and writing of this movie completely fails at this point leaving viewers' minds confused.

	onyx:emotionText "The whole story goes by in a space shuttle which is being used as a medical research center far away from the earth. 1 organization chief 1 psychiatrist and 3 guardians are in charge of 7 convicts. Those convicts are chosen haphazardly from the world. They are all average human beings some of them are murderers some of them are psychopaths. As the story progresses a genetic engineer woman comes to the space shuttle for a confidential experiment. While she was arguing with the psychiatrist on the case of conscience of making experiments over convicts' bodies a new convict is been delivered to the space shuttle who is very strangely sick dumb and hold on... No identity! This is Hint1 he is identityfree. When I complete all the hints I found out from the film I will explain them within the conclusion. Hint2 One of the mad convicts began believing that this sick dumb and unknown mankind is the Messiah sent from God and he gives him a name after a saint. Hint3 By time convicts fall apart into two confronting sides and turn against each other. 3 of them believe that the strange man came for help the other 4 think that he brought only curse and hatred. Hint4 After she gives a start to genetic experiments the genetic engineer woman injects the immortality virus into some of the convicts' bodies via their operator genes of the cellular membranes. Right after she delivers them to their rooms just before she is going to watch their behavioral change our strange guy shows up and takes the immortality virus out of their bodies and injects it to himself. He does this while everyone is asleep. Thus he makes everybody thinks of him that he can heal people and even he can vitalize a dead body. Hint5 Soon everyone becomes believers of him. After a while the space shuttle loses its route and is dazed by the magnetic flow of a planet then it comes to a crucial point to enter an ultra energy sphere. Our strange guy puts on an astronaut suit jumps out to space depletes all the energy of the sphere then he sends the space shuttle back to Earth. During the moment he was depleting the energy of the sphere using the power of his spiritual immortality the space shuttle turns upside down forms T shape which references the crucifixion of Christ.When you watch the end you might think that the strange guy might be the Messiah as the mad convict guessed from the beginning.In fact who is this strange man? He has been delivered to the space shuttle without nobodies' knowledge. Is he a spy of a worldbased confidential organizationlike CIA or NSA or is he a missionary of a secret and forbidden futuristic projectlike discovering the secret of immortality. Either way no computer no population databased software would be able to sniff out his identity. But which one is right? How do we know? Do we have to take a guess? Do we have to write a new scenario out of it just to understand it? Directing and writing of this movie completely fails at this point leaving viewers' minds confused. This is not a proper storylayering structure. The second hint I found out indicates that viewers have to believe that the strange man is the Messiah since his name is credited as Saint Georges officially. If this guy is the Messiah how come does he carry the same virus that the genetic engineer woman wants to inject to everybody? Is this a coincidence or a logical mistake?

	schema:reviewBody "Any fan of the imagination rich City of Lost Children and Delicatessen should know that both were helmed by Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro. Jeunet has gone solo and done magnificently for himself with films like A Very Long Engagement. And now Mr. Caro steps into the director chair alone. For fans of said above films getting the chance to see a new film by either is like asking me if I would like some Mountain Dew. God yes! The picture revolves around a space station which is being used as psychiatric prison that consists of a population of 7 prisoners and a team of 5 employees. At the beginning of the film a new scientist and a mysterious new patient is brought aboard the ship. With these two the station begins unraveling from it's normal routines and begins heading into violent and unbelievable territories. The crew begins arguing with one another because of the new scientist's ideals and orders while the prisoners are freaking out due to the new prisoners nature and abilities. With everything coming to ahead the prison is beginning to fall apart.From what I can gather from the other reviews this film is pretty much hit or miss. I'm on the side who dug it. The film more than anything is very familiar in the sense that you know it's directed by Caro. It's stylish with great camera shots and it has an atmosphere that oozes scifi prison. And with familiar actors from past Jeunet and Caro films like Mr. Pinon there's no complaining whatsoever in the acting department. The writing itself is also very good. It's well thought out interesting and intelligent. Caro and Jeunet are always great at delivering good dialogue and this is no different.My issue with the film lies within the story itself. The film plays mostly like a mystery. The new scientist is doing experiments on the prisoners and you obviously know it's pretty inhumane but you don't me I didn't ever grip exactly what's going on with the treatments. And with our mysterious prisoner you do by the end understand who he is and what he's about kinda but up to this point it's very up in the air. And there are a few scenes when the scientists are talking among each other where the movie begins to drag a little bit. Nevertheless the movie plays out in an intriguing fashion with more than enough things going on that kept this viewer happy and entertained.I see some pretty petty gripes some people are having with the film concerning symbolism and that it felt like it wasn't long enough. I do agree with the length issue because it seemed the movie would have benefited with a tad more explanations. But the symbolism issue is solely based on that person's issue with beliefs. That stuff bothers you then you'll have an issue. Doesn't bother me in the slightest.Dante 01 overall is a unique interesting film with a fantastic look and feel but it does feel like it could have been much better. With that said I enjoyed it and this flick should definitely be seen by all fans of Caro.".

The story takes place in a psychiatric facility orbiting around a burning planet deep in space and populated by little more than a dozen people so the scale is pretty intimist. The patients of this space hospital are all death row inmates who have agreed to serve as guinea pigs for behaviorchanging treatments in order to win a few years of life. The routines of the whole compound are disrupted when a new patient with intriguing abilities Lambert arrives escorted by a new doctor the beautiful Linh Dan Pham ordered to test new treatments on the inmates.You will soon realize upon watching the first few minutes of this movie that everything that happens in it is a metaphor and that's all I will say about that in order not to spoil anything.I have nothing but praise for all the elements of this movie. The actors are top notch especially the inmates as well as the direction the art direction and the story which all together manage with great success the most important aspect of any movie of that kind to suspend our disbelief. The immersion was complete and I have not for one second questioned the how's and why's of the setting. The movie didn't feel too long or too short and the ending was satisfying and brought a sufficient amount of closure while still leaving many aspects of the story open for personal interpretation.Overall a great experience that I would recommend to anyone.".

The most annoying thing about this film is that it tortures you with obvious religious symbols and gestures until even the dumbest viewer will notice it.Avoid this film at any cost.".

The pace of the film is painfully slow. The new prisoner heals some of his fellows in a way that doesn't make sense at all you have to call that mystical. Every time he does it it looks exactly the same. The most annoying thing about this film is that it tortures you with obvious religious symbols and gestures until even the dumbest viewer will notice it.Avoid this film at any cost.";

The acting was pretty weak overall but the material was thin. The production was pretty good for a cheap scifi.The Christian symbolism was laid on so thick you could actually smell it. It wasn't even symbolism  it was iconography. Some christians and nonchristians alike will find it offensive or tedious for that reason. It is hard to promote any given religion in a film without coming off lame.Hope we see more scifi from France.".

One is a new psychoanalyst I would say and the other one a mysterious prisoner whose origins are unknown. Ands this is exactly what the movie is about. he is referred to as a the help of god by one of the convicts.I do recommend the movie just for thinkers and to those who appreciate independent cinema. there is a total lack of the commercial type of editing or story. This movie isn't slow but could be for those who like Die Hard 4.0 genres. The direction above all is very studied lots of different angles and a very good creation of the rhythm and psychotic style of the film.Based on very philosophical means and very deep thinking into what we did to people in the past and we still do you must pay fully attention to that one.9 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "If you deplore Christianity or even the symbolic presentation of mostly Christian ideas even in a science fiction setting you need not apply. This movie though visually striking and psychologically humanitarian has very little back story or outright purpose other than to signify the virtue and creative power of self sacrifice. The imagery employed for the most part is obviously intended for the layman but some deeper mysteries are also represented through the use of some lesser known and more profound symbolism. Every aspect of this film is developed to signify philosophical and spiritual concepts from the names of the various characters to the very shape of the space station on which the story plays out which happens to be the unfolded fourdimensional hypercube. Without going into to much detail suffice it to say if you do not appreciate abstract symbolism for the sake of its ability to communicate higher knowledge and secret wisdom then you most likely will not fully appreciate this film. That is not to say that there is nothing else to enjoy as the acting for the most part is competent and the set design unsettlingly claustrophobic and nightmarishly stark so as to create a truly unnerving experience. I enjoyed this movie very much though I feel with a little more development of the story it could have been much more accessible for the sometimes profane and often uninitiated masses. Donnie Darko Pans Labyrinth and The Fountain are ideologically similar films that may be more accessible andor more compelling simply for their ability to be interpreted differently by those with a disdain for Christ and their better conceptualized approaches more fully developed plot lines and larger budgets... 8 out 10 stars!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is what might be called postmodern naturalism. Director Kiduk Kim tells a brutal story without comment and without mercy. He reminds us of some human truths that will make some viewers uncomfortable and he invites controversy.First two things Spoilers to come so if you haven't seen this movie you might want to stop reading now.Second if you've seen the movie only once and are scratching your head you're not alone.Here's what happens Hanki Jaehyeon Jo a street tough pimp walking along in a South Korean city spies this very pretty and privileged college girl Sunhwa Won Seo sitting on a bench waiting for her boyfriend. The girl is everything Hanki desires. He sits down next to her. She pretends not to notice him while she talks on her cell phone to her boyfriend. When she does deign to notice him and his desire for her she shirks back in horror at his dirty lowerclass presumption and gets up. Her boyfriend arrives while she throws ugly glances at Hanki. Hanki can't take it anymore and grabs her and forcefully kisses her as the boyfriend beats him about the head. Some soldiers arrive on the scene and beat the tar out of Hanki. As a parting gesture pretty girl spits on Hanki as he is held by the soldiers.That's the setup. It's the kind of setup that cries out for revenge or at least a comeuppance which is what I expected. Or perhaps pretty college girl and the bad guy will find true love and overcome their social differences. What actually happens is beyond expectation in a way that is likely to stun and totally engage the viewer.Pretty girl is at a book store. She compromises herself in the viewer's eyes by tearing a page out of an art book and putting it in her purse. This can be seen as the fatal moral flaw that leads to her degeneration. Hanki sees this. He has been following her. Near her on the book display is a fat wallet. Pretty college girl grabs it looks both ways and puts it in her purse. This is the fatal moral flaw leading to entrapment and a descent into hell. She hurries to the bathroom and in the stall opens the wallet and takes out the money. Meanwhile the guy who lost the wallet is told presumably by the bad guy that she has the wallet and is in the bathroom. By the time he gets there she is gone. He chases after her and finally catches her. He roughs her up calls her a pickpocket and then forces her to go to a loan shark and sign an agreement with her body as collateral for money that he says was in the wallet.This might be called the turn as the setup takes on a startling twist.Next Sunhwa is forced into prostitution by Hanki. She makes some feeble attempts to get away but mysteriously has nowhere to go it seems and anyway is too afraid to run. She realizes that she is going to lose her 21yearold virginity so she begs her captors to let her lose it to her boyfriend. Hanki and his fellow thugs mysteriously oblige. However the boyfriend is confused and doesn't get the job done. They pull him out of the car slap him around dump him and Sunhwa is back at the showcase on the street. Through a twoway mirror Hanki watches her lose her virginity to a forceful client.Question number one why doesn't Hanki ever speak? Question number two why does he watch her behind the twoway mirror instead of taking her himself? The answer comes later in the film when we do hear him speak for the first time. His voice is a high shriek. Guess what his unique problem is.And then comes the resolution. Yes this is a love story of sorts and yes they do fall in love in a way that is debased and seemingly fated. He's a pimp and she's now a prostitute. This works out since he is able to vicariously experience her sexually and she is able to thereby serve the man she loves. And together they can make a living.There is also a supernatural element in the film that suggests that the story is part wishfulfillment fantasy by Hanki. His ability to beat up the other guys and survive knife wounds fairly begs credulity. During the course of the film he loses enough blood to supply a small hospital. And the scene where both he and Sunhwa appear together on the beach as if by magic is more mystical than realistic.Director Kiduk Kim's message seems to be that animal passion will win out in the end and that humans are despite the facades they put on just animals doing animallike things in the human jungle and deliverance comes only when one realizes his or her nature and gives into it. Kiduk Kim makes us identify with the bad guy and feel that he and pretty girl are no worse or no better than anyone else.In short I found this movie disturbing like something from say novelist Cormac McCarthy. I am thinking especially of his novel Child of God. That title is ironic in the sense that his antiheroic protagonist really is whatever we may say or think or however bestial his behavior a child of God while Kiduk Kim's title Bad Guy Nabbeun namja is also ironic in the sense that Hanki is by societal standards certainly a bad guy but by naturalistic or cosmic standards no better or worse than the pretty college girl.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an extremely good film  highly recommended. It will not be to everyone's taste but if you are not afraid of thinking during a film then you should find plenty to take away from this one.Bad Guy is a film based on the central premise of a relationship built between what is effectively a hostagetaker and his hostage. What transpires is a stream of abuses powershifts emotional turmoil love hate violence sex and almost every other aspect of life. This is an extremely original story well told with fascinating characters that are extremely human... both the good and bad sides of humanity.The production values are very high great acting direction cinematography script music everything is top notch. Typically Korean films are very much based in real characters social issues and have an earthy approach that humanises their films beyond those of most countries. Bad Guy is no exception... while it is violent confrontational and decidedly dark it bristles with underlying emotion and shows life without the rose coloured glasses. The characters are at times extremely emotional and at others almost entirely emotionally void as they struggle constantly to keep their balance in circumstances that are spiraling around them.This is not an 'easy' film in that it does not hand feed the viewer there are no 'Jaws' style music queues to let you know when to be scared. You will need to work out how to feel for yourself with this one which is fairly rare in this day and age. As said earlier this movie is not for everyone however if the concept sounds like something that interests you then you should enjoy this film. If on the other hand you don't like the idea of watching a film based on the idea of a man forcing a woman into a life of sexual servitude then stay well away from this film.".

	schema:headline " Despite misgivings a powerful and excellent film";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film shortly after seeing the same director's The Isle and was much more affected by this production although they are both striking works. Like the earlier film Bad Guy is a tale of obsession between lovers who exist on the edge of human relations and features some disturbing scenes. There's a sadomasochistic thread common in those Kiduk Kim's films I have seen which some viewers will understandably find controversial. The major characters are isolated one is tempted to say insulated from humanity and develop their own fiercely peculiar interactions. There's the exploited lake girl also a whore who tends the pontoon huts in The Isle miles from civilisation and the murderer who seeks his hideout on the water. There's the student held as prostitute imprisoned in her booth and the largely mute brothel thug who falls for her frequently stuck admiringly behind his viewing glass. These are people apart from the rest of the world by reason of misfortune or status who hold our attention as they eventually come together. Unlike the animal cruelty and fish hook fetishism exhibited in The Isle Bad Guy's principal talking point lies in the changing relationship between an unwilling whore and her abductors. Bad Guy's victim is 'hooked' against her will just as securely as are the fish in The Isle. Inveigled into prostitution after a tough guy develops a romantic fixation on her in the street she gradually comes to accept her new condition in life the advances of her captor and even grows to 'like' being in the arms of her customers. I use inverted commas for this word as the idea that a woman can gradually enjoy her forced acquiescence into moral degradation and enter into a voluntary relationship with a tormentor is debatable to say the least. There's a scene in the film which neatly describes the dilemma. The thug spends his first night with his love an unconsummated encounter after which she sleeps on the floor beside him. She has been intimidated then reassured he ardent yet constrained by his feelings. First thing next morning he rises studies her room and spends a moment on straightening a nail in her wall. Through his one way mirror set in the wall he has previously seen her at her most pathetic trying unsuccessfully to hang up a garment. Clearly this brief DIY is a moment of loving thought out of place in any black and white view of their peculiar relationship. In fact Bad Guy is full of moments of tenderness aided greatly by the plaintive melody of the score and the intense chemistry between the two leads. One superbly staged scene is where the two kiss through the oneway glass she unaware of his secret response to her longing at least until his lighter flame belatedly flickers his visage into view later. Another is as she resignedly dons a trashy wig and applies thick lipstick. He looks on again in secret aghast at her depression unable  or unwilling  to interfere. Far from being a vicious peeping tom by this stage he is practically a protector transfixed by an obsession as a couple of times he even dashes in to rescue her from unwanted advances. Fresh from a brutal world the mute is not violent to his ward nor does he rape her and by the end of the film his possession is less physical than it is emotional. Add to this on the one occasion he speaks the sudden sound of his high pitched voice vocal chords presumably damaged by a conspicuous throat injury so aptly suggestive of a eunuch's speech and the nature of his character can be seen quite differently.Outside of this central relationship one might nitpick at less than satisfactory plot points. How the thug recovers so abruptly from lifethreatening wounds for instance or his spell in prison during which legal processes seems to take no time at all by reference to an extended fantasy is the usual answer an occurrence which further undermines the allegations of misogyny. Or the girl's prompt location of the missing parts of the photograph itself symbolic of her fractured relationships beneath a considerable expanse of anonymous sand at the beach and so on. Kiduk Kim's use of the shore line as an emotional 'noman's zone' incidentally reminds one of the importance of such moments in Takeshi Kitano's oeuvre. The overall impression however is of quite an achievement and one which is perhaps more mature about the unpredictable nature of love and attraction than the director has been earlier. In short Bad Guy is no bad film and despite some misgivings about the moral premise of the piece is well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bad Guy Nabbeun namja is an earlier film of Kiduk Kim that is probably being released now in the U.S. due to the success of Spring Summer Fall Winter... and Spring Bom yeoreum gaeul gyeoul geurigo bom but fans of that visually entrancing parable should be warned how very different this exploration of the depths of human nature is.The style has some similarity in that there is no exposition and we have to connect images that tell a tale of two very different people over time. Context is everything as voyeurism keeps repeating along a sexual spectrum of men and women together  to romantic or erotic or degrading or lustful or violent full of obsession or love or hate or longing or disgust whether in prostitution a relationship or rape.A key context is emotions and degrees whether by the man or woman or mutual or drained of feeling such that I'm not sure love has any meaning in this film. There's a recurring use of Egon Schiele's erotic art to make some kind of comparative point about a continuum of sexual images and their effect on the viewer.The titular character is reminiscent of Quasimodo of The Hunchback of Notre Dame fixating on Esmeralda if he were a psychopathic pimp in I presume Seoul's lurid red light district and played by the charismatic Jaehyeon Jo like an apolitical Romper Stomper. I did get a little lost where he fit into the hierarchy of the yakuzalike gangster organization that controls the district how much authority he has and who was on top of whom to interpret their obsessions. Some of the encounters we see are presumably his limited fantasies as he miraculously recovers from various violently noble efforts to protect and reach out to the object of his affection that reminded me of the ambiguous ending of Jane Campion's The Piano. The film explores some of the same territory as the work of Catherine Breillat but the context seems uneasily different when I'm the only woman in the theater and the director is male perhaps because the central woman is always an object even as she pitifully adapts to her various degradations and even resists being freed from them. All the women in the film treat each other like the men treat them.".

	schema:headline " Bad guy is exquisite and Jaehyeon Jo's performance is hypnotic.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my top 10 favorite films. The film has a fair amount of violence and some uncomfortable scenes but you never feel that any scene is gratuitous. Each moment is part of the evolution of what it truly means to submit  to love  unconditionally. There is that moment in the film when the main actress finally allows herself to be led  astray. A moment that may be hard for some to accept. Some have called Bad Guy misogynistic. But I think Bad Guy is quite the opposite. You might as well call the film Breaking the waves misogynistic. Kim KiDuk understands that to show a female character realistically you must be prepared to show her in all her forms even the ones that we as women may be ashamed to admit to. What woman hasn't done something stupid and regretful for some man? How far are you willing to bend before you break to another's will for .... Love or just the possibility of love. The film Bad Guy is only a matter of degrees. You may think that as a woman you would never make the choices Sunhwa makes in the film. But I say Don't ever say never... because the first rule you will break will be your own... But their is a certain amount of culpability that is shared between Hanki and Sunhwa in the film. A demand to lead and a willingness to be led are all that are required. In the end this film is a love story. An unconditional love that requires you to love not in spite of your faults and weakness but because of them. Jaehyeon Jo's performance is one of the most mesmerizing every captured on celluloid. And almost done completely without dialog. Which I didn't notice until the 3rd time in a row when I had first watched the film. It doesn't hurt that he is super sexy and easy on the eyes too.  The film is further enhanced by an exquisite soundtrack. Etta Scollo's i tuoi fiori may have been selected by chance but you would never have noticed. The film's climax is like watching a hot pan of oil just before it falls off the edge of the stove. That timeless moment of indecision  when the move to rescue becomes more dangerous than doing nothing at all.".

She lost her backbone she spent more time sobbing and several inexplicable plot holes creep into the story. An unconvincing time distortion for want of better words works it's way into the story that I felt took away from the plot instead of adding depth to it. The writer may have been trying to be metaphorical but in the context of the rest of the film it was just out of place. And finally the central characters silence I believe hamstrings the movie unlike in a Kevin Smith movie where when Silent Bob speaks actually has something profound to say.By the end of the movie I could not care for either the girl or the main character and the ending neither seemed appropriate nor inappropriate for them. I simply didn't care for them... let alone despise them.".

His eyes tell as much about the way he is feeling as any words can. The raw human emotions are amazing. Watching Sunhwa go from the most innocent girl into the call girl that she becomes makes your heart break but then watching how she begins to feel about the Bad Guy at the end tempers this a little. And that ending with that traveling den of iniquity makes you feel both sorry for the two and at the same time you feel that these two people have found something that they have been looking for. Once again an Asian film maker ends a film realistically unlike American film makers who always go for the happy ending which would have ruined this story.

It reminds me of an old Italian movie I can't remember the name or actors because I've seen it when I was a kid with a mafia boss that falls in love with a woman kidnaps her but wants to charms her rather that rape her. This is also about a generally violent man who's attention is captured by a beautiful girl and he also wants access to her soul rather than her body.The movie is full of contrasts and paradoxes but what sets it apart is the atmosphere I had my heart pumping a good part of the movie without it being an action movie or anything and the subtle way it reveals the deep needs of every character.Its bad part though is that close to the end you keep expecting the movie to end and it doesn't. The slow pace of the movie doesn't help either so a feeling of is it over yet? can easily set in.I liked it I recommend it to people who have the mood to see a psychological Asian movie about gangsters prostitutes and the power of love.".

	schema:reviewBody "With the work of South Korean filmmaker Kim KiDuk the viewer has to accept some very fundamental flaws that inherently seem to be a part of his work in a practical sense. The production values are always cheap the soundtrack music is always tacky the acting is never more than at the most basic level there are continuity errors... in a word his films always seem low budget and as if everything were shot in one take. Also he has almost an insistence on breaching realism and lapsing into his own vague allegory. His characters never follow any kind of real internal logic but rather act according to the scenario he conceives. All of these factors amount to the reason I don't think I will ever be able to consider any of his films true masterpieces.That said in return for accepting these inherent flaws the viewer is rewarded with a candid unadulterated look into the creative mind of a very interesting person. Kim KiDuk's vision is relentlessly idiosyncratic but very consistent and pure. Watching his films you gain direct access into his thoughts. This is not filmmaking by committee this is auteurism in the truest sense. That in and of itself is such a rarity that his films are worth seeing for this reason alone. And this film Bad Guy is probably the purest most definitive example of Kim KiDuk's vision. All the preoccupations that manifest in his other work are here The mute inexpressive protagonist the seeming obsession with prostitution and the degradation of women in general and also the director's tendency to eventually lead his characters into an incomprehensible fantasy world. Whether or not the viewer is willing to accept these illogical flights of fancy is purely a matter of taste but personally i find his work fascinating solely because it is so stubbornly idiosyncratic and fueled by a remarkably pure sense of creative expression.".

Yet he's portrayed behind the lens of a camera and suddenly...He's simply misunderstood.".

It's sad to see a film like this get rated higher than a 3.1 for the only truth If the Male leads character depicted in the movie was in fact brought before the public in a real life scenario we'd gather our pitch forks and throw him to the jury yelling the sweet sounds of life imprisonment. Yet he's portrayed behind the lens of a camera and suddenly...He's simply misunderstood.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't watch a lot of newer more mainstream Asian films personally preferring 70s era pinku material or some of the newer extreme gore films  but I did enjoy BAD GUY on most levels. It's definitely different from some of the hyperkinetic action films or the scary little girl with long black hair type films that have overflowed the market recently. This film is a drama about love obsession and despair. Pretty strong stuff that is pulled off quite well  for the most part...I thug and a college girl have a heated exchange that leads to the guy obsessively following her. When he feels that he can't get to her any other way he sets her up to be caught stealing and she has to take a loan from some shady loan sharks to pay back the debt. Unable to do so  she is coerced into prostitution by a group that is run by the thug and his boys. She eventually finds out that he was behind her situation and obviously doesn't take to kindly to it  the rest of the film is pretty much a lovehate struggle between the two as well as with one of the other members of the gang who is in love with the hooker as well...There's quite a bit more going on in BAD GUY than the above summary  but I prefer to keep things kinda short. The transformation of the young woman from innocent collegestudent to streetwhore is sad and believable. The subjectmatter is handled seriously and competently and it's easy to relate to her pain and hopelessness. The main issue I had with the film was the fact that many things went unexplained and seemed that it was left to the audience to assume certain things that I felt could have been expanded on better. I don't know exactly how to explain this  you'll have to watch it and see for yourself. I also felt the ending was a bit anticlimactic and certain parts of the film felt kind of dull and redundant. Regardless BAD GUY is still a strong film if you're in the mood for a serious drama but want something different then the regular U.S. theatrical garbage that's out there...7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This film could probably not have been made in the US without severely damaging the reputation of the producer on the grounds of political incorrectness. Further my impression is that practically no reviewers recognize what is really going on here. It is about the psychological transformation of a very conservative and somewhat shy woman into what in the US we would hypocritically call a slut i.e. a woman who wants sex and is not averse to using it to make a living as only a woman can. The movie also highlights a key fact about female psychology nice guys come in last. Of course women universally deny this but it is nonetheless true. The only nice guy in the movie the woman's former boyfriend doesn't even get sex he just gets beaten up. Further the Bad Guy the guy who forces this woman into prostitution is in the end precisely the guy she chooses to be with! Sex which was initially foisted upon a woman who resisted ferociously effects a transformation. The woman who exists at the beginning of the movie is completely gone at the end and it is the kind of transformation that can happen only to a woman. The politically correct and highly Christianized society of the West especially in the US does not like to acknowledge that women have it in them to change in the manner depicted in the film. It is too threatening to their world view. And that is the greatness of this film it's honesty about men and women and an inyourface courage to face the truth. The story is not perfect but it is the only one I know of that has the courage to state the truth about these things and on the whole it's merits greatly outweigh it's flaws. See this movie if you want enlightenment but be prepared to have your boat rocked if you're the kind of person who prefers to live in a fantasy world of niceness and Christian piety.".

He shows us how they work how innocent young women get trapped by the business how a sense of helplessness descends upon the prostitutes and how painfully unwelcome and irrelevant their boyfriends their husbands their families become.To make a film with these themes central may not seem like a winning decision. However this is awardwinning director Kim's territory and he does with the subject matter what he will. No it's not pretty so don't expect it to be. No it doesn't end up with everything working out happily because life rarely does so don't expect that either. No there is no fine pat conclusion because Kim knows better.I noticed that this film contains bits of celluloid that was picked up off the cutting room floor after Kim's renowned 3Iron was made. Expect some unexpected scenes in this regard. Unfortunately the film is ugly from the beginning with an innocent young woman the magnificent actress and Kim favorite Seo Won taken into prostitution against her will through unlikely circumstance. She is not a willing prostitute and she rebels throughout the plot much to her dismay. But Kim is so adept at this. Ugliness becomes beautiful noise turns to stillness the guilty transform to innocence and the truly innocent remain so. I gasp at such awesome presentation. From Kim we expect this. Still he can overdo it. Why I ask does Kim always place a woman in mortal peril? Is this a must for his stories his fables? If so what is he trying to teach us? Certainly I hope more than the fact that sexploitation exists in his home country.Bad Guy is a beautiful movie but I only grant it 7 of 10 because Kim has apparently become obsessed with sexual violence reference The Isle Coast Guard and Address Unknown. Also there is just too much emphasis placed on predictable fight scenes. Sure such scenes can serve a purpose but by 2002 Kim should know he doesn't need to resort to the horrific presentations he makes them. I appreciate what he is trying to accomplish a counterpoint to his truly beautiful scenes. But do we really need to be hit over the head with sexual brutality again and again? Perhaps his own culture does and like what Mean Streets and Taxi Driver offered America in the 70's Kim is trying to do something similar for South Korean society in the 2000 oughts. We can but hope.Kim takes risks in showing the world the dark underbelly of contemporary Korean culture. He is to be commended for that. But he is capable of presenting so much more and that is precisely what this film lacks. Kim needs to stop using shock as his stock in trade and return to his more sublime talents such as presenting unlikely heroes and heroines. Most of his viewers are I am sure quite over blatant scenes of sex and violence. We get it Mr. Kim thank you offer us something more. We know you can. Make those scenes MEAN something. That is what made you attractive in the first place do not forget it.Quickly as an aside if anyone supposes simply because of the similarity of titles that Bad Guy is similar to Old Boy by Park Chan Wook forget it. These two films are nothing alike except that they are both good.This film is just good not great and should be received by Kim Ki Duk fans with mixed reactions.".

Britishborn producer Harry Alan Towers was still testing the waters as to how much sex and violence he could get away with at this pivotal moment in time for pictorial permissiveness which accounts for the restraint in the representation of both. His past successes with a string of profitable Fu Manchu flicks based on the Sax Rohmer potboilers gave him the commercial clout to attract a name cast of mostly hasbeens in desperate need of a paycheck supplemented with a slew of sexy starlets prepared to pull down their panties. First among equals in the latter department was Towers' lovely young bride Maria Rohm aka former Austrian stage actress Helga Grohmann who would shine most brightly in VENUS IN FURS and EUGENIE both made by Franco for her husband. Playing Marie the obligatory framed innocent she's predictably overshadowed by the unrepentant bad girls headed by the ravishing Rosalba Neri's cynical Zoe.Taken to a South American prison island actually Alicante where she's to be incarcerated in a magnificent fortress named El Castillo Della Muerte the Castle of Death for stabbing one of her rapists shown in superbly stylized flashback Marie or number 99 as she will now be referred to soon learns the ropes foolishly going up against head warden Thelma Diaz Mercedes McCambridge hamming her way out of a midcareer slump when another new arrival exBond girl Luciana Paluzzi goes into cold turkey jitters. Like any other act of rebellion this immediately lands her in solitary. An impromptu cat fight with dyed in the wool dyke Neri on account of her harassing Marie's friend Helga Elisa Monts from Mel Welles' ISLAND OF THE DOOMED risks making her a permanent resident there were it not for the unexpected appearance of social worker Leonie Carroll revered German actress Maria Schell come to inspect the prison's conditions following a number of recent deaths. This doesn't sit well with Thelma who not altogether wrongly suspects the intruder has come to take her place so she calls on the help of corrupt Governor Santos a stoic Herbert Lom whom she regularly supplies with inmates for intimacy.Ticking off all the boxes nudity check ! whippings check ! lesbian comforting check ! the plot moves along as cheerfully as the grim proceedings will allow with hilariously hardboiled dialog to keep fans grinning. McCambridge spits 'n growls her way through another turn for Towers and Franco that makes the one she gave in their JUSTINE look positively demure by comparison. Her once flourishing career might have gone down the drain but she was sure to kick up a stink. Half the fun's in watching her costars' perplexed looks on their faces as they attempt to keep from being blown off the screen by this one woman whirlwind.By contrast Schell seems all too aware she's slumming it content to simper sympathetically and deliver the flattest line readings imaginable. Apart from Rohm and Neri whose exploitation career would kick off in earnest with Ferdinando Di Leo's 1971 SLAUGHTER HOTEL none of the toppopping floozies register very strongly certainly not Paluzzi who  regardless of prominent billing  expires ten minutes into the movie and doesn't bare squat. A few years later she would go proudly topless in Nello Rossati's entertaining THE SENSUOUS NURSE. Shortbobbed Brazilian bombshell Valentina Godoy from Franco's THE GIRL FROM RIO makes the most of the unfortunate Rosalie cruelly ambushed during the botched prison break.In light of the excesses this exploitation subgenre was about to engender 99 WOMEN appears almost innocent in its beat around the bush coyness. This approach forces Franco into ingenuity when it comes to boobs 'n beatings displaying both with far more style than was his habit. Case in point being Rohm and Neri's then daring samesex dalliance spectacularly shot in a series of dissolves and closeups of nonvital body parts by Franco regular Manuel Merino who also photographed his COUNT Dracula who achieves the scene's erotic effect through sheer suggestion. Bruno Nicolai's haunting theme song The Day I Was Born warbled by the incomparable Barbara McNair which suggests this was a recorded but unused track from VENUS IN FURS appears in a number of starkly varying arrangements going from a jubilatory gospel rendition to a softly murmured version with minimal orchestration.".

The lead girl played by the lovely Maria Schell may or may not be innocent regardless she decides she does not wish to remain in the inhospitable place any longer than she has to and an escape attempt forms.As would be expected the prison is host to assorted debauchery and sadism on the part of the prison staff. Prisoners are mistreated dehumanized etc. Compared to most any other WIP flick out there this one is pretty clean content wise. Some clothed cat fights limited nudity and one harsh though thankfully brief rape scene are the most the film offers in terms of exploitation.Technically speaking I would argue that this is Franco's most accomplished film. Light color sound are all good even his use of camera angles exceeds what would normally be expected of him. The acting is all around what would be expected from this sort of affair with the notable exception of Herbert Lom who manages to be both a creep and oddly likable. A major down point is the script which is so cutndry that it never does a whole lot of anything.An actually good Franco movie that may be too tame for his more fetish fans but certainly worth a look.Note This review is based on the regular edition of the film and not the badly reedited hardcore version 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah womeninprison and Jesus Franco. What can we expect.It really depends on the version you watch as there are versions from 70 minutes UK to 99 minutes Argentina. The US and Sweden have 86 minute versions although Sweden banned even that. This is a 90 minute unrated version.One does not expect to find a double Golden Globe and Oscar winner in a Jesus Franco film but here she is  Mercedes McCambridge All the King's Men  1949 as the prison superintendent.Also Maria Schell who has 2 BAFTA Film Award nominations and another 14 awards as an inspector from the Ministry. She did get prisoner 99 Maria Rohm out of solitary on her first day.More expected is Herbert Lom as the Governor the only surviving member of The Ladykillers 1955 and a Razzie nominee for King Solomon's Mines.It appears Franco was going for quality as it is more than a half hour in before we see a breast and some girlongirl action. Even that was shot with a lot of Vaseline on the camera. Don't the women in this prison take showers? Marie 99 Zoe Rosalba Neri and Rosalie Valentina Godoy attempt to cross 30 miles of snakeinfested jungle and swamp at night to escape. yeah right. They find a lilycovered pond that looks the same as the one in Virgin among the Living Dead.Of course it isn't the snakes on the ground they have to worry about but the snakes attached to the dozen male prisoners that saw them and are running after them. One doesn't make it.A good drama with some famous actors but disappointing as a WIP exploitations.".

	onyx:emotionText "Ah womeninprison and Jesus Franco. What can we expect.It really depends on the version you watch as there are versions from 70 minutes UK to 99 minutes Argentina. The US and Sweden have 86 minute versions although Sweden banned even that. This is a 90 minute unrated version.One does not expect to find a double Golden Globe and Oscar winner in a Jesus Franco film but here she is  Mercedes McCambridge All the King's Men  1949 as the prison superintendent.Also Maria Schell who has 2 BAFTA Film Award nominations and another 14 awards as an inspector from the Ministry. She did get prisoner 99 Maria Rohm out of solitary on her first day.More expected is Herbert Lom as the Governor the only surviving member of The Ladykillers 1955 and a Razzie nominee for King Solomon's Mines.It appears Franco was going for quality as it is more than a half hour in before we see a breast and some girlongirl action. Even that was shot with a lot of Vaseline on the camera. Don't the women in this prison take showers? Marie 99 Zoe Rosalba Neri and Rosalie Valentina Godoy attempt to cross 30 miles of snakeinfested jungle and swamp at night to escape. yeah right. They find a lilycovered pond that looks the same as the one in Virgin among the Living Dead.Of course it isn't the snakes on the ground they have to worry about but the snakes attached to the dozen male prisoners that saw them and are running after them. One doesn't make it.A good drama with some famous actors but disappointing as a WIP exploitations.";

	schema:headline " Surprisingly Tasteful";
	schema:reviewBody "Jesus Franco is one of the few directors in the world who could take a muchmaligned genre like the womeninprison film and make it even sleazier. BarbWire Dolls would have been unwatchably repugnant were it not so inept and Ilsa the Wicked Warden WAS unwatchably repugnant despite being equally inept. For that reason I approached this movie with great trepidation but was surprised to find it relatively wellmade and surprisingly tasteful. The plot is pretty standard. Girls are imprisoned on islandthey give them a number and take away their names. Since this was made in the more censorial 60's there is no graphic torture and no showers and the prisoners actually get to wear underwear beneath their prison smocks. Mercedes McCambridge is the harsh warden. Herbert Lom is the corrupt commander of the island who takes sexual liberties with the prisoners. Maria Schell is the wellintentioned but ineffective reformer. Luciana Paluzzi is the topbilled convict but she exits quickly and the real stars are Maria Rohm and Rosalba Neri who together lead the big bust out at the end.Relatively speaking this movie had a decent budget and a talented cast and perhaps because of this and the aforementioned threat of censorshipFranco had to reign himself in from his usual indulges. I can just imagine the conversations he would have had with these relatively classy actresses No Jesus I'm NOT going to perform analingus on her masticated rectum I was a Bond girl for christsakes!. Not that there isn't any sex or nudity. There is a great catfightlesbian sex scene between Neri and Rohm as the lascivious Lom looks on but the action is shot almost entirely in a montage of extreme closeups the only time after this that Franco was this circumspect in a sex scene was in Erotismo and that was no doubt because he was trying to avoid child porn charges after stupidly casting an underage actress. My favorite scene though is a flashback sequence where Neri does a sexy strip to a flickering candelabra and in a touch that is both perverse and surreal her audience is a bunch of cigarettesmoking schoolgirls! Of course there are those Franco aficionados out there who would prefer endless static shots of Lina Romay or somebody rolling around naked on a bed while Franco conducts a gynecological exam with his zoom lens to these much more sedate sex scenes but there can be little doubt which is more classy and tasteful.The best part though might be the catchy theme song Born to Be Bad that leaves you with a warm feeling of nostalgia for that era whether you experienced it or not. I don't know if I'd want to watch this movie again but at least I didn't feel like running for the shower when it was over. If you want to see a Franco a WIP flick this is a good place to start and also to stop.".

	schema:reviewBody "Does the world really need all these 'Women in Prison' flicks? The legendary director Jess Franco apparently seemed to think so because almost half of the titles that fall under this category are his. There's also a lot of variation in this questionable sub genre of cultcinema  largely determined by how old they are  as most of them are really nasty and exploitative whereas some the pioneers mainly are more sensual and emphasizing on the dramaelements. 99 Women at least the original nonhardcore version got released during the earliest stage of W.I.P madness and thus Franco was still clearly 'exploring' how far he could go with inserting lesbian sleaze and brutal whippings. The later ones are a nonstop series of tasteless sex and raw violence but this film actually has a remotely decent script and an aboveaverage amount of stylish elements. A small island in the Pacific Ocean serves as a gigantic prison with a fort for women in one corner and one for men in the other. Female prisoners n 97 98 and 99 arrive one morning by boat and they immediately meet the sadistic head warden Thelma and the sleazy Governor Santos. The girls are punished and put in isolation cells for no reason and lethal 'accidents' appear to be a regular routine. Just because so many prisoners die the government sends a new female principal to the island. She makes efforts to befriend the prisoners particularly the beautiful  innocent Marie but the wicked old headmistress constantly boycotts her. 99 Women isn't the most exciting movie ever as many sequences are dreadfully slow and pointless and there's a serious lack of continuity. The locations are very nice looking and the photography is occasionally even elegant but sadly it's all just an empty package. If you don't purchase the Xrated version you won't have much sleazy goodness to admire. 99 Women is incredibly tame with only a couple of scarcely dressed women catfighting and some lesbian experimenting. The cast is really good though with the ravishing regular Franconymphs Maria Rohm The Bloody Judge Eugenie and Rosalba Neri Amuck! Lady Frankenstein playing likable characters. Herbet Lom is awesome as the fiendish nudityobsessed can you blame him? governor. Mainly just recommended to Francophiles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Welcome to hell. The prison is nicknamed Casa de la muertezCastle of Deathand is ran with an iron fist to the chops by superintendent ThelmaMercedes Mcambridge . We are introduced to three young women who are being boated to this godforsaken place sentenced to a female prison built by Spaniards overlooking an ocean seemingly cut off from civilization. McCambridge is wonderfully lecherous as the strict disciplinarian whose abuse has trouble brewing due to a couple murders thanks to the harsh acts of those in charge. The prison itself looks as if it were cut out of stone cells with cavernous walls voices echoing when those within even speak in a normal tone. The salacious Spanish governor with a doghead cane Herbert Lom is always granted permission to have his way with the girls. During Franco's era with Harry Allan Towers he made some pretty successful pictures with the British producer's wife Maria RohmVenus in Furs. 99 Women has Rohm as a sniveling weakling Leonie who is pushed around by the luscious ZoieRosalba Neri with a pair of magnificent legs quite open about her sexual desire for the new inmate. For a fan of lesbian erotica I must say that I was more than a bit disappointed in the NeriRohm sequence as Franco's camera remains out of focus and never centered properly on the action..this is especially disconcerting when you have two such lovely creatures making love to each other. I could nit pick about how even when Rohm supposedly suffers in the punishment cell for repeated insolence she looks like a million bucks only her hair a little out of sorts. I don't mind such things because womeninprison flicks rarely depict such scenarios involving female inmates persecuted in the harshest ways with it showing in a realistic manner. A welfare worker Ms CarolMaria Schell given star treatment may be the only hope for the inmates under Thelma for she is appointed to see that they are treated with a reasonable care. But despite her good will Carol finds the task of helping the inmates difficult because they don't trust that she can make a difference.The movie establishes later that Rohm was possibly falsely accused of prostituting herself before being charged with murder when she claims to have merely defended herself against those who were trying to rape her. Staples of the genre are present such as catfights and a planned prison escape. Inmates are recognized by their assigned numbers not by name..there's a great scene where McCambridge slaps a new inmate for saying her name when asked not her new name Number 98. I had always read and heard that Towers was a pennypinching cheap producer constantly balking about having to spend money but Franco's movies in that partnership looked decently budgeted..at least he had a better camera and his movie looked to have had good production value. Interesting enough there is a protracted jungle escape which takes up the latter portion of the movie detracting from the storyline regarding Carol and her troubles with the governor and Thelma..it worked for me because as HelgaElisa Monts and Marie are on the cusp of freedom after surviving a hot sweaty jungle and all it's many dangersincluding male prisoners longing to rape them we see that escape from their situation is pretty much hopeless. Carol's honorable intentions fall to the wayside and the denouement presents the fact that behind the walls of a cruel prison system humanity seems not to exist. I have a hard time not enjoying Franco's seductive camera capturing the ravishing bodies of his scantily clad ladies in nothing more than prison shirts and panties..color me an easy guy to please. I was impressed with Franco not going overboard with the zoom lens although I like the use of the technique when you have interesting faces in frame. I really dug this cast.".

Carol's honorable intentions fall to the wayside and the denouement presents the fact that behind the walls of a cruel prison system humanity seems not to exist. I have a hard time not enjoying Franco's seductive camera capturing the ravishing bodies of his scantily clad ladies in nothing more than prison shirts and panties..color me an easy guy to please. I was impressed with Franco not going overboard with the zoom lens although I like the use of the technique when you have interesting faces in frame. I really dug this cast.";

Lets take the abomination that is 99 Women as an example at almost an hour  forty minutes this feels twice as long  for a film where virtually nothing happens 99 Women is slow going  I was throughly bored by it. Hell I started to play some games on my phone about an hour in I was so bored. The story is crap the dialogue is awful  the character's are cardboard thin. As an early example of the Women in Prison genre 99 Women really doesn't hold up the location used looks more like a vineyard there's no shower scene  little in the way of genuine sleaze. The script tries it's hand at a bit of drama with the plight of the abused women  the most dull prison escape ever filmed. People just don't act like people people don't talk like people  there's not enough sleaze here to make this watchable another worthless piece of crap from Franco who has his admirers  fans but for the life of me I can't see why.The whole look of 99 Women is dull some of the locations are nice but do not look anything like a prison  the way the women wear shirts but not much else means I never got the Women in Prison vibe from this at all. Surprisingly light on nudity  sex there's not a great deal of violence either although Franco manages to include a scene where a woman attacks  stabs a Snake despite it just laying on the floor doing noone any harm it would have been quicker  easier  safer is the woman had just stepped over it or walked around it you know? To be honest I can't really remember much about this it just sort of went in one ear  straight out the other if you know what I mean with no impact on me at all. The mythical French version includes hardcore sex scenes featuring people not in the rest of the film having sex in places not in the rest of the film.Apparently filmed in Valencia in Spain this cheap film features lots of ugly zooms  really boring shots that Franco holds for ages the editing is also bad with character's jumping around all over the place with the final riot at the end the best or worst example of this. The women here really aren't that good looking although a couple are attractive enough I suppose Herbert Lom deserved better than this.99 Women is more crap from cult director Franco but this time there isn't even any sleaze or violence to make it bearable unless you watch the badly edited French hardcore version  is yet another film by Franco that I can honestly say I hated. The sort of film that makes me want to give up watching films altogether.".

This is not really a benefit or a hindrance however as 99 Women is just as boring as most of these films anyway. The plot is just your usual women in prison theme  bunch of girls in jail trying to escape from the awful prison guards etc. It's a shame that this is just another entry in an overpopulated genre too as the film features a good cult cast  Rosalba Neri is one of my very favourite actresses and the film also features the likes of Maria Schell and Maria Rohm as well as the great Herbert Lom but the cast considered this is still a rubbish film and I wont be recommending it!".

Franco seems to have gone for the mainstream cinema with attention to the new warden the attempts to get rid of her and the escape of three inmates which all goes horribly wrong.There is a socalled notorious French edition which includes some hard core action but these clips have been clumsily spliced in.

Apparently not me as I was quite excited about my purchase of this movie. It was pretty horrible as expected but not in a good way. I was hoping this was going to be one of those hilarious womeninprison exploitation flicks that were high in camp value. Hell Mercedes McCambridge is in it! First off the movie started off positively. We have three broads arriving on a boat still in the clothes they were apparently arrested in tried in Court and then literally sent up the river in! We are introduced to the blonde starlet Marie the blackhaired stripper Helga and some other brunette who dies from some sort of accident that required medical surgery.The camp factor needle hits HIGH as soon as we are introduced to Mercedes McCambridge appearing in a warden's uniform barking orders in a fauxGerman accent even though her name is Thelma Diaz and giving Marie a backhand across the face for using her name instead of her number 99.However it only gets worse from here. While there are certainly some entertaining catfight scenes ie hairpulling clothes being ripped off face slapping etc the rest of the film is incredibly boring. There is a sadistic male warden Herbert Lom who coerces one of the female prisoners into seducing Marie for his pleasure and there is one unnamed prison guard who has the most hilarious facial expressions when introducing guests to McCambridge but the rest of the film falls flat.Maria Schell is not in the film nearly enough and when she is it's hard to determine what her true agenda is. It seems like she has a thing for Marie but they never explore it.When the girls finally break out and trek through a jungle there are a few more camp moments such as the scene with the harmless snake where upon spotting it and instead of running around it the girls proceed to scream grab it and cut it with a knife LOL. The other semiamusing moment was watching Marie and Helga make a dash for the fishing boats handinhand and wearing nothing short of seethrough panties and torn jumpsuits.Mercedes McCambridge was the movie's only saving grace. Her accent borderlined German and Spanish and she had some pretty hilarious oneliners such as She was put in the punishment cell... for repeated insolences! At various moments her voice deepened into that same voice she used as Pazuzu in The Exorcist I thought maybe she was going to morph into Satan at any moment.The most interesting thing that I heard about this movie was that there is an Xrated version out there. I watched the unrated version which had no explicit sex scenes only some gratuitous breast shots and a glimpse of bush. I shudder at the thought that Mercedes McCambridge might have filmed a scene not knowing that at some later point her body double would be enjoying an explicit lesbian sex scene with one of the female prisoners.I would not recommend this movie to any womeninprison enthusiasts out there. In fact I would only recommend this movie to Mercedes McCambridge fans as she is the sole reason I gave this movie one star. Don't waste your time with this one folks.".

After World World II the film industry lay down in Germany. The good directors were either dead or in the US successors were not in sight. The people was lacking even its basics.

McCambridge is some harpy bitch with a screw loose and a bad accent she wants to be Eva to Herb's Adolf. Then poor Maria wandering around lost like someone slipped a Mickey Finn in her cuppa and she has no idea what film she is in. The three of them must have been so proud and had annual reunions to rejoice at what a fun time they had on the shoot.The plot basically is girls in prison are abused and used by a sadistic regime that's meant to reform. There are catfights some flesh an escape that is used purely to introduce some blokes from the men's prison on the other side of the island and of course rape torture lesbianism desperation and some sand! All tastefully filmed...of course. Woeful film and woeful film making but it still gave me one of the biggest laughs of the year and that porn movie jazz is half decent! 210".

At one time this was also true of the smaller number of films about women in prison the American Caged and the British Yield to the Night are wellknown examples from the fifties. The late sixties however saw the birth of a new genre the women in prison exploitation film. Jess Franco's99 Women is an early example of the type. Films like this were made as entertainment catering for male sexual fantasies rather as serious drama about crime and punishment but in their early days they were not explicitly pornographic. Even in the swinging sixties there was a limit to what the censors would permit. A film on this subject made ten or perhaps even only five years after this one would doubtless have been considerably more sexually explicit. We know that 99 Women will turn out to be an exploitation film as soon as we see that the inmates of this particular jail all 99 of them are young andattractive and that the prison uniform consists of little more than a very short minidress. The actual plot storyline does not matter too much it includes the punishment and humiliation of the women by a cruel female warder the attempts of a relatively liberal new governor to reform conditions and a jail break but the filmfeatures several recurrent clichs of the women in prison genre. These include catfights between prisoners and physical abuse of the prisoners bysadistic guards. There are however no real sex scenes andno full nudity. Those minidresses may get ripped but the girls' underwear always stays intact. Any lesbianism remains implied rather than explicit. 99 Women was a boxoffice success when it first appeared in 1969 but by the standards of anyone other than the titillationhungry young men of the late sixties it is a very poor film indeed with a hackneyed plot a villainously written script and generally low standards of acting. The film was originally shot in French and dubbed into English but in the version I saw the dubbing had for some reason been omitted from several scenes which remained in the original language without subtitles. In most of Franco's films the cast is made up of long forgotten porn stars but this one features several wellknown names not only the former Bond Girl Luciana Paluzzi but also actors as distinguished as Herbert Lom and the onetime Oscarwinning Mercedes McCambridge neither ofwhom can be said to have enhanced their reputation by appearing in it. The film is today of no more than historic interest except perhaps tothose who subscribe to the idea that Franco was some great cult director. To my way of thinking he had more talent for arousing controversy than he did for actually making films and the only cult that grew up around him consisted solely of those attracted to his brand of softcore erotica. 310".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched the film with my mother who lived through the coup d'etat in Chile. The events depicted in the movie were so realistic they transported her back to that era. She cried as we watched and explained all of the small details I wouldn't have gotten being someone who didn't experience these events for myself. With this in mind I have to think this movie was meant to be watched by a Chilean audience to be fully understood and felt. Someone like my mother who has seen the atrocities that occurred in Chile in the midseventies would be a more appropriate critic of this film.Regardless I think everyone should watch this movie. It is a touching story about friendship growing up social classes and politics. The acting was exceptional. The plot was well written. The sets props and costumes were accurate. It has a lot to offer as an enlightening and educational film since the story of Chile's own 911 has not yet reached the general masses. Because the story is told through a sentimental child's perspective you are drawn yet closer to the characters and their emotions. Some have criticized this film harshly stating that Wood couldn't make up his mind whether this film is a political story or a child's comingofage tale. Why can't it be both? As a Chilean I am extremely proud of this film in its quality and accuracy. It is powerful bold and touched me to my very core. I strongly recommend it to all especially all of you ChileanAmericans born during this era. Ask your parents to tell you their own story and you will see that Machuca is more than a piece of cinematic brilliance and a milestone in Chilean film. It is a film you will never forget.".

	onyx:emotionText "I watched the film with my mother who lived through the coup d'etat in Chile. The events depicted in the movie were so realistic they transported her back to that era. She cried as we watched and explained all of the small details I wouldn't have gotten being someone who didn't experience these events for myself. With this in mind I have to think this movie was meant to be watched by a Chilean audience to be fully understood and felt. Someone like my mother who has seen the atrocities that occurred in Chile in the midseventies would be a more appropriate critic of this film.Regardless I think everyone should watch this movie. It is a touching story about friendship growing up social classes and politics. The acting was exceptional. The plot was well written. The sets props and costumes were accurate. It has a lot to offer as an enlightening and educational film since the story of Chile's own 911 has not yet reached the general masses. Because the story is told through a sentimental child's perspective you are drawn yet closer to the characters and their emotions. Some have criticized this film harshly stating that Wood couldn't make up his mind whether this film is a political story or a child's comingofage tale. Why can't it be both? As a Chilean I am extremely proud of this film in its quality and accuracy. It is powerful bold and touched me to my very core. I strongly recommend it to all especially all of you ChileanAmericans born during this era. Ask your parents to tell you their own story and you will see that Machuca is more than a piece of cinematic brilliance and a milestone in Chilean film. It is a film you will never forget.";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1973 the Chilean military under the direction of General Augusto Pinochet and backed by the CIA overthrew the shaky socialist government of democratically elected President Salvador Allende. The coup led to the murder of 3000 leftist Allende supporters and the detention of an estimated 250000 political prisoners. Set against the background of the political instability that led to the crisis Andrs Woods' Machuca is the moving story of the friendship between two boys from different sides of the social spectrum. Voted the most popular film at the 2004 Vancouver Film Festival and a major boxoffice hit in Chile the semiautobiographical film succeeds on both a human and a political level the different elements coming together in a final conflagration.Gonzalo Infante Matias Quer is a chubby redfaced 11year old who attends St. Patrick's private school. He lives in a wealthy neighborhood where his security is unquestioned even though he knows that his mother Maria Aline Kuppenheim is having a longstanding affair with a welltodo Argentine businessman. Gonzalo is shy and inexpressive and is often bullied at school. His life changes however when Father McEnroe Ernesto Malbran the priest who runs the school opens St. Patrick's to those who are unable to pay and Gonzalo develops a friendship with Pedro Machuca Ariel Mataluna a youngster who lives in a nearby shantytown. The inclusion of the marginal students causes unrest at the school. Fights break out between the two economic classes and parents hastily call meetings to voice their opposition to the communist priest. Gonzalo protects Pedro from the bullies and later visits Pedro in his home.Aware of how much he has Gonzalo accepts his status without feeling superior though Pedro's family refers to him as the snob. In a subplot Pedro's seductive young cousin Silvana Manuela Martelli gives both boys an introduction to sexual pleasure. Though the relationship between the two boys develops naturally and their innocence allows them to see past the developing turmoil the disturbing layers of adult events slowly begin to threaten their friendship. To pick up some extra money the boys attend political rallies and sell Chilean flags to both the Nationalists and the Communists but soon emotions escalate and street fights break out between farleft and farright militants. The onset of revolt is signaled by the arrival of two jets flying towards the Presidential Palace a seminal event in Chile's history that marked the end of their democracy.One of Chile's most successful young filmmakers Woods lets the facts speak for themselves and Machuca makes its points with an emotional power unencumbered by bias or simplistic messages. While the upper middle class is shown as elitist and disdainful of the working class Pedro's family is also not portrayed in glowing terms. In a drunken rage of victimization the father tells his son that in a few years He Gonzalo will be working for Daddy....You'll be cleaning toilets. The children are portrayed as simply children without the false glow of largerthanlife heroism. Although Machuca may ultimately have more of an impact for Chileans who experienced the coup directly its theme of young people caught in the swirl of events beyond their understanding resonates far beyond the details of this single tragic moment in history.".

The movie is apolitical in the way the main characters are children so the focus is everyday life more than taking an actual view.

The bourgeois boy Gonzalo Infante Matas Quer and the boy from the slum Pedro Machuca Ariel Mateluna become great friends while the conflicts on the streets leads Chile to the bloody and repressive military coup of General Augusto Pinochet on 11 September 1973 changing definitely their lives their relationship and their country.Machuca is a touching and realistic tale of friendship and coming to age in times of military coup in Chile. The Chilean director Andrs Wood made this fantastic movie following the political genre of Costa Gravas but with a subtle drama with two children getting conscience of the fight of classes and the changes in their country by force and violence. The story in some moments seems to be a documentary so perfect the direction and acting are. The debut of the two lead actors Matas Quer and Ariel Mateluna is awesome the eyes of the silent Matas Quer disclosing reality and the facial expression of Ariel Mateluna are amazing. Machuca is a highly recommended movie and for the younger generations slightly see what happened in the 70's in South America and particularly in Chile. A few figures about Pinochet's dictatorship 30000 Chileans were killed 100000 Chileans were arrested without a trial 22000 students were expelled from the universities 150000 Chileans were exiled. My vote is ten.Title Brazil Machuca".

Like Diaros de Motocicleta the recent film about a young Ernesto Guevara this is NOT simply a political diatribe. It does not romanticize the Allende government or the difficulties riots shortages etc.that the country went through during his turbulent reign. It certainly doesn't paint the Pinochet coup in a very favorable light but I don't see how you can make the overthrow of a democraticallyelected government and the murder torture and disappearance of some 3000 people look like a wonderful thing. The film portrays many Pinochet supporters either as rich and corrupt or as smallminded reactionary bullies which is not entirely inaccurate but it certainly doesn't shy away from the dark side of the Allende revolution Allende supporters are shown accosting middleclass Chileans in the street Allende himself appears in actual TV footage of his notorious meeting with Soviet leader Leonid Breshnev. Really though it would be a shame if continuing political differences stop people from seeing this superb film which really transcends politics to capture the spirit of youth and a time that as terrible as it was will never be forgotten.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must start with saying that this is probably one of the best movies of the year if not of all times. It s set in the revolution days in Chille when the Facists came to power. The story is about a rich boy who studies in a rich school when the principle decides to bring in poor students for free. Of course the rich kids and their parents doesn't like it but it's not like the poor kids can't stand out for themselves... The rich kid is making friends with a poor kid Machuca and they enjoy life together while everything falls apart around them. And there is a very powerful end which I won't reveal but you'll see it coming if you know history.The first thing that I've noticed is the cinematography. You know how American movies are always aiming for a perfect clean picture. Well I don't like that style and that is why I liked the cinematography in Machuca so much. The picture is a little dark and looks to be old. It gives the movie that is set in the 70's a real 70's feeling. It's very nice even if the story gets a little boring for a second nah the movie was great at every time the picture still makes it nice to watch.The second thing that I've noticed is that while the movie is played mainly by kids they actually hold the movie very well. It's a very convincing acting almost flawless. But the rest of the cast is very good too the mother the principle I enjoyed the acting of all of them. Also to complete a great picture there is a great soundtrack. And when I say great I mean GREAT! The music is so vivid and placed well. It will take a while to get it out of my head. Oh and another thing. I'm still only learning to appreciate a good editing it's not a trivial thing at all but this movie seems to get it all right. Every scene is on place and ends when needed there are no useless scenes and there is no feeling that something is missing. I think that it's perfect editing in the sense that they can't edit that movie any better.So all in all very very recommended! It's available on DVD for now but it should be released in a month or so in the theaters but it will be a very limited release.".

Every scene is on place and ends when needed there are no useless scenes and there is no feeling that something is missing. I think that it's perfect editing in the sense that they can't edit that movie any better.So all in all very very recommended! It's available on DVD for now but it should be released in a month or so in the theaters but it will be a very limited release.";

In a way this movie describes how this story of pain began and was developing until a horrible finale. It's not a movie about a dictatorship by a junta or Allende or Pinochet or a coup whatsoever. It's about hate. An invisible enemy that was destroying an entire country produced mostly by foreign economic interests. All seen through the eyes of two 11 years old kids who become friends in spite of their opposite social status.When I was a child 5 years old or so I thought that was not proper to be talking about certain things. That every country had one president elected for life and that all communist people were terrorists ordered by a superior chief to destroy peace etcetera. Obviously if you were born in a fascist world things may appear a little mixed up when you start growing up and begin to understand that a lot of people who protect you are just thieves of power who think square and don't understand basic concepts such as human rights or tolerance.So I felt a little bit of healthy envy when I saw the main characters of this film because despite all of the political and social chaos that surround them they know the world as it was. They were born in democracy but they didn't took it for granted perhaps they didn't even care. They lived their innocence they discovered the power of friendship until everything was destroyed.That point of the film is unbearable.Machuca is a very good motion picture. Not in an epic way but in a very humble insight of what happened in a little country that lost its innocence becoming a divided nation.Andrs Wood the director was a child in 1973. A tagline of the movie says dedicated to the children of yesterday. So the film is the vision of part of the filmmaker's own life. I think a very accurate one.910".

	schema:headline " Two schoolboys from different backgrounds live through the transition from Allende to Pinochet";
	schema:reviewBody "Our film is shot in Santiago Chile and follows two schoolboys shortly before the 1973 military coup. Gonzalo Infante is the son of a wealthy upper middle class family and goes to a good school. His parents are outraged that children from the poor shanty towns are being introduced to the school and encouraged to mix with their children. Among the shanty town dwellers is the young Pedro Machuca. He and Gonzalo form an increasing bond of friendship as they grow into adolescence. But the gulf between their backgrounds is a powerful one.The film has been hailed as the most successful Chilean film ever. Made on an apparently tiny budget with help from the UK and Spain it is anything but small budget in appearance money from the industrialised European countries goes a long way in Chile! The story is engaging throughout and for the Westerner the glimpses into the political history are a window onto a different world.As there are so many myths surrounding both Allende and Pinochet I've added a short synopsis that might help as background and with respect to Chilean scholars  I am no expert in the field  this sort of information can be gleaned from Amnesty International recently released USA documents and scholarly sources.Allende was popularly elected to implement an 'antiimperialist' program of building socialism within a democratic and constitutional framework in November of 1970. Chile at this time was in the depths of an economic crisis and like many Latin American countries had had much of its natural wealth and even ability to manage its own affairs taken by foreign investors legally and illegally. The lifestyle of the wealthy upper classes contrasted to the poverty of people in the shanty towns but the educated elite held considerable power. Bent on creating economic chaos opponents of the new government began deliberately to exacerbate these difficult conditions the political set off a large exodus of capital a cessation of private investment and an extensive withdrawal of bank deposits. nationalizations of American and other foreignowned companies had sharply increased tensions with the United States which gave the Nixon administration sufficient excuse to orchestrate an international financial blockade restricting economic credit to Chile. Simultaneously C.I.A subsidies were flowing to rightwing media politicians and organizations to assist a campaign of domestic destabilization.Allende committed suicide in the final stages of the CIAbacked military coup led by Pinochet. The United States had ran covert actions in Chile between 1963 and 1973 leading to the ascension of General Pinochet. The US Government's official report of the operations said it epitomized CIA covert actions worldwide. However brutal the Pinochet government it was 'good' for US interests. Thus began 17 years of dictatorship which ended March 11 1990. According to Amnesty International and the United Nations' Human Rights Committee 250000 Chileans had been detained for political reasons by the end of 1973. In 1990 having failed in his bid to gain popular ratification for his rule Pinochet handed over the presidency to the rightfully elected Patricio Aylwin Azocar. Chile now has a market economy and the political climate has since remained stable although there is still considerable tension between the military and the government concerning human rights violations of the Pinochet era. Pinochet still retains a considerable group of supporters both inside and outside the country and the myths and stereotypes he generated still haunt the political future of Latin America. Some still vividly remember the social anarchy hyperinflation expropriation land invasions and violent confrontations under the socialist policies of Allende. The more important reason however is Chile's economic performance. Without the direct and intentional destabilising influence and with opponents or poor people simply exterminated the economy improved. In the weeks that followed the coup thousands of unionists socialists students and leftwing activists were raped tortured starved and murdered. extermination of thousands of civilians in South America but the remaining elite were protected and international relations 'normalised'. As Gonzalo's father says in the film 'Socialism is good for Chile ... it's just not good for us.'".

It is a tale of a friendship across class and political boundaries and it is told through the observant eyes of children. Political social and class taboos are covered in a sympathetic and innocent way and are illustrated by the filming of stunning views of Chile. The main characters in the film may be seen and not heard but they are definitely all seeing and it all culminates in a shocking climax to the film.

	onyx:emotionText "Machuca gives you a glimpse of an era a snapshot of a piece of Latin American history that is so complex many people do not dare broach the subject. It is a tale of a friendship across class and political boundaries and it is told through the observant eyes of children. Political social and class taboos are covered in a sympathetic and innocent way and are illustrated by the filming of stunning views of Chile. The main characters in the film may be seen and not heard but they are definitely all seeing and it all culminates in a shocking climax to the film. The only negative comment I heard as I was leaving the cinema was It was amazing but its only the story of a split second of events...there were so much more pain and so many more victims.";

Knowing that there remains a divided opinion of this period of time a time when Allende supporters who could not escape the country were murdered or placed in detention camps as political prisoners Woods sensitively recreates this period through the eyes of children from the populace divided by the middle class and the poor a technique which works on every level.Saint Patrick's School for boys in Santiago is headed by a kind priestprincipal Father McEnroe Ernesto Malbran and the rich to middle class uniformed boys include one 'strawberry faced' quiet chubby Gonzalo Infante Matas Quer whose family is of means but has issues of covert infidelity with the mother Aline Kppenheim and father Francisco Reyes. The Allende government is shaky and in an attempt to appease the poor class Saint Patrick's School takes on students from the shantytowns to 'democratize' education. Among these new students is Pedro Machuca Ariel Mateluna who seems to be a loner but soon becomes the brunt of the rich kids' prejudice. Gonzalo befriends Pedro and gradually the two form a strong bond which leads to each of the boys learning about their separate families and life styles Gonzalo's life of luxury dazzles Pedro while Pedro's humble shack houses warm family that Gonzalo envies. The friendship leads to a close examination of the schism of racism and political clashes brought into sharp focus as the military coup changes everything. Only friendship remains intact in a dramatically tested fashion.Andrs Woods marries the political and the human aspects of this chaotic time in Chile and offers us insights into the ongoing changing governments of South America. His script which he wrote with Eliseo Altunaga Roberto Brodsky and Mamoun Hassan is spare leaving space for much of the story to be told by observing the interaction of his two main characters with their associates. The result is a deeply moving film an opportunity to observe the tenuous times of a period most of us barely understand. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp".

The story though full of twists and turns is as natural and convincing as one can be. It doesn't force your tears.

In those days Chile was undergoing a dire economic crisis which forced him to travel to the Soviet Union to ask for a loan. The situation for Chileans couldn't be worse enterprise owners against leftwinged governmental policies were very reluctant to produce. As a result of the scarcity of basic needs people had to stand in extremely long queues in order to obtain products like bread and milk. Generally these were not enough so they had to do anything to satisfy their hunger. Chile's always been a country full of wandering cats and dogs. However in those years those animals were seldom seen in the streets. On the other side of the coin wealthy people used to go to places where these goods were sold secretly without standing any lines.I think the film very accurately depicts the social political and economic circumstances the country was going through siding with neither Socialism nor Capitalism. Throughout Machuca you will be able to spot the dark side of both political views the rightwinged military brutality and on the other hand the leftwinged expropriation of lands and houses.In short I see Machuca as the Chilean version of the Italian equivalent Life is Beautiful.

	schema:headline " subtle political drama is very good for a chilean movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Good films sometimes come together in pairs or small waves. In that sense Machuca makes a fine companion to the Mexican film Voces Inocentes also released in 2004. Both films are set during tumultuous times in Latin America. Both expose us to the reality of those events through the intriguing new perspective of the eyes of children. Machuca is a much more subtle and subdued film than its Mexican companion almost throughout yet still manages to maintain our interest with some marvelous scenes capturing youthful innocence and its gradual but certain loss.Manuela Martelli provided a standout performer as Gonzalo and Peter's young female friend. There seems to be a cinematic movement to show more and more teen actors in romantic situations and this film doesn't shy away from pushing the age limit down a few years. While all the performances in Machuca are good they seemed to me just a tad short of the level achieved in Voces Inocentes. And despite being a part Spanish film the editing and other production values seemed just a touch less than the worldclass level achieved by its Mexican companion. But I hesitate to say anything negative about this subtle and touching film. Machuca is definitely worth watching and it is probably the best Chilean film to date.Finally a word on the politics I was raised in US colleges to believe that Allende was some kind of martyr crucified by the CIA. While the US certainly helped kill him his rule did anything but make Chile a workers' paradise. While external forces certainly didn't help him there is no question that his policies created financial and economic hardship above all for the working people of his country who couldn't escape them. If Marxism really worked we would all be speaking Russian now. That said the choices faced by Chileans during the calamity of the 20th century were between Allende's brand of fanatical isolationism or Pinochet's brand of hate fueled mercantilist cronyism. Neither group had the moral high ground and neither group had a solution to Chile's woes and the result was a loss for virtually everyone involved. I think Machuca captured that idea very well.".

Why did it feel so real? Not once it felt emotionally calculated nor pretentious. That's a sign of a great director. Also the young actors were very convincing. Actually I can hardly believe they knew there was a camera around.Another amazing factor in this movie was the authenticity in which it showed us the complexness of life and relationships. It's not easy growing up and honestly we adults really often make it more hard than it ought to be. Folks this ain't Disney. It's rough and tough movie but not totally without humor.
