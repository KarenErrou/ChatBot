There is no real plot other than something that's been used as a subplot in television and in other B class movies.Simple formula.Kidnap people who have some talent to fight.Convince them to fight to the death.Put on shows for the masses and make big money.Okay first tiny little problem is this Where is the money? OBVIOUSLY this is a SUBSCRIPTION based online revenue but it is CHEAP enough for some College kids to afford? RIGHT...Then we have the second fight for our main hero David Lord. He is supposed to kill his opponent in less than 3 minutes or the wife of his friend dies. Guess who his opponent is?....Yep you guessed it his friend.Now if you do the math the ONLY way his friend would be inclined to fight is if HE were told that if he won his wife and he would be set free.SO you have a man that has trained ALL HIS LIFE with weaponry in Martial Arts and he manages to get beaten? Okay David Lord IS a Marine but seriously able to beat an opponent who has trained all his life with the Katana? I think not.I'm only halfway through viewing this but I already know how it's going to end. Unless you're really into watching some senseless killing give it a pass. If the second half of this movie changes my mind I'll be back to alert you that my original take on it was wrong. I'm big enough to admit that.Well I'm back and surprise surprise I was NOT wrong. To say it's a contrived ending leaving us open for a sequel is an understatement. I go with my first warning to you. Give it a pass and a wide berth.".

This doesn't seem to make much of an attempt at serving up anything significantly fresh though except perhaps the effects technology to up the bar slightly on gore.The topic is the public's tendency to get hooked on sadistic voyeurism and the people who use that tendency to make moneypower. Samuel L. Jackson plays the man taking advantage and although Samuel is usually great and I would SO like to say even Samuel's awesomeness couldn't save this film I actually can't even say that. I found his performance here to be somewhat subSamuel. His heart just didn't seem in it and for that I can not blame him too much as the material just isn't worthy of his efforts.I'm not sure what exactly got Mr. Jackson stuck with this job but I have a feeling it was a reluctant favor to firsttime director Jonah Loop who handled visual effects on a couple of Sam's other films.The film progresses somewhat as one would expect albeit with a little window dressing. I found myself wanting to fastforward often which I took as a bad sign. Cinematography effects sound etc. were on Hollywood par though and everyone else's acting was actually pretty good perhaps the rookie director was too intimidated by Jackson to offer him much direction in comparison. Hopefully with some better ideas that everyone can actually care about this director can pull off some good films in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I agree with the highly negative reviews already posted I didn't find it quite as offensively bad as they did. Sure the fight choreography was poor at times but it wasn't nearly as bad as Amsterdam Heavy. The acting wasn't much better but it was still about par for the genre. I guess this is place where I'm supposed to express incredulity over Sam Jackson appearing in this movie but really everyone who watches lots of low budget directtovideo movies knows that he'll appear in anything. He's done some really mediocre and even bad movies in the past.Anyways the main plot consists of a James Bond villain Sam Jackson kidnapping people and forcing them into fighting to the death. That's it. Nothing else. No pretenses to art here. Now if the fight choreography and stunts were good I might able to suggest this to fans of directtovideo B movies inspired by Enter the Dragon and Bloodsport. Unfortunately they're really not very well done with some of them looking downright crappy and unimpressive. Some others however end up looking pretty decent though nowhere near Enter The Dragon or Bloodsport. The direction focuses on stylized bloody violence with fast cuts slow motion and lots of posing. If Michael Bay drives you nuts I doubt you'll like this much either.There's a rather surprising amount of gratuitous exploitation in this movie. If you're prudish at all I'd warn you to avoid it. There's constant gory violence and occasional full frontal nudity female only making this one of the most overt unapologetic and cynical attempts at making a mainstream action movie that I've seen recently. I guess they're saying that if the nudity doesn't get you off the violence will like we're all a bunch overstimulated sociopaths. There's a satirical element to all this gratuitous exploitation but I think it was inserted merely to deflect criticism.If you're looking for exploitation there's plenty of that. Otherwise I'd say you're best off skipping it. The action scenes aren't good enough. Some people have criticized this as being pornographic and I have to agree the violence seems to be almost fetishized. However amoral as I am I find the lack of plot and poor fight choreography to be the true problems with this movie.".

The acting is nothing to complain about but the characters are pretty boring. Samuel L.

It had every better if they had developed his character more then I would care a lot more about the people who died. There are lots of people who die but I did not think I really cared it was unfortunate and something that they could have worked more with.This is by no means comparable to Hunger GamesBR but give it a shot if you just want some pretty OK entertainment.".

There are lots of people who die but I did not think I really cared it was unfortunate and something that they could have worked more with.This is by no means comparable to Hunger GamesBR but give it a shot if you just want some pretty OK entertainment.";

We have a hero who has lost a wife and is a drunk... who is seen fighting in a bar by people working for the main bad guy... who is subsequently kidnapped... who is forced to fight to the death with multiple opponents in fights that are sent around the world to people on the Internet. We have seen all this MANY times before except maybe for a minor plot twist towards the end.The movie might have been saved by exciting fights and professional treatment but the movie is lacking in those areas as well. Although there is some bone crunching and blood spilling in the fights most of the fights are surprisingly lacking impact. There's bad use of slow motion stuff happens out of camera range and many times we just see a few seconds of a fight. The movie also looks surprisingly ugly with unattractive colors or lighting throughout.I will admit that this movie is far from the worst directtoDVD movie that's been made.

	schema:reviewBody "I think it's safe to say the director of Arena is a fan of the Starz show Spartacus. This film follows a very similar formula to those stories Take it to the Extreme. Extreme blood. Extreme nudity. Extreme situations. Most American men will be pleased.The film opens with a hokeylooking gladiator fight being viewed by various people around the world. We learn that Death Games is an illegal online program that features real fights to the death. It's a hit with college kids and Japanese office workers around the globe. The FBI Interpol and everyone else are unable to locate them and shut it down.Our hero David Lord Kellen Lutz is in a car crash with his pregnant wife who dies. David finds himself seduced by a hot British lady played by Katia Winter who will no doubt find herself on the watch list of many young men as she is gorgeousa good actressand apparently very willing to do fullfrontal nudity. If nothing else I think she gives the perfect audition for the actual Spartacus show.Samuel L. Jackson plays the ringleader of the online fighting business. He is delightfully overthetop although it is difficult to get the question of why is he in this movie? out of your head. Clearly he owed the director a favor or something.Amazingly he probably gives the WORST performance of the film. The main character the chick and the assorted bad guys are all pretty decent but Sam feels a bit wooden even when he's shouting and dancing around. I agree with another reviewer who theorized that perhaps the director was a bit intimidated when directing the great Samuel L. Jackson. Still I will give him tremendous props for agreeing to do this movie. Nothing wrong with helping people out and he is actually IN the movie unlike many celebrity cameo parts in modern films where the big name only appears in one or two scenes.The fight scenes are a mixed bag. They are pretty bloody but the great fight choreography of Spartacus is missing. They also have an annoying Vignette effect on all the fights that darkens the corners of the frame...I found it distracting. There are things that work though. The first fight looks a little odd but then you realize that even in the movie they are meant to look a little odd since they are filmed in a green screen room and then given fake backgrounds. This is part of the plot as the fight locations change each time. One fight might be in a gladiator style with swords and armor another in a world war I style with trenches and bayonets. That was very clever and well done.One thing the film does well is a bit of fourth wall humor. References to other movies and TV shows including a direct reference to Spartacus as well as a hilarious Office Space moment with a twist really help remind the viewer that this movie is ultimately meant to be fun.The main character Kellen Lutz was a surprise. I'd never heard of the guy but he was pretty good. You don't hate him for being a pretty boy since he gets himself pretty bloodied and messed up. He definitely seems to be channeling the late great Andy Whitfield from Spartacus with his cold stares and angry slowmotion screaming he even kind of looks like Andy.As I mentioned earlier Katia Winter stole the show with her Femme Fatale character. Despite the fact that after her third nude scene even I was questioning exactly WHY she needed to be in the buff so much I enjoyed the hell out of her performance even when clothed! She has the perfect evil Bond girl that turns good attitude and I predict we'll be seeing a lot more of her in the future.The director Jonah Loop is a veteran special effects producer on many big movies. Despite the lowbudget it's evident there is talent behind the camera. The movie is very well shot and edited to the point where you actually forget the lowbudge origins at times. It's really only the fight scenes that look a little hokey. I'd say the guy did a great job with what he had and I certainly will check out his future efforts.If you are a fan of shows like Spartacus or movies like Gamer this is one you should check out. If nothing else I guarantee you will not be bored.".

While I did see the others first it may have skewed my judgment but this was much slower then I was expecting. The plot is...take a guy with no family force him to fight and kill for his freedom while the evil creator watches. Very predictable and is really only worth watching for the fighting and nudity. On the other hand why else would you watch this anyway? Overall not a bad movie but the plot is starting to get old and over used. That makes it lose the excitement and impact. Because of unoriginality I give it a B.Would I watch again?  Not this one...but again I'm sure next month another version will come out.Also try  Gamer  Death Race 1  2".

And to be honest his flicks always get better ratings than they should which is not surprising he is one of the most likable and charismatic actors in Hollywood. I always wonder can the actors predict how awful a movie is going to be before signing up for it. The answer more and more often seems to be they can't. The first question an actor should ask the producer is how high is the budget then they should really carefully read the script. The choice between acting in one good movie every two years or in three mediocre ones a year should be obvious. But it's not!

	schema:reviewBody "This film was pure art that most failed to recognize. If you haven't seen the film yet I encourage you to watch it before seeing the rest my review because realization will further enrich the film for you rather than me telling you this.The film showed sequences of people watching and making rude comments at the gory fights which I took as a beautiful mirror that was supposed to show that you were doing the same thing. You may have related to the disgusted girl or maybe you were more like the casually watching businessman. Or maybe you didn't relate to anyone and the symbol fell on deaf ears. Irregardless the stage design was great and the effects complimented it in how the bad guys used a green screen to generate their backdrops. The acting was great and there were few lines. I say this as a positive since the lines used were poetic and thought provokingexcept the college students although I liked how accurate it was to reality. The use of silence was supposed to make you feel disconnected trapped.I have so much more good to say but I don't want it to be too disproportionate to the negative. The story was highly predictable since I knew how it would end from the very beginning. The characters were mostly flat even the main one I would have trouble considering round.Overall a good film. I would consider it a guy movie but that's my gender stereotyping kicking in. If you hate it so be it. Don't call it a bad movie though I've seen some pretty bad movies and this one doesn't even come close to their level. Just don't go into it thinking you're about to see the best movie ever because it has it's faults. Enjoy.".

If you haven't seen the film yet I encourage you to watch it before seeing the rest my review because realization will further enrich the film for you rather than me telling you this.The film showed sequences of people watching and making rude comments at the gory fights which I took as a beautiful mirror that was supposed to show that you were doing the same thing. You may have related to the disgusted girl or maybe you were more like the casually watching businessman. Or maybe you didn't relate to anyone and the symbol fell on deaf ears. Irregardless the stage design was great and the effects complimented it in how the bad guys used a green screen to generate their backdrops. The acting was great and there were few lines. I say this as a positive since the lines used were poetic and thought provokingexcept the college students although I liked how accurate it was to reality.

During those scenes I felt like their only purpose was to add minutes to the film. I think 10 fights is way too much. 5 full fights each with good choreography and a few slow motion hits would do the trick I think. David's many wounds heal unrealistically quick. I also find the sudden change in David's personality really oddunnatural I guess some of it can be explained by the whole undercover operation. Still I get the feeling that he mixed a few of his priorities and that he even liked all the killing and sex ok I know what's not to like about the second. I think he didn't express enough of the burden of taking innocent lives. I was surprised somewhat by the twist at the end but I still cant figure out how did Samuel L. Jackson manage to escape from the building surrounded by police.Overall I think this movie is an average and nothing special really. I still had some fun watching it and Marcelle Baer really gave some spice to it. To unlock it's potential greatness however I'm afraid it would need a little more than just a few finishing touches.".

The movie leads to a climax which is NOT suited to a sequel and which will DESTROY the original movie. I give 9 out of 10 but know that the end if done properly would have rated 10. Why cant they get it right. It would seem that at the end  the directors where more interested in a sequel then in providing viewers with a really good movie. The performance by all actors and actresses is really good but limited by the directors and their reproduction of the original story. I think producers rely too much on sequels today to make a movie rate 10 out of 10. this came very close in my books but was destroyed in the end. We do not all want to watch sequels and this should be drummed into producers and directors. Why kill a VERY good movie just for a few extra dollars.

However when Ho is betrayed by the bosses he is sent to jail and his father murdered leaving Kit marked within the force and bitter towards Ho.  Mark takes revenge on those who set up Ho but suffers severe damage to his leg as a result.  When Ho comes out of prison Mark is reduced to cleaning up for new boss Shing.  Ho and Mark resolve to move on but Shing has other ideas and also plans to deal with Kit to stop him investigating. With the police and mob closing in Ho Mark and Kit are forced to take a stand.As part of my build up to see Bullet Proof Monk I have been watching some of Mr Chow's HK action movies again  just to remind me how good an actor he is when he is used well.  A Better Tomorrow was Chow's big break through from television to movies and also the film that kick started John Woo's career after a couple of commercial failures.  The plot is nicely overwrought and has a strong focus on the male relationship of friends and brothers.  Honour plays strong in all scenes and it is actually quite involving despite the focus on gun play and action.The action is good but dated.  This is to be expected after about 20 years but it does still stand up well.  The action is pretty over the top but also well choreographed to appear even more exciting than it is.  Happily the plot stands up by itself and the film has a lot less action than later Woo films The Killer and Hard Boiled.  I really got into the lives and destinies of the men involved and the strength of feeling and perhaps debts of honour between them was palatable.The strong characters are greatly helped by strong actors in all the leads. Chow is particularly good as he has to play two very different stages of his character and does them both very well although the supercool part must have come easier to him.  Ti Lung is clearly the lead here and does good work even if he is a little too righteous and moral to be a gangster. Leslie Cheung is good after a slow start required by his character.  Lee Waise plays a good villain and only the female characters are as weak as they often are in these films.Overall this film is regarded as a classic and responsible for the birth of the genre and certainly the genesis of many Hollywood action movies of today how many multiplex goers who marvelled over the lobby shootout in the Matrix have even heard of this film?.  It has dated a little bit but the action is still as outrageous as ever and still as exciting despite a slight feeling of seeing it bigger somewhere else.  The film's main strength to me is simply the male characters' relationships within the plot  they get me involved in the film and make the action even more dramatic.".

A Better Tomorrow is often reported as the best movie John Woo has done and while it is certainly a superior staple on his resume the movie's tone is a little off and although the movie is very well done the movie gets a tad too melodramatic at times. However that minor flaw aside A Better Tomorrow provides an unusually rich story that details a rocky relationship that seems to never be forgiven. Indeed even at the end we doubt whether the brothers will ever be as close as they once were. Ti Lung and Leslie Cheung are very good in their roles but it really is Chow Yun Fat that sells the movie and his performance as an out of work assassin provides a tragic figure that is far more tragic than the relationship between Lung and Cheung. As noted the acting is flawless with Cheung turning in a flawless 180 degree turn in his character. A Better Tomorrow while not the best movie from John Woo is still a rewarding tale.  12 out of 4Very good".

	schema:reviewBody "When this film was made in the 1980's Hong Kong cinema was dominated by wushu films and bizarre swordplay movies involving people flying around and other acid flashback inducing scenarios. John Woo was a young director who had done a string of martial arts films comedies and musicals. In 1981 he split from Golden harvest and joined Cinema city after a couple of comedies He directed the modern day action film Sunset Warrior and it was held on the shelf and not released. After the failure of Sunset Warrior he was sent to Taiwan and directed another two comedies. Returning to Hong Kong Woo had always wanted to make a modern day gangster film. Teaming up with friend and producer Tsui Hark they made a film that would inspire countless films for years to come. Casting Chow Yun Fat who was mainly a television actor as one lead an old school Kung Fu actor in another and a singer in the third lead role it was a risky venture which paid off. The script is great featuring lines such as Do you believe in God? sure i'm one you are a god is someone who controls their own destiny. There is strong characterisation of the characters aided on by perfect performances from the actors The action choreography was excellent and inspired virtually every film made involving guns ever since. It makes you realise that the only thing the matrix didn't take from this film and it's sequels is the plot. This is one of my favourite films of all time and if everyone in the world saw this I guarantee that the sales of matchsticks and toothpicks would soar.".

	schema:reviewBody "The relationship between two brothers on opposite sides of the law and the loyalty of friends is explored in A Better Tomorrow' an actiondrama directed by John Woo.  As with any Woo film there's plenty of action here but at the heart of the film is the story itself and that's what sets Woo apart from all other socalled action' directors.  Woo frames the drama with some astoundingly intricate and well choreographed action sequences gun play and hand to hand fighting but integrates the story seamlessly which raises this film as with all of his films levels higher than the average action movie.  In this one older brother Ho Lung Ti is a high ranking member of a crime syndicate specializing in counterfeit money his younger brother Kit Leslie Cheung is beginning his career as a detective. Complicating matters is the death of their father Feng Tien and the involvement of Ho's best friend and colleague Mark Chow YunFat and Kit's girl Jackie Emily Chu.  In the end at the core of the action it becomes a story of love and loyalty and the sacrifices sometimes necessary in life to make it work and give meaning to it all. Woo has impeccable timing not only in the action sequences but with the drama as well he knows how to use the camera to heighten the emotional impact of a pivotal moment and successfully injects a caesura at just the right time which maintains the perfect amount of tension that extends the drama and serves to hold the audience enthralled.  That he can employ these techniques equally within the action and dramatic sequences is why his movies have such wonderful flow and rhythm it creates a whole' as opposed to merely a series of scenes strung together to tell a story.  Directors of all genres would be well served to study Woo's techniques. Woo gets the most out of his actors as well.  Lung Ti gives tremendous depth to the character of Ho successfully conveying the inner struggle of this man attempting to make amends with the brother he loves while the charismatic Chow YunFat gives a riveting performance as Ho's closest friend.  His screen presence is dynamic and commanding.  Woo firmly establishes the depth of loyalty between the two and skillfully the actors make it convincing and credible which makes the final heroics all the more believable.  An exciting memorable film A Better Tomorrow' is thoroughly entertaining and a tribute to a truly great director John Woo who seems to get better with every film he makes.  For a combination of action and drama there isn't another director in the history of movies that does it better than Woo.  I rate this one 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Woo's Ying Huang Boon SikA Better Tomorrow1986 was groundbreaking when first released because of the stylisitc depiction of the action scenes. Its success spurred a new genre in Hong Kong cinema known as Heroic Bloodshed.  These films were usually gangster pics which is characterized by outrageous gun battles heavy action and high melodrama.  Hong Kong cinema in the mid 1980s to early 1990s was in the midst of a gangster film craze similar to Hollywood in the 1930s1940s France in the 1950s1960s Japan in the 1960s1970s and Italy in the 1970s1980s.  A Better Tomorrow1986 is to Heroic Bloodshed what A Fistful of Dollars1966 was to the Spaghetti Western.A Better Tomorrow focuses on the age old themes of honor and loyalty.  The characters of Ho and Mark are honorable gangsters in an era of double crosses and mistrust.  Ho and Mark are at odds with the changing value system and this puts them as people who are outmoded in their principles. Honor and loyalty in A Better Tomorrow1986 is greatly emphasized as the marks of a good hearted person.  Mark Gor is very honorable and loyal in his personalty compared to Shing who is the opposite.John Woo's main concern is to place high importance on the idea of brotherhood.  According to John woo in this film the tight bonding between men is something that was lost among youngsters at that time.  Brotherhood in the film is complex and emotional.  The relationship between Ho and Mark is so strong that there is nothing that can smash it.  The scene where Mark tells of his ordeals at a nightclub as a first time gangster is nostalgic and touching.Famous for the clothes Mark Gor wears as for anything else in the film. Began a trend in fashion around Hong Kong when many people started wearing the same kind of outfit as Mark Gor.  Quentin Tarantino loved the look of Mark that for weeks he dressed like him to feel and look cool.  In John Woo films there is always focus on the fashion of his characters.  Mark Gor was the Rick Blaine of the 1980s.A Better Tomorrow1986 changed the look of action films with the famous use of pistols by Brother Mark in the restaurant.  The first of many elaborate gun battles that dominates the films that follows A Better Tomorrow1986. Although John Woo would film many wonderful action scenes in the next few years there never would be a scene like this one which is full of energy and freshness.  I enjoyed it when Mark Gor places guns inside flower pots as backup because the idea is cleaver and original.  This scene is parodied in the climatic portion of Just Heroes1987.Ying Huang Boon Sik1986 gave stardom to an actor known for his roles in Hong Kong television named Chow Yun Fat.  Before the film's success Chow Yun Fat was considered box office poison by Hong Kong theatre owners.  His charismatic and suave performance as the tragic Mark Gor broke that reputation.  Chow Yun Fat is the best actor to come out of Asian cinema since Toshiro Mifune and Jo Shishido.  He is the most flamboyant actor in the world who is better than any actor that was nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars.The motif of sacrifice for redemption is part of Woo's religious beliefs. The heroes in his bloodshed films perform sacrifices to purify themselves within.  The death of Mark Gor is a big sacrifice because it makes Ho and Kit Brothers again.  What's sad about the death of Mark is its the only way for Ho and Mark to reconcile with each other.  This motif also plays big in The Killer1989 and Bullet in the Head1990.The story is simple but compelling.  Ti Lung made a big comeback with his role after years of mediocrity.  He gives a performance that is deeply emotional and mature.  Leslie Cheung also performs well as the headstrong but naive and stubborn Kit Sung.  Waise Lee is excellent as the pompous and two faced Triad boss Shing.Gunfight at the end of A Better Tomorrow is less high body count and refined than in later John Woo films.  Still exhilarating and fun to watch.  The shootout is filmed in the spirit of Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone.  When Chow Yun Fat comes out shooting like John Wayne the film is at a high adrenaline level.  One of the reasons why I love this movie.Plot becomes more emotionally intense and less melodramatic with the energetic direction of John Woo.  What makes the film work is the large dose of sentlementlty given by John Woo.  He films the action and dramatic scenes with much passion and thoughtfulness.  He is good at directing Chow Yun Fat and Ti Lung in giving great performances.  A Better Tomorrow1986 made John Woo an action guru after years doing comedies and being known as the king of comedy in Hong Kong cinema.".

But being as it is you can watch this movie and see how it is done correctly. Replacement Killers eat your heart out! This movie still is superior to imitators such as the named one or a few others. Yes I know that some have argued that it is dated and other movies such as Matrix have not only copied some of it's styles but improved them. Not for me they haven't!

All of his films deal with issues like the gray area between good and bad whether loyalty to one's family or one's profession ought to take precedence the extent to which actions determine one's character and so on. People criticize his movies for featuring protagonists which leap around in ridiculous ways shooting endless bullets never having to reload. They're missing the point because Woo doesn't care at all for realism. He is more interested in creating a sort of superhero mythology featuring more or less reallife characters that use extreme violence as a means of selfrealization and working out moral issues.Anyway although A Better Tomorrow doesn't actually feature all that many action scenes although the ones that are here are really good especially the scene in the restaurant it's still somehow my favorite of his Hong Kong films. It has heart the acting by Chow YunFat is really great and for some reason I also really dig the music. I can't really offer good reasons why I like this one better than Hard Boiled and The Killer because the action is technically better in those two. But I prefer this one.".

Stylistically it is easily identified as a Woo film and doesn't really transcend the action film genre but it does work marvelously within the confines of that genre.Some consider The Killer or HardBoiled to be the better John Woo HK film but I find that while the Killer and HardBoiled both have tighter more elegant action sequences what really makes A Better Tomorrow lead the pack is the plot. It isn't an entirely original plot but it is well acted enough that you really feel for the characters and can understand the motivations. It isn't a typical action movie plot where the script serves simply as a device to create interesting action sequences. You get traditional Chinese themes such as honor loyalty and strong family ties.As always Chow Yun Fat is a pleasure to watch. He is simply one of the coolest action stars in the entire global movie industry. You could search far and wide and not find a more suave action star than the dualpistol wielding cigaretteinmouth Chow Yun Fat. Worth watching for his presence alone. If you only know him from the American films he has done then you are doing yourself a disservice.In summation if you like action films you will love A Better Tomorrow. It's that simple.

But like most of John Woo's movies it is about the action! The three main characters are Chow Yan Fat Ti Lung and Leslie Cheung. Although Ti Lung and Leslie Cheung give good performances! Chow Yan fat steals the show by far! It is a joy to see himno matter what scene it is! He is the embodiment of coolness in this movie! It is to bad such a fine and versatile actor doesn't get the chance to make really good movies in Hollywood! As I mentioned before this movie is about the action! The slow mo shootouts are superb. The scene where Mark kills some bad guys after they betrayed Ti Lung is classic and is parodied very often! You will see why! The setup to this shootout is great! I can go on and on! For that time the ending is extraordinary! It is a prequel to John Woo's later work! Check it out if you haven't done so already! This movie is excellent!".

That way I can report to you on various subhobbies  like the one concerned with style and camera choreography. That's why I sought out this film at any rate there's a cinematic subart associated with the imposition of style on a ballet of gunfights. John Woo is a major figure in this little corner of cinema.My own preference is for less overt choreography more choreographed cameramovements more style in the image and less strutting in the character. That's why I prefer Karwai Wong. But there were parts of faceoff and MI2 whose excess along these lines thrilled me despite the strutting men.So now we come to what many believe is the earliest successful attempt at Wooist style. Looking at the first films of a master is often pretty rewarding. After all nearly every film of this type is a bad film painful in places. So watching one a little less good is no sacrifice we watch these for moments. And in earlier films those moments are often fresher more exciting.And that's the case here. There are some really horrid sequences like the tussle resulting in the father's death. And there's the junky story  oh and bad acting even by Hong Kong standards. But there are a couple sequences that are very successful both involving Yunfat Chow of course toward the beginning he takes revenge and later he steals a computer tape. These are raw but distinctive. Notice what the camera chooses to see small lives in each death small expressions of individuality and character as each person appears on the screen for only a few seconds before they are killed. It is as if Woo creates a kanji character named Mark! who spends a second or two creating quick kanji of subcharacters making them live by taking their lives.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 4 Has some interesting elements".

But the film is not really a action film as this film is less actionlike and more dramatic than most John woo films.As it focuses on two brothers and a young man on the verge on finding a better life.The film has great memorable likable characters Powerful acting a great pacing and a Soundtrack that has you tuning for days.The film is about a gangster name Ho who is trying to escape his gangster life to protect and lookout for his younger brother Kit. Kit is a upincoming police officer who has no idea what his brother does for a career.Ho is given a assignment to go to Taiwan for a deal but is setup by his driver Shing and Ho is arrested and sent to prison. After hearing this Ho's friend and partner Mark goes to avenge his partner to go to Taiwan to kill the person that set him up.in the process Mark is shot in the leg and left cripple.Three Years later Ho is release from jail and finds out things have changed.His brother has become more bitter and has hatred for his brother for being a gangster and blames him for his father's death.Mark before being a wellknown gangster has become a car washer and a bum living in a parking garage.He has thrown his gangster life away and lost it in a blink of an eye and Shing Ho's old driver is now the boss. Ho is trying to reconcile with his brother but due to his deephatred he has for him and now his old gang wanting to get rid of Ho and Mark for being pests things are getting tough in Ho's life.The film feels like a drama film than of a action film. Because half of the film is Kit and Ho trying to accept each other and also Mark's Struggle to come back to his old gangster life and prove he's more than just a gangster than knows how to use two guns.but this drama is far from boring making these characters real and believable as well.As for character development it's on top form.We learn that Ho is a wise caring man who is looking out for his brother from danger.but goes though a lot because he has chosen to leave the criminal life and lookout for his brother and Mark making him a likable character.Kit is a first a carefree person but when he finds about his brother he becomes a troubled character with a lot of angered inside him and cannot forgive his brother at all for what he has done.Mark is the most likable character in the film from being a Dynamic funfree smooth character in the beginning to a Man trying to become man looking for a better life as well.Thanks to the characters the acting is in topshape.Ti Lung gives well performance as Ho as he makes his character believable and bring a level of emotion as well pulling off amount of range.Leslie Chung is great as Kit.as he plays the naive bitter character well making him into somewhat of a spoiled brat.But when all said and done ChowYun Fat steals the show as Mark.He fits into his role well as the comical Mark and enjoys playing his character despite the fact in the beginning of the film he plays the role a bit overthetop.But it's his climax performance that steals the show.making you want to crying in his dramatic sense when he tells Ho he wants to be a better man.Overall this is great movie you will enjoy it I'm telling you You will.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before Broken Arrow hit the silver screen with John Travolta and Christian Slater there was this wonderful gem to come out of Hong Kong. Chow Yun Fat was his absolute best when he starred in this gritty and action filled segment about the criminal underworld. Two brothers... one a cop the other brother is part of an organization that deals in counterfeiting as well as drugs and weapons. Lung Ti who plays the corrupted prince is betrayed and sent to prison in Taipei for dealing in counterfeiting by one of his own men behind the curtains. Released after... he decides to try and patch things up with his younger brother who had graduated from the police academy but things do not go to plan.Ostracized Sung Tse Ho tries to adapt back into the social status as a cab driver to make an honest living but the dregs led by the new head of the criminal underworld Waise Lee or Shing who had betrayed him wants Ho back into the fold. Marred by his past Sung finally realizes his worth by protecting his brother at all costs by stopping Shing with damming evidence which he hands off to his younger brother. Mark Chow Yun Fat helps him regain his dignity through some heavy fire fighting as well as taking a severe beating by Shing and his gang.For nineteen eighty six this was one of the most emotional films to date to come out of china. Nearly every movie that does hold a monotonous amount of one dimensional Kung Fu battles or gun fights to outweigh the story line. I found none of that nonsense in this rare movie. Chow Lung and Leslie Chung all had great parts to play. A trio in fantastic ranges of acting that made this wonderful tale one of my favourites. It then led on to other films for which Chow Yun Fat became as classic icon using his body style and gracious persona to coat the silver screen with his incredible talent.For those who love good cop stories this one is it. Betrayal deep bonding friendship corruption action and emotional baggage for the more intellectual mind can appreciate in a great story. Ten out of ten stars.".

Despite the title Better tomorrow I don't see this happening to anyone but Kit  Leslie Chueng  and his brother because other people are all dead. Another viewer did a very good job of describing the story line and there is not much to add to that. If you like action then you'll probably like this movie but it was little too much for this viewer's taste.";

It's fun and innocent but it carries the typical Disney fantastical vibe as well.

Unfortunately for the family Ray Jr. Breckin Meyer lacks the racing talent that his father grandfather and sister possess and the team is now struggling to keep sponsors from backing out after numerous crashes and defeats on the track. Maggie dreams of racing for the team but her father desperately wants her to use her college degree and leave the horrible world of racing behind. We're never really told why her father considers professional racing to be so lowly a profession given that it produces dozens of respectable sports stars and oh yeah lots and lots of money but again let's stick to the original suspension of disbelief mantra and we'll have no trouble with his opinion of the sport. Maggie comes across Herbie and quickly learns that the car has a mind of its own and can magically propel her and her family into fame and fortune on the racetrack.The movie is complete with a standard gardenvariety villain Trip Murphy Matt Dillon a fourtime NASCAR champion who despite being competent enough to win the Nextel Cup series four times cannot keep his mind off an impromptu street race that he lost to Herbie. He acts like a jerk flings insults at Maggie and generally struts around like he's better than everyone thus enabling the audience to despise him. Plus he was like totally mean to Herbie and called him a piece of junk! You just don't talk about Herbie like that and I so kept hoping he'd get his comeuppance in the end.I did like the movie however because from a certain standpoint it is enjoyable to watch. Herbie himself has several humorous moments and I couldn't help but like him. Given that this wasn't a documentary it's forgivable in its transgressions on reality which in the end make the movie more entertaining. It's lighthearted and doesn't attempt to beat the audience down with a message ahem Sharkboy  LavaGirl. I highly recommend Herbie Fully Loaded for kids and for those who like cute and wholesome moviesif you're simply looking for a good pickme up and a fun movie then this is definitely one that you shouldn't miss.Just...don't get caught up in the details.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been hearing things about Herbie Fully Loaded for at least the past 6 months. I saw the trailer and was not impressed at all saw the dull poster which also didn't do anything for me. I also have to admit I was very leery to see this film especially after such a lame trailer dull poster and hearing about Lindsay Lohan's recent behavior and seeing how she looks like a poor sickly child from Nigeria. But anyway I went to see the movie anyway at a sneak preview nonetheless and despite all Lohan's bad publicity lately and the film's lousy marketing campaign I was actually pretty impressed with the final product of Herbie Fully Loaded. Herbie Fully Loaded takes off right where the other movies left off. Herbie is now washed up and in the junk yard just about to be made into strap metal but just then Maggie A healthy and attractive looking Linday Lohan comes to the junk yard to get a car. Why a junk yard you may ask? Because her dad Michael Keaton is a NASCAR Coach and so he knows how to repair cars. So Maggie decides to buy Herbie and before you can say Love Bug Maggie notices that Herbie has a mind of his own not to mention has the power to be a race car. And so the cheesy but fun Herbie adventure begins.I actually enjoyed this film which came as a huge shock to me. Like I said earlier this movie had some of the worst marketing and advertising that I have ever seen for a film. However I am very grateful that the film didn't actually suck like the marketing on this film did. So anyway having seen the earlier Herbie films I was actually very impressed with this one.It was also good to see a healthy and attractive Lindsay Lohan again on screen. I have been seeing nothing but this anorectic skinny ugly girl on the cover of various magazines for the past month or so. I am really sad that Hollywood has gotten to her head because the girl has talent she's just falling into the fame and fortune trap of Hollywood. But I don't want to get into my feelings on Lohan right now but just comment on how much I enjoyed her performance in the movie and how it is probably my favorite role for her since Freaky Friday. Michael Keaton was also very good in his role as the father figure. He also plays one heck of a believable NASCAR Coach. Also I would like to mention Justin Long Kevin in the film who is one of Hollywood's new up and coming actors. I really dig this guy in his previous films like Dodgeball Galaxy Quest  Jeepers Creepers along with his role in this film. The guy plays very likable characters and I really liked him as the long lost friend in Herbie. Also Matt Dillon stars as NASCAR Driver Trip Murphy who plays the bad guy with no problem at all which isn't hard since Matt Dillon usually always plays the jerk or unlikable character.The film's most enjoyable character is of course Herbie who as long as you can remember is a classic character can still be enjoyed. I liked how they updated Herbie a bit but didn't over do it. It was enjoyable to see the connection between Herbie and Maggie. Herbie of course is extremely far fetched like the whole racing in the NASCAR tournament but you cheer for him because he is the underdog. It's nice to see a simple family movie like this being released into theaters at a time where computer animation films like Shrek The Incredibles and Madagascar are kings. I know this movie doesn't compare to the first two films mentioned but I feel it's just as good as Madagascar or a lot of other family films released in the last few years. Like I said it's a simple yet enjoyable film. It has nothing that would offend any children and is enjoyable for Herbie fans and as well as adults.The film's most memorable scene for me was the scene where Herbie just got bought and comes out of the junk yard and Maggie is trying to drive him to the repair shop to meet up with Kevin Justin Long but she finds out that Herbie has a mind of his own and Herbie drives her. It becomes very enjoyable from this point to see how Herbie and Maggie share their emotions going through anger sadness and the feeling of being unwanted.So in the end Herbie Fully Loaded is much better then the bad trailers lead it to be. It has a lot of heart a decent story and is as enjoyable as the previous Herbie Films. Herbie gets a little upgrade and they throw in some corny love bug jokes but hey they are harmless and can be taken with a grain of salt. Overall I was happy to see Lindsay Lohan looking healthy and enjoying herself on screen along with an old fashioned family film that we rarely see anymore. I think if you're a fan of Herbie you should see this if you have kids take them and enjoy and finally if you have nothing to better to do and want to see a harmless fun film check out Herbie Fully Loaded because although it's pretty cheesy its also a fun and enjoyable time.MovieManMenzel's final rating for Herbie Fully Loaded is a 7 out of 10.".

It becomes very enjoyable from this point to see how Herbie and Maggie share their emotions going through anger sadness and the feeling of being unwanted.So in the end Herbie Fully Loaded is much better then the bad trailers lead it to be. It has a lot of heart a decent story and is as enjoyable as the previous Herbie Films. Herbie gets a little upgrade and they throw in some corny love bug jokes but hey they are harmless and can be taken with a grain of salt. Overall I was happy to see Lindsay Lohan looking healthy and enjoying herself on screen along with an old fashioned family film that we rarely see anymore. I think if you're a fan of Herbie you should see this if you have kids take them and enjoy and finally if you have nothing to better to do and want to see a harmless fun film check out Herbie Fully Loaded because although it's pretty cheesy its also a fun and enjoyable time.MovieManMenzel's final rating for Herbie Fully Loaded is a 7 out of 10.";

It captured the fun spirit of the original movesI felt like very little time had passed and the same magic was present in this movie. It's was fun zany cute and endearing.My nine year old daughter and I laughed and cheered through the whole thing. It's a solid 'A' rating and 55 stars in both of our eyes. We couldn't stop talking about how good it was after leaving the theater.The acting wouldn't win an Oscar but was more than adequate for a kids' movie.The story was well written. It did a great job bridging the past to the current timeframe. It was also pretty original and employed modern racing car themes like monster trucks and NASCAR.I don't understand why the general public and professional critics are rating it so low. It's a kids' movie and likewise one has to have the correct mindset when viewing it. I was swept away from the beginning and it kept me engaged. So many other movies these days have various flaws that keep coming to mind when you watch them this movie was just fine.Go see this movie with your kids. It's refreshingly clean and a blast!".

	schema:reviewBody "So back when Herbie made his first appearance I was perfectly happy watching Dean Jones mug away. I only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly buttered popcorn. Now unfortunately I have expectations of a rivetingdelightful story whenever I watch a movie if I'm not on some sort of medication. And this is another good movie for the medicated. There are no major laughs no complex plot lines no difficult twists. Herbie Fully Loaded is great for the fully loaded.This was the first time I had seen La Lohan on the screen since she swapped places with Jamie Lee Curtis I thought she was excellent in that and I can't say I was terribly impressed this time around. Aside from her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color she just didn't ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road racers. Her 'need for speed' wasn't portrayed consistently in the film  perhaps it was elsewhere  she looked older than her part and seemed to always be looking for something a party? designer togs? new place to spend money? off set. I couldn't see any chemistry with Justin Long that romance seemed obligatory at best. The only time Lindsay appeared engaged was when she was interacting with Matt Dillon who I thought was appropriately over the top as Evil Bad Guy Trip Murphy.It was great to see Herbie again and I loved the movie intro with material from the old movies. If Disney had popped out with some Car 53 jewelry I might have worn some just to be loyal. His new feature ? was a little inconsistent does he channel the thoughts of his driver? Does he now skateboard? but whatever. We all knew how it was going to end but I do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than Maggie. And my head still hurts from that lesson Maggie and we viewers had hammered home. What would have made the movie worthwhile? Have the old Herbie in a real story with a real plot  at the very least Herbie's as good as Lassie  but clearly that's asking too much. Why is it that Disney always goes back to the same well as Herbie Goes Bananas and the Computer That Wore Tennis Shoes when it comes to innovation? I'm sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations. For the rest of us....it's for when you have the 'flu and just can't take the suspense of Rear Window.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first thing I want to say about this movie is that after the opening credits it has about 5 to 10 minutes of THE WORST acting save Halle Berry's friend in Catwoman. BUT if you wait this out you'll at least be entertained by the movie.Herbie Fully Loaded is definitely a family movie. If you're not going with a family or aren't a longtime Herbie fan wait until it's on DVD. Herbie is chock full of familyfriendly humor and a triedandtrue Disney style storyline.What's the story in a nutshell you ask? Well Lindsay Lohan just graduates from college no that's not a typo they actually expect us to believe Lindsay Lohan is about 22 not the 1819 that she looks. Her father Michael Keaton takes her to a salvage yard to find a car for her graduation present. She finds Herbie Herbie finds her bingbangboom she street races a NASCAR pro Matt Dillon. Yadayadayada stuff happens typical Disney finish.Now I had two MAJOR issues with the movies. First of those being that whenever CGI is used it is Blatantly obvious. Sometimes nonCGI effects are obvious too! What do I mean? In one shot where Herbie is doing some tricky driving an incredibly mannish stunt driver in a ugly wig can be seen doubling although silhouetted for Lohan in Herbie.Two there are plot holes galore. I can't think of any off hand but I remember noticing things that happened that didn't make much sense.Also this movie has some of the BEST MUSIC compilation wise I have ever heard in a movie. I'm not good with names of bands and songs so I'm not sure if the good songs are on the soundtrack but if they are the soundtrack is a definite buy for any classic rock fan. If you completely ignore this review and see the movie by yourself or on a date SPECIFICALLY listen for the music.All in all this movie is a good family movie. Don't expect it to win any awards. If you can deal with lackluster CGI a dud of a beginning and a standard Disney storyline then you'll be pleasantly entertained.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Maggie Peytton is not overly impressed when her graduation gift from her race driver father is a busted VW beetle. Planning to ditch it at a gathering of car fans Maggie inadvertently finds herself in a promotional street race with undefeated NASCAR champion Trip Murphy. What nobody knows is that this little VW is none other than former sensation Herbie  sadly now confined to the scrap heap of history literally. When Maggie wins Murphy is outraged and sets out to engineer a rematch while Maggie tries to work out quite what it is about this little car that makes her drive so fast.I think it is important to come into this film as a fan of the Herbie films rather than someone for whom the laws of thermodynamics must be rigidly applied across all film genres. I say this because much of the film is absurd and there will be those wringing their hands about the simply impossible moves that the little car makes however these same people should also keep in mind that they are watching a film about a mischievous car that is alive. It is important to enter into the spirit of the film and in fairness Fully Loaded does help the viewer as much as possible by being wonderfully charming and disarming.It doesn't really have a bad bone in its body and I must admit that I found it refreshingly clean family entertainment that was easy to enjoy even if it was just as easy to forget. Of course if you're not sold on this charm and find it grating or silly from the start then you should bail out because it will not get easier for you as it gets sillier the longer it goes on. Director Robinson delivers a good clean script really well not making it post0ironic but totally hitting the innocent charm that made the character so good in the first place. Herbie himself is quite fun but it is the main cast that do the harder job of getting the mood right.Ignore her reallife personae and just watch Lohan for what she does here and you'll find her performance to be quite good and fitting the film. Keaton Dillon Long and Meyer are all solid and provide the film with a professional feel in the cast. Overall then this is a fun and clean family film that is surprisingly charming and effective. Getting into the swing with it is important as the action is very silly at times and it is only if you are feeling it that you can forgive it. For me I was right there with it and enjoyed it for the simple fun it was.".

There were several scenes that could have been taken right out of The Love Bug and the like which some of the older Herbie fans will come to enjoy.

It'd be like beating a physically handicapped kid in arm wrestling  it's way easy but you walk away without really accomplishing anything and you feel kind of bad afterwards.Plus I'm not exactly part of the main demographic for this movie and if you aren't part of the demographic then why would you even consider paying money to see it? What are you expecting? This is a movie about a lifelike car that spits exhaust in the faces of bad guys leaks oil on their bad guy shoes and opens its trunk doors or glove compartment whenever something needs to be revealed or somebody needs to be strategically hit in a slapstick manner. If those types of shenanigans send you rolling down the aisles in apoplectic fits of laughter then you're in luck. However if you're like me and aren't quite so easily amused then you might want to veer your hardearned dollars in another direction.Even though I've never been a fan of the Herbie series and this movie did nothing to make me a convert there are some positives. The most important being that Lindsay Lohan is looking very good and is in fine preanorexia prefake blonde form. She claims her current look Ode De Skeletal Olsen Twin is for a movie she's doing in which she plays a fashion designer and she promises to put her weight back on. I hope so because she definitely looks better with a little meat on them bones! The second positive is that the entire cast is giving it their best. They're not given great material to work with but at least they look like they're having a little fun. I'm quite sure Matt Dillon is well aware that this isn't exactly a step up from his previous movie Crash but he doesn't use that as an excuse to phone in his performance so I have to give credit there.I think they should've renamed the movie though. I would've suggested Herbie Fully Loaded WITH MUSIC MONTAGES! Sheesh. I honestly don't think I've ever seen one movie with that many montages. At times I thought I was watching a series of Disney music videos. What in the world? Was this a prime example of avoiding dialogue? Oh well. At times boring and never threatening to entice riotous laughter Herbie at least moves along at a decent pace and is never quite so stupid that it's intellectually insulting so I won't be too harsh. I'm sure it's loads of fun for the really young under 7. However when I asked my 10yearold brother what he thought of the movie he replied It was OK. When I asked if he thought it was funny he replied Kind of. I guess. Not exactly a ringing endorsement but not a total condemnation either.".

I would've suggested Herbie Fully Loaded WITH MUSIC MONTAGES! Sheesh. I honestly don't think I've ever seen one movie with that many montages. At times I thought I was watching a series of Disney music videos. What in the world? Was this a prime example of avoiding dialogue? Oh well. At times boring and never threatening to entice riotous laughter Herbie at least moves along at a decent pace and is never quite so stupid that it's intellectually insulting so I won't be too harsh. I'm sure it's loads of fun for the really young under 7. However when I asked my 10yearold brother what he thought of the movie he replied It was OK. When I asked if he thought it was funny he replied Kind of. I guess. Not exactly a ringing endorsement but not a total condemnation either.";

I am not sure how many there were and I am too lazy to look but I have seen them all. The same things I liked about the originals I liked about this one. Same with the dislikes. I am able to suspend my disbelief only so far. However I do realize this movie is mainly for KIDS and I am able to let go of it's obvious flaws. I did like how Herbie was animated just a bit to show his personality just a little more.Ray Peyton Sr. Michael Keaton was a legendary racer and wants nothing more than his son Ray Peyton Jr. Breckin Meyer to be the Next Great Peyton. The only problem is that Jr. has a unique problem which causes him to crash for apparently no reason even when no one else is around. The other thing is Maggie Peyton Lindsay Lohan is the more gifted of Sr.'s children.After Maggie ends up with Herbie although she does not really want him at first he takes it upon himself to take on the current racing legend Trip Murphy Matt Dillon in a street race and beats him. This strikes a nerve with Trip who wants to ruin Herbie and his mysterious driver Max. Bet you can't figure out who Max is. Anyways the racing scenes are very similar to the racing scenes of the past movies. I am not sure but I believe the opening scenes were clips from past movies.Matt Dillon is excellent as the antagonist as he usually is. He plays the egotistical Trip in quite the humorous way. Also Lindsay Lohan was beautiful and perfect for the role. To be honest I may not have seen Herbie if she was not starring in it. Also Michael Keaton has visibly aged here and not in a very good way. Justin Long also puts in a fine performance as Kevin. Also I did not even realize I was watching a G Rated movie. I am not sure when the last time I saw one of those was but it was refreshing to be able to look back at the movie I just saw and not be able to come up with anything questionable about it.If you have seen any of the Herbie movies then you know whether or not you will like this one. Please don't be shocked if you have seen them and still choose to go see this movie. If you did not like it then it is entirely your fault. Maybe movies are too complicated for someone like that to enjoy. 710".

Against her father's wishes she winds up on the road to NASCAR her childhood dream and ends up competing with professional driver Trip Murphy.Familyoriented yarn is filled with music montages that resemble MTV videos of the 1980s and today's Disney Channel ones as well often to avoid using the film's allready corny dialogue and the most ridiculous clichfilled story one would ever think of. Many of the film's CGI look fake and cartoonish in comparison with those we're so accustomed to see in Star Wars Lord of the Rings and so forth.Hoever the movie still has some good qualities. Lindsay Lohan makes a relatively good performance in what is expected to be her last Disney film and former Caped Crusader Michael Keaton has surely changed over the years making him fit for the role of Lohan's father. The rest of the cast including Matt Dillon as the villain make the most of what the script gives them and it's good to see The Love Bug blinking and being naughty.The movie is not very good but it is not bad either it's sort of another average liveaction Disney movie. It is not as good as The Champions which is known as The Mighty Ducks in America but still an effective feelgood movie in the end and the movie is adequate for kids.

If at one time she sold her body on the streets of Rome partly as an act of rebellion against a failed marriage of convenience she now must resume the work to raise funds to pay off a threatening former pimp played by the cool charismatic Franco Citti while raising a few extra lira to get her son a few nice things on the side. She implores a priest to help her son find a decent job and does a host of other things to try and get Ettore away from the life of a hood.The problem is that her son is like she presumably was and is still capable of being  a rebellious angry child drawn to the street life. He also almost instinctively falls for a young whore who may or may not resemble his young mother.This is a great film.  Pasolini cares deeply for these characters.  Are Ettore and his mother a Madonna and Christ as sometime prostitute and would be criminal?  Perhaps.  Though their sins are not necessary for their survival their hardships and sufferings take on a religious martyred quality.  Mamma Roma is the lost heroic sinner of the Italian lower classes who can sometimes struggle to better themselves through respectable work faith and redemption.  But she can't do enough for herself and her son by being virtuous so she must turn to the street on occasion.  And either due to his environment or his temperament both products of his mother Ettore in all his youthful impatience and vigor can't resist the effortless ennui and easy thrills of hanging out with petty hoods stealing from whoever they can and dallying around with a young whore.Rome looks and feels like a prison in this film.  The city feels walled off by apartment buildings the entrance into which feels like the entrance into an ancient city  perhaps ancient Jerusalem.  Outside the modern buildings stand patches of ancient ruins.  Ettore lives his life among these overlooked neglected ruins which perhaps foreshadow his own future.  If this is to be his future it won't be because of a lack of love and effort on the part of Mama Roma instead it will be because of the neglect of the prison of Rome and because of his own wild bitter heart the heart of a boy for which Mama Roma would devote her life.".

	schema:headline " Anna Magnani is Magnificent in Pier Paolo Pasolini's Excellent Feature";
	schema:reviewBody "Mamma Roma1962 is one of the best films to come out of Italy during the 1960's.  Anna Magnani is terrific as a strong willed mother who wants to give her son a better future to look foward to by living in the city.  Its a homage to the neorealist classics of the late 40's and mid 50's.  In fact this film compares greatly with some of the early films by De Sica and Fellini.  Mamma Roma and his previous film added on another facet to the multi talented multiple artist Pier Paolo Pasolini.  The movie is filled with many political and religious ideas that the director believed in.Mamma Roma1962 deals with the themes of betrayal loneiness and class status.  The film has a nililistic feel to it when it comes to the youth of the story.  There are parts of this motion picture that reminded me of Luis Bunuel's Los Olvidados.  They both see the youth as people who have nothing to look foward to.  Its the opposite of a coming of age story because nothing positive happens to the teen protagonist.  The direction by Pasolini is well done as he showed that he was on his way to becoming one of the most important film makers in Italy during the late 20th Century.It contains some poetic moments.  Its a film that doesn't get much credit due to the bleak nature of the main characters.  Its this sense of hopelessness that turned many viewers off to this movie in 1962.  It was rereleased in its full version several years ago by Martin Scorsese' film company.  The film is a class study of people who try to escape their old ways only to be unsuccessful in the attempt to turn over a new leaf.  The art direction was done by future director Flavio Mogherini.Ettore Garofolo does a good job in the role of Ettore Mamma Roma's son. Anna Magnani is wonderful at alternating between motherly and sensual instincts.  In 1962 Mamma Roma was denounced by the police to the Magistrate's office for its portrayal of the young teens.  The case was eventually dismissed.  One scene that was good is the scene where Mamma Roma shows her son what's its like to be respectable.  Another memorable moment is the final shot of Magnani attempting to jump out the window.Ettore is presented as a martyr in the vein of a religious symbol.  His final scenes are both heart breaking and sad.  Although Mamma Roma is a prostitute she still in a awkward way has a moral consciousness that gradually develops throughout the movie.  Her ideology is developed through the mass media.  What's sad is that Mamma Roma does not realize that her ideals are corrupted until she feels that she has failed in her relationship with her son.  Pasolini believed that The only thing that makes man really great is the fact that he will die and Man's only greatness lies in his tragedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mamma Roma could be Pasolini's best film. Well perhaps I shouldn't judge that right now. I have seen two others Salo which I quite like despite its being the vilest film ever made and The Gospel According to Matthew generally considered his best film. I love that one as well. But as much as I loved those two films they didn't envelope me like Mamma Roma did.Anna Magnani plays the titular character an aging plump and earthy whore. Her pimp has retired and let her go so Mamma Ro' runs off to the country to gather up her teenage son. The backstory of the son is left obscure. Apparently Mamma Ro' left him with some relatives or something like that. Her son Ettore is excited to move to Rome but he is not sure whether he trusts his mother. She has abandoned him for most of his life presumably one of the great gifts that Pasolini has in this film is that he never spells anything out but just suggests  and implies a lot.The film shifts between Mamma Ro' and Ettore. Ro' is running a respectable fruit stand although she likes to hang around all of her friends who are still prostitutes and pimps. Probably the most memorable shot of the film occurs when Ro' walks down the streets of rural Rome at night. The camera moves backwards on a dolly and Ro' is constantly walking towards it. Her friends approach her talk with her and walk with her a while only to drop back. A few seconds later a new companion will walk up next to Ro' and walk beside her talk with her. There are actually two scenes with this shockingly beautiful technique used at strategic points of the film. Mamma Roma cares about her son more than anything. She is a good mother or at least she is overly determined to be one.Ettore on the other hand lives a life of boredom. School does not interest him nor does work. He would rather hang around with all the local hoodlums and the local tramp who lives down the street. He wanders around amongst the ruins of ancient Roman city walls. The landscape is simply beautiful but in a very desolate manner. As the film progresses Ettore grows more and more delinquent.The themes of mother and son are universal. Of making amends and of growing up. This film captures the feel of human existence as almost no other film does. Pasolini is a genius he has his fingers right on the pulse of human rhythm. I think that he captures what the neorealist directors were always after. They always got bogged down in melodrama although I do love a ton of them. Mamma Roma is the kind of film that makes me happy to be alive. It's not exactly a happy film but it is wonderfully life affirming. When Mamma Ro' rode proudly down the street on the back of her son's motorbike it left a mark on me never to be erased.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mamma Roma not released in the US until over thirty years after its original release in Italy has the ingredients of melodrama but is not filmed exactly in the way that should conjure the usual aesthetic. It's filmed like in a trance much of the time as its characters move along like they know what selfmade hell they're in and while it's not done in a semidocumentary way it doesn't exactly have the heightened sense of true urgency that a Rossellini film had either. The location sort of makes it in part a psychological crutch to live in the buildings and even the rural decay as being symbolic arguably of Roma and Ettore's rock and a hard place situation as well as their torn relationship. But what's captured best is the passion of the characters even if it's not exactly always well performed passion or expression and the hardened melancholy directed by the musical score.One of the best things Pasolini has going for him with his production is Anna Magnani as the title role. She's the kind of warmhearted prostitute that's become a clich in some films but she passes clich to make Mamma Roma a sublime array of what a hardbitten woman of 43 who's been working the streets her whole life since hitting pubescence and while she can have moments of tenderness and happiness and real abandon with odd hilarity i.e. that wedding scene at the beginning it's all very brief as if on a leash via pimp Carmine Citti. Magnani is to use a clich the heart and soul of the picture or at least the best kind as her intent for being compassionate for her son is undying even when she scorns him for doing nothing with his life. There's a great scene where she and Biancofiore a fellow prostitute watch Ettore at a waiter job and she breaks into tears for seemingly no reason but there is a reason for how simple but effectively Pasolini shows Ettore being really innocent and pure at work even childlike in his demeanor.And if Ettore played by an actor with the same name in his first movie role not to be cruel but you can tell is sort of twodimensional as an angry and dysfunctional and aimless youth after women and money but with no direction at all is an intriguing weak link Pasolini and DP Tonino DelliColli's skills at filming everything is topnotch. In fact I'd say even having only seen a few of Pasolini's movies to be a very important film for him as director. He has a care in filming what are conventional scenes like a wedding via closeups naturally and in church scenes and even with a specific shot of Rome used more than once to establish and with a beautiful ease in tracking shots along the streets and empty fields that is in fact poetic in tone. Best of all as other critics have noted are the nighttime walking scenes where Magnani walks along in front of the camera the lights behind making it sort of ominous and evocative at once with one man coming into talk and then leaving and then another woman or man coming in as Magnani walks and talks like it's the most natural thing in the world. Simply put they're some of the most beautiful moments in 60's Italian film.As the film rolls along to the extraordinarily depressing ending leading to a scene in a solitary prison cell with a character tied down to a bed with a horrible fever the music also becomes a fascinating asset. It's hit and miss with how Pasolini utilizes Vivaldi in the film sometimes with the soft and super sad notes being played in moments that aren't quite necessary i.e. Ettore just idly strolling along by himself it might be more effective without while other times with a very cool power i.e. the pimp walking down the road almost in a Morricone mood. But in these final scenes the music splendidly complements the doomed nature of the mother and son as whatever momentary hope is moot for what the environment has to offer which is all the same over and over. It's a very good film if not a great one about characters unable to surpass the dregs and just annoyances of the society for Roma the customers and pimp for Ettore his gang of friends and it should be considered a mustsee for fans of Italian film. 8.510".

	schema:headline " Unforgettable Pasolini";
	schema:reviewBody "Strong and tragic movie with an amazing Anna Magnani as the brokendown woman who fight for a dignified life in the slum of Rome. Uncompromising social realism and no one could like Pasolini use music as a consequent commentary to the themes in the film. In his movies the music is not isolated to the specific scene but always to the film as a hole.

Uncompromising social realism and no one could like Pasolini use music as a consequent commentary to the themes in the film. In his movies the music is not isolated to the specific scene but always to the film as a hole.

She brings him to Rome and enables him to enroll to a school with the money that she earned from prostitution. She buys an apartment in one of the better Roman neighborhoods and starts her new business as a greengrocer. However Ettore feels lost in the big city to which he is not used and joins a gang of youngsters around the beautiful Bruna with whom he falls in love. Since he cannot bring up enough money to buy gifts for her he starts to steal even items from the household of his mother. When Mamma Roma gets wind from that she takes him from the school and organizes him a job as waiter. At the same time she tries to turn him away from Bruna by sending him to a former colleague of her. The misery is perfect when Mamma Roma's old pimp turns up again and demands from her to prostitute herself again since otherwise he wants to tell her son that his mother is a whore. Desperately she goes back to her old profession in the evenings but it does not help Bruna tells Ettore everything. Here his breakdown starts he quits work and is from now on a professional streetrobber. When he and his colleagues rob patients in a hospital Ettore is caught in flagranti by the police and brought into a psychiatric clinic where he dies.The German psychiatrist and writer Dr. Oskar Panizza wrote towards the end of the 19th century a story entitled The 'Trinity' Inn. This very special inn in Southern Germany is hold by an old man who speaks Hebrew a blond thin asthmatic youth named Christus and his mother a once good looking woman named Mary whose profession is that of a whore. A very similar familiar constellation appears in Panizza's The Council of Love which has been filmed by Werner Schroeter in 1982. It would be very interesting to know if Pasolini knew Panizza's work since without any doubt at least for people who know Pasolini's work we find in the figures of Mamma Roma the Virgin Mary in Ettore Christ in Carmine the pimp St. Joseph and most probably in Bruna the character of Maria Magdalena exactly this role the actress Bruna  Silvana Corsini had played one year before in Pasolini's Accattone. What we therefore have in front of us is a wonderfully perverted Holy Family in the suburbs of Rome.".

	schema:reviewBody "You'll be his first kiss his first love his first friend You are his momma And he is your whole world I have selected this motherson verse for my review because it seems to accurately correspond to this movie's core idea. As one of the first features by Italy's controversial yet versatile talent Pier Paolo Pasolini MAMMA ROMA is a movie which remains strongly in the memory of the viewer due to as a New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther pointed out its bottomless well of emotions its sensuality and dark iconoclasm. Nothing is black and white everything is highly complex more to say CONTRADICTORY. Having so many ideas blended mixed out of place the film is an altogether shocking experience. While Pasolini's other films may occur too bizarre and feverish Crowther for some viewers this one is actually a striking combination of the director's perversion and genius.As much as MAMMA ROMA may be considered a descendant of Italian Neorealism being an almost 'successor' or 'sequence' to Rossellini's ROMA CITTA APERTA additionally the presence of Lamberto Maggiorani echoes DeSica's masterpiece BICYCLE THIEVES uttering his only word in the movie  al ladro it is an unpredictable surprising mixture of the classic and the modern the Greek 'cosmos' vs. 'chaos' and a board for Renaissance painting baroque music classical literature mystical Catholicism and Freudian psychoanalysis. Something that perhaps only Pasolini was able to do without the finale of 'scandalous rage' and oblivion.' In the title itself the city of Rome the locale of the story different from its ancient power and arrogance from its medieval capital of pilgrim destination from its 1945 crisis the Rome of 1962 is satirically personified by a prostitute almost on the verge of blasphemy with an association with Salus Populi Romani  Madonna in Santa Maria Maggiore called by some 'Mamma di Roma'. But she is not Fellini's Cabiria though there are certain parallels particularly in the desire of change but far more a mother title Mamma Roma played brilliantly by Anna Magnani.Although much could be said about this blended aspect of literaryartisticmusicalreligious sources all of which Pasolini himself personified  the aspect that is nicely developed by Jim's FilmWebsite where he discusses Vivaldi concerto in the scenes of emotional tension along with Leonardo da Vinci frescoes of madly inappropriate Biblical references  referring to Crowther's words for that reason another review would be necessary. In the context of art the director of photography Tonino Delli Colli deserves full credit making some scenes look almost magically meaningful. But as this requires more in depth analysis let me focus more on this title character or more two characters that make the whole film an emotional and psychological feast. They foremost make the film worth seeing.ANNA MAGNANI All tensions somehow meet their realization in the immensely meaningful yet complex persona of Mamma Roma. When she sings she sings with joy when she plays she plays with passion when she looks at us her eyes tell everything. Although there were many roles in her life this is actually the most appealing one. Initially not very enthusiastic about the role the vibrant contrast and absorbing vitality results. I would agree with Jim's article that her performance is earthy and passionate ... simultaneously hilarious and tragic realistic and stylized. Apart from the enormous bags under her eyes she plunges herself into the story as hardly anyone else as a mother and a prostitute. Who can forget her brilliant confessions to all people around in the nocturnal streets of Rome or her final tragedy. But we cannot analyze her alone. She is fully realized along with her son Ettore a boy bitten by the lizard of his mother's past and the lizard of money and destructive greed. ETTORE GAROFOLO embodies wandering youth wandering puberty being constantly in search of something. With his fellows he is like one of the Apostles from IL VANGELO SECONDO MATTEO alone he is Pasolini's world in itself. Inspired by Caravaggio's Boy Bitten By a Lizard he is both pure manifestation of Pasolini's view of a young man along with his immensely appraised maturing sexuality as well as a product of psychoanalytical aspects. In him the struggle is the stimulus and response the source and the goal the mother as a haunting love a haunting desire and a girl Bruna as freedom of escape. And yet she is still a product of his mind and inner almost subconscious sphere. Contrast evokes the one of spirituality in the glimpse of Madonna and carnality in the glimpse of the girl's breasts the contrast between fresh nature and old ruins  fresh air among the old heyday. He blends the carnal and the spiritual the joys and suffering. In one of the most memorable scenes with the superior camerawork when the boy remains within his own frame he talks to his mother who sits like a harlot...later he talks to Bruna the Evelike creature from the Garden of Eden. The much appreciated tango scene is a climax of the Oepidus complex. Mind you that in his final agony which echoes another Neorealist masterpiece PAISA but foremost Andrea Mantegna's painting Ettore addresses his mother conclusively the one he has loved most. Solely in that relation we can embrace Bosley Crowther's words that the story imprisons its characters in a world of temptation.When Ettore dies he resembles Christ by the echoing power of Mantegna's masterful painting. Here the boy of one name becomes the implicit protagonist of the movie. Our attention is surely drawn to him. But also something dies in Mamma Roma in her Pietalike agony because she is his momma and he is her whole world. Strange and uncommon as this pious reference may seem Pasolini makes this conclusion a universal appeal of feelings that more powerfully than radiantly speak of their universal religiosity and spirituality but above all humanity.".

Anna Magnani's charismatic character is one of the guests at the ceremony. She is among the less reserved people at the tables and throughout the film she'll take the spotlight especially when it's not her turn. We are people who work land says an old man whom Signora Roma interrupts by claiming his words are dreadfully boring. Is she drunk? No as I'll learn to know she's a hilarious middleaged prostitute laughing out loud whenever she pleases at whomever she meets no matter what it is. She can joke about everything but when she is all alone she wears a concerned and serious grin on her face. Life is not sweet it is a struggle in poorly constructed suburbs. Long live bride and groom is Signora Roma's last words before she shuts up after winning a singing duel with the groom with great success. Mamma Roma likes music and music is playing this film forward. Melancholic and passionate music by Cherubini on the soundtrack during opening credits suggest I'm about to watch something of certain vitality and spiritually concerned. Fact is Pasolini's film feels reminiscent of a Mexicoperiod Luis Buuel film. Less violent of course but more contemplative in some ways as Pasolini lets impressions sink before moving on with life in the outskirts of Roma.Mamma Roma and her 18 year old son Ettore reunites after a long time. I like how Pasolini establish the mother and son relationship by showing Signora Roma put on a tango record and learn her son to dance properly. At your age the only woman you need is a mother. Ettore has never had a girlfriend and never knew his own father. In Fellini's bittersweet film 'La Notti Di Cabiria' money is the root to all evil and as Giulietta Masina's character will experience that real love can't be bought. Can't go anywhere without money sighs one of Ettore's buddies. Signora Roma express her love to her son by buying him a motorcycle so that he can drive around and find himself work. Ettore is torn between his mother and teenage buddies who are looking for kicks and hums Elvis Presley. Many teenagers can relate to these dilemmas and I remember how difficult it sometimes was and perhaps still is to listen to yourself when everyone's got something to say about you. Anna Magnani plays Ettore's mother with headstrong confidence. Everyone have always liked me she tells her son proudly and when Ettore begins an affair with one of the local girls Bruna her mother turns protective and very aggressive. Ettore sells the record player in order to buy Bruna a necklace but the relationship is doomed to be shortlived. I don't care if my boy run after a crazy girl. I can get rid of her if I put my mind to it. Although Mamma Roma is not the reason why Ettore's relationship with Bruna ends.Mamma Roma and Ettore's relationship parallels with religion. Inside the cathedral it's a different world than out on the streets. At mass Signora Roma has her mind on everything else than God. Signora Roma worships her son calling him an angel and the next Sunday she plots a trick on a wealthy bureaucrat with another prostitute while listening to the priest. The thing is Ettore's mother is so busy with earning a living that her thoughts are always on him but her work is physically keeping them apart. Pasolini is questioning why we put faith in a Messiah as well as arguing for a view on life directed by God as something worth living for. In the end it is the son who is praying to Mamma Roma she is unable to reach his hand for help as his clothes are left in his empty room his body is chained to wood and a fever is tiring him down. You don't know yet what an awful place the world can be.".

	schema:reviewBody "An author and filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini forged a body of work that painted a bleak uncompromised portrait of the human condition. His breakthrough picture Mamma Roma exemplified his worldview. With Mamma Roma the auteur's sophomore effort Pasolini addressed the false promise of Roman life through a stark examination of a subproletariat family's breakdown. The film opens with a harsh metaphor for the principal's state as the image of swine eating and rooting in pig manure widens out to reveal a wedding party. From frame one we are immediately steeped in one of European cinema's truest and most unforgiving portraits of broken hungry lives. As the opening scene unfolds the titular character  played by Anna Magnani  feeds the hogs and harasses the bride and groom her brash mouth braying a laugh that functions more as a psychological salve than a genuine response to the world around her. She taunts the bride asserting that the pigs are speaking to her and one has confessed to being a whore. Here the director establishes a foreboding symbol so overt it becomes subtle as Mamma Roma herself is revealed to be a lady of the evening in the sequence that follows. And when the groom Mamma Roma's former husband bride and Mamma Roma herself improvise musical wedding toasts with lyrics that become progressively harsher and more revealing a powerful yet oblique metaphor for the grandiloquence of peasant suffering takes form. Thus Pasolini establishes early on that the film will inhabit the world of the hick  the milieu of the starving  and the concept of the peasant's illfated pursuit of edification grows organically out of these opening scenes. When the next sequence begins Mamma Roma reconnects with an estranged teenage son. Here Pasolini establishes a sublime melancholy image of institutional social stagnation as we are introduced to young Ettore Ettore Garofalo riding a carousel. The mundane nature of the carnival ride subtly reflects all of the characters' lack of mobility  they will inevitably return to where they began. The circular nature of despair is further explored through Mamma Roma's sojourns to the track a row for ladies of the evening where she previously moonlighted as a prostitute. The sequence features our protagonist taking a circular route around the row conversing with the brethren she's self deluded enough to feel are beneath her. Her journey mirrors her trajectory throughout the film she begins the story a beleaguered whore and in spite of the most fervent of efforts concludes the same. Thus Pasolini effectively illustrates a theme consistent in his work the inevitability of failure. It is the titular character's hidden self that once revealed completes Ettore's disillusionment. When introduced he is a young tough content to roam the back streets with his equally aimless friends. The search for a score another bit of foreshadowing as a score is what eventually leads to his institutionalization supplants any real material pursuit. Yet Mamma Roma's false promise of a better life serves more to suffocate the young man than embolden him. This dichotomy is established when young Ettore is first taken to his mother's apartment. A strong undercurrent of sexual tension permeates the tango scene  a sequence in which Mamma Roma and Ettore dance to the ironically titled Italian folk song Gypsy Violin. Her coquettish wiles and close effusive body language reveal the incestuous nature of her affection as well as Ettore's understandable sense of emotional suffocation. The incest motif is further underscored when Ettore becomes infatuated with a fickle young mother. Mamma Roma seeks to diffuse his affection by having a colleague seduce and deflower him. Here Mamma Roma's yearnings crystallize as she literally assigns a surrogate to copulate with the young pimp. Pasolini's use of incest can be viewed as clever and uncompromised as it is both a symbol of circular entrapment and a metaphor for the manner in which desolate generations subjugate each other in the service of their needs. In this respect sexuality bares the same weight as economic or emotional factors. Thus in Mamma Roma all needs are satisfied within the perverse symbiosis of dysfunction. The story concludes as a fait e' compli. After Mamma Roma's previous husband reappears a plot point that symbolically underscores the impossibility of selfgentrification the man is literally the past come back for a reckoning young Ettore discovers his mother's past and embarks on another score. The target a hospital for the aged previously alluded to in the story constitutes Pasolini's most apocalyptic metaphor. The cold pale walls and rows of old men filed away until they die reflect the state of the indigent that populate the story. The patients exist as Ettore is destined to. At the denouement the young man lays strapped to a wooden table a literal manifestation of his psychosocial imprisonment. Hence the director has created a portrait of an impoverished class trapped in behavior patterns that are incestuous and selfhypnotizing. Mamma Roma constitutes a hopeless vision of humanity unequaled in the Pasolini cannon until his final film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Definitely a mixed bag. While for once we are given a Pasolini character with some charisma and emotions we can identify with it is also true Magnani's grande dame performance seriously unbalances the picture. Her regularly timed eruptions of gaspingclutchinghersides belly laughter no doubt signifiers of her earthiness often seem as disconcerting and mystifying to her costars as they do to the viewer. On the other hand her quieter scenes expressing her alternate anxiety and grasping love for her son are quite convincing. Most impressive of all are the two nightime setpieces where Magnani walks in extended takes down seemingly desolate Roman streets almost nothing aside from street lamps is visible and is in turn joined and then abandoned by various other creatures of the night. All these people  mainly prostitutes and their clients and various other partiers  are plainly familiar with Mamma Ro and it is here that Magnani's operatic performance style actually fits the situation showing her behavior as a defense against personal entanglements and the impingeing emptiness of the night. Pasolini is able to comunicate not only her ease and familiarity with this world and her alternate sense of cosmic aloneness in it but a resonate sense of the moral disruption and decay he saw as prominent in that society. Pasolini makes powerful use of his settings throughout the movie. The ancient and fragile ruins giving a sense both of our increasingly tenuous connection with the past and the impermanence of the current structure of things. The use of wide often abandoned streets with the camera tracking backward  in front of  or forward  also in front of  the characters. We thus get the feeling of a force pulling the characters from one place andor pushing them to another. A sense of the operation of fate perhaps? The cluster of apartment buildings also effectively communicates a sense of Rome or the modern city as a prison  especially in the final shot.A couple of other notes Ettore Garofalo is entirely believable as the sullen swaggering sometimes awkward son. As for Pasolini's intrusive and heavyhanded religious symbolism it doesn't overwhelm the inherent drama of the story or our involvement until the final 1015 minutes. This in stark contrast to all of his films after THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW. In short this most dated of 60's experimentalists seems pretty fresh here. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the main things I noticed about Pier Paolo Pasolini's 1962 film is how many similarities it has with Fellini's 'Nights of Cabiria' which was made five years earlier.Not least of all the feisty Anna Magnani as the 40 something whore of the title nicknamed presumably after her reputation as the best working woman in the city. There's also the fact that she desperately wants to retire set up a fruit and veg stall and finally get to know her teenage son.Then there's the modern on 'the edge of town' highrise flats and wasteland that borders flanks them. Many Italian directors of the day used such locations presumably as they were easy to film on and probably didn't require the expense and redtape of getting permission to film in the City centre. But those landscapes show a universal sort of hinterland between poverty and modernism and their ugly sparseness helps concentrate on the human figures we're watching.Giuletta Masina as the protagonist Fellini's wife then in comparison also tries to retire but her romantic ideals go astray and she just heads for heartache whilst Mamma Rosa wants to see the son that his father never saw and she feels guilty over her neglect of him and wants him to steer a course away from the way she has lived.Unfortunately these ideals slip a little her persistent pimp notwithstanding as she relies more and more on using her rather dodgy contacts and past liaisons to achieve that. Sickly as a young child Ettore Ettore Garofolo is frankly not a handsome lad and when he gets to know a local girl who doesn't quite meet his mother's high ideals she asks another much younger and prettier callgirl to introduce him to women for the first time if you get my drift and of course she wants to get him a job....talk about a mother's love for a child being blind!Pasolini's approach is rather less dramatic and theatrical than Fellini's but is probably more consistent and it's more straightforward. You just have to love Mamma's offbeat approach to life though not everybody does in the film which is both amusing and entertaining. I understand that the cast were all amateur apart from Anna Magnani as was common with films from the Italian neorealist movement and this makes it all the more natural and believable.I noticed that Pasolini employed some lovely steady camera shots like with a Steadicam slowly moving along streets which gives a graceful fluidity adding to an often poetic poise. However the emotional buttons don't get pushed quite as hard or readily as with the Fellini comparison but it's still an enjoyable film that certainly adds to the list of notable Italian films of the 50s and 60s.If you enjoy the straighter side of Fellini such as La Dolce Vita or any that depicts Rome in a contemporary way then you'll enjoy this too. The 'Mr Bongo' release has a decent transfer with pretty good sound. A few subtitling spelling gremlins are just noticeable but never spoil the viewing pleasure.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film two days ago for the first time and it was my introduction to the work of Pier Paolo Pasolini. Mamma Roma is a sad realistic and amazing film about a woman who knows how cruel and difficult is the life in the street but she can't communicate her experiences to her son because of her dark past. Mamma Roma Anna Magnani was a prostitute in the streets of Roma until she could finally afford a place to live and to help her only son Ettore Ettore Garofolo who was living in the countryside. She has a lot of desires to help her son but her past wasn't a good example for Ettore and he can't understand in those days that his mother did that because she never knew other place but the street. With Ettore's first contact with the street in Roma he felt in love with a girl and started to make easy money with some of his friends. And that's when Mamma Roma lose all of her hopes because she may think that the son of a woman like her could never have a good life. In the end the phrase We may be through with the past but the past ain't through with us is perfect for Mamma Roma.About the cast all the performances are great mostly with actors who's only work is this film. Anna Magnani steals the film with a memorable and powerful performance of Mamma Roma. She will make you feel the character.Conclusion Mamma Roma is a very powerful film with a very realistic story about the love of a mother. According to Wikipedia this film was banned in the United States for almost thirty three years so it's great that the film is right now available because is a gem that you will love. 9.5 out of 10Region 4 DVD this film is in the collection of the company Zima Chronicles of the Italian Cinema with many Italian classics. I remember that some months ago I get the DVD of 8 for a regular price but now since the collection hasn't a good response every DVD price is around 4 to 6. I'm not surprised because in Mexico films from Europe are very difficult to sale that's why in the commercial theaters there are only American films. Anyway the DVD is good and for that price is much better.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this film two days ago for the first time and it was my introduction to the work of Pier Paolo Pasolini. Mamma Roma is a sad realistic and amazing film about a woman who knows how cruel and difficult is the life in the street but she can't communicate her experiences to her son because of her dark past. Mamma Roma Anna Magnani was a prostitute in the streets of Roma until she could finally afford a place to live and to help her only son Ettore Ettore Garofolo who was living in the countryside. She has a lot of desires to help her son but her past wasn't a good example for Ettore and he can't understand in those days that his mother did that because she never knew other place but the street. With Ettore's first contact with the street in Roma he felt in love with a girl and started to make easy money with some of his friends. And that's when Mamma Roma lose all of her hopes because she may think that the son of a woman like her could never have a good life.

The film opens with a riotous prequel at the wedding of a pimp to another woman with his two year old son in attendance... the boy's mother played by Ms. Magnani enters with gift piglets dressed up like guests... it's an hilarious dinner party with singing too.... then 12 years later we go up the stairs passed the loitering kids to a seedy apartment on the outskirts of town overlooking a graveyard? The landscape of mystic old and sterile new  vacant lots separating housing developments  is a view to be found in many Italian films of the 60's...In the apartment on a high floor with a view the teenage son and mother talk and tango then the pimp returns to knock on the door... he needs her to earn a sum for him so he begs her to return to the streets when she was just about to get her son out of there... Apparently she bought an apartment in a development within Rome where people own businesses and even give a churchgoing appearance of respectability but before moving there she has to work another two weeks. Here's where you'll see a continuously moving and incomparable beautiful nighttime street walk... The shot begins at the moment she's earned enough money and she's bidding a fond addio to the street... She takes us on a night walk on the big plaza with people entering in and out of the frame during her monologue story of her marriage at 14... This is a miraculous segment that happens in one continuous shot... She describes her childhood marriage and the listeners only catch a part of it... only the movie viewer gets to hear it all... Unfortunately she has to go back to that plaza later in the film...more amazing night walks. Pasolini follows her with a moving light... the dotted electric lights of rome surround her... it's immeasurable how moving this scene is and what a cinematic accomplishment it is... the film is in real time segments... The detail are easily referential. The full view they impart to the viewer are so much greater than the film's running time... anyway the imbalance of upwardly mobile survival and adolescent development does in her son... He's bound to a bed. The camera is positioned at a low angle for a view that runs up his body to his head. Her neighbors and colleagues are pretty heartless to her but when she goes running off after hearing about her son's death ... you can bet we all follow say no don't go. WE LOVE YOU ANNA MAGNANI!".

The camera shots angles and lighting are superb the dialog is genuine and the plot line is believable. But this is not runofthemill Hollywood fare. There is no seamless stream of canned emotional music to fill in the gaps for underactive imaginations. There are no handydandy humor scenes for fluffy feelgood filling. There are no flat characters to artificially ease the main character into some orchestrated epiphany. There isn't even really a hero. There is only a man who is trying to live as best as he can in a selfserving world a man who finds a measure of strength even as he runs from his fears. In order to truly appreciate the message that this movie has to offer you have to think outside of your comfortable moviewatching box. This movie is gritty powerful and raw. This movie makes no excuses. This movie is about as close as the big screen can get to portraying real life. No it's not a pleasant movie. Neither is life.".

My question is why doesn't this make it a bad film? And to make one last comparison this film way out did anything 8 Mile attempted much more of a social critique.The strength in this film is derived from it's black and white presentation of the dope game and how for fifty it was either sleep in a cellar or buy a Mercedes. Sheridan did a good depiction of how selling drugs is an easy escape a way to make you feel like a man. The best and most powerful scene in this film is when someone slips a razor blade in his solitary cell in order for him to kill himself. He remarks I thought about it. I also enjoyed the nonromanticized violence and how the drug game was not altogether glorified.The downfall of this film is it's over dramatized scenes and it may be a little to long however a good critique of Black Urban society and well worth your 8 dollars.".

And to make one last comparison this film way out did anything 8 Mile attempted much more of a social critique.The strength in this film is derived from it's black and white presentation of the dope game and how for fifty it was either sleep in a cellar or buy a Mercedes. Sheridan did a good depiction of how selling drugs is an easy escape a way to make you feel like a man. The best and most powerful scene in this film is when someone slips a razor blade in his solitary cell in order for him to kill himself. He remarks I thought about it. I also enjoyed the nonromanticized violence and how the drug game was not altogether glorified.The downfall of this film is it's over dramatized scenes and it may be a little to long however a good critique of Black Urban society and well worth your 8 dollars.";

Let's get one thing straight. If you hate 50 so much that you cant even write a partial review on this movie don't review it. Im not fond of 50 as a rapper and as a person but that is a lousy reason to give this movie bad reviews. Get Rich Or Die Trying is loosely based on the life of Curtis Jackson and based on that reason its pretty good. 50 plays himself and there are good performances from Terrance Howard as well as Joy Bryant who plays 50's girlfriend in the movie. Bill Duke is pretty good as the boss of the organization 50 links up with. The movie covers his childhood as well is how he became to be a rapper. One might question the authenticity of the story being told in this moviethis being the movie's real flaw but as far as entertainment goes I enjoyed myself.Its a shame when people allow the nutswallowing groupies that run amok on IMDb dictate to you what is quality movies. These weirdos think that defending movies that were rightfully panned like Freddy Got Fingered Nothing But Trouble Batman and Robin The Musketeer The Black Dahlia makes them hip and cool and not pathetic posers in dire need of a life. And as far as acting goes last time I checked Sylvester Stallone Arnold Schwarzenegger Leonardo Dicaprio Brad Musty Arm Pittoverrated beyond belief Chuck Norris are not real actors! To all of you reasonable people out there do not allow the circus freaks on IMDb to tell you what counts for quality cinema because you will be disappointed every time. There are a lot of great movies that never made the Top 250. Just goes to show you the bandwagon mentality of these pseudo intellectual rodents. And as far as the sheep go I wouldn't waste time trying to reason with you. I'd rather beat you senseless when I see you in public you gutless cowards! Go fawn over the eversooverrated Quentin Tarantino like the spineless groupies you are.PS to the token that apologized online for 50 Cent instead of writing an actual review on the movie grow some sack will ya?

The acting will either make you gouge out your eyes or shove a sharp object in one ear and out the otherI left early to prevent such an occurrence. Worse yet 50 is the narrator and let's just say he's no Morgan Freeman. The plot will go from bad to worse to a steaming pile. The writer of this movie should go back to school and learn how to make a decent movie. The childhood scenes shouldn't have been added they just deter from the rest of the movie and waste a whole of time. Some of the lines in this movie are so bad that you will want to laugh out loud. Things you should do with your money before going to see this movieGet a gallon and a half worth in gas. Eat your money. Give it away to a homeless person. Wipe your beep with your money.

To say that 50 can't act is to say he can't be himself which is nonsense. I liked most of the other characters and hated the ones portraying the bad guys. I could feel 50's helplessness when his mother was murdered and really felt sad about his situation but I also applauded him for standing behind her right or wrong and his inner strength which shines throughout the movie.All in all this is a great movie for anyone who appreciates a true story that's well done. It's too sad that the world is full of immature and hateful people who can't stand it that anyone else could make something out of their life starting from nothing. It's even sadder that their allowed to comment here when there views are so bigoted and childish.

	schema:headline " Great Gangsta Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all I'd like to say that this movie is not 8 Mile or Hustle  Flow. This is not the kind of movie that shows how a rapper makes his music. If it was people would be complaining about how it was another Hustle  Flow. I think that people are saying the plot is too common because there have been a slew of rap movies out lately. This movie crosses genres and really should be considered more of a gangster film. Besides if people were tired of the same story then why is there another Pride  Prejudice remake? What stories have been told that have not already been told? It's in the quality of filmmaking and how the movie is done that separates it from the rest.This is the semiautobiographical story of Curtis Jackson. As such it is a success. It has tones more reminiscent of Scarface in that it shows a gangster's rise to power. Unlike most films in the gangster genre the gangster does not die in the end. And why should he? As a social commentary I think Sheridan is trying to say that this is what is idealized in a capitalistic American society. In a world where Justice can screw you I think Sheridan is saying it takes a very confident manan artist with a sense of what it takes to be an entrepreneur hard work luckwho can survive through all that hardship. A man who knows himself and accepts his past will be a success.The ending is sort of anticlimactic but it has a right to be. This movie is not really about success due to violence or gang ties but about gaining a sense of oneself and rising above all the crime and chaos to a profound sense of individual freedom. Marcus is not afraid to face the world exactly as he is in the end shown by his taking off his bulletproof vest at his concert.50 Cent is Young Caesar nicknamed Marcus. He is the head of a new rap empire and most people are afraid of those with power and success. That's why modern society has coined the term hater. Marcus was born on the Fourth of July an American holiday that epitomizes independence. The birthdeath of Marcus montage is so powerful.People coming into the movie without trying to gain a sense of the underlying themes that Terrence Winter and Jim Sheridan have brought to the movie are depriving themselves of a great piece of work. I think that they tried to imbue the movie with a sense of something more than just senseless violence and music video rap scenes. The writer and the director obviously put much thought into the making of this movie. They talk about how hustling is like making minimum wage the search for a lost father and how respect in the hood is measured by life experience and occasionally your shoes. I mean look at all the women out there who parade namebrand purses. Everyone wants to climb the social ladder garner respect and have something to show for social status. You can relate to the story if your from the hood or not.At least one person has experienced at least one of the struggles that Marcus goes through.I was very pleased by 50 Cent's acting. He basically embodies the rough hood gangster with his confident body language and square jaw. If you look all his emotion lies in his eyes. Trained to show no emotion because love with get you killed I think that the vulnerability that lies in his eyes and the powerful raw emotion that shines through is a skill that cannot be taught. Sure Terrence Howard is a great actorbut he's had time to refine his skills. As a debut film for 50 Cent I think he was excellent. I think Sheridan did a good job of pulling a wonderful performance out of 50 Cent. The most emotional scenes for me were the confrontation between Charlene  Marcus over life morphine and their son and the meeting between Marcus and his father in jail shortly after his hospitalization.This film definitely has many layers to it and I will watch it again to pick out the subtleties I may have missed the first time I saw it. Don't let bad critical reviews hinder you from seeing or enjoying the movie because most of those people seem to have already slated it in the negative before even watching it. Jim Sheridan has an obvious respect for both 50 Cent and rap music and I think that movie reviewers should do the same before passing on Get Rich or Die Trying'.".

They talk about how hustling is like making minimum wage the search for a lost father and how respect in the hood is measured by life experience and occasionally your shoes. I mean look at all the women out there who parade namebrand purses. Everyone wants to climb the social ladder garner respect and have something to show for social status. You can relate to the story if your from the hood or not.At least one person has experienced at least one of the struggles that Marcus goes through.I was very pleased by 50 Cent's acting. He basically embodies the rough hood gangster with his confident body language and square jaw. If you look all his emotion lies in his eyes. Trained to show no emotion because love with get you killed I think that the vulnerability that lies in his eyes and the powerful raw emotion that shines through is a skill that cannot be taught. Sure Terrence Howard is a great actorbut he's had time to refine his skills. As a debut film for 50 Cent I think he was excellent. I think Sheridan did a good job of pulling a wonderful performance out of 50 Cent. The most emotional scenes for me were the confrontation between Charlene  Marcus over life morphine and their son and the meeting between Marcus and his father in jail shortly after his hospitalization.This film definitely has many layers to it and I will watch it again to pick out the subtleties I may have missed the first time I saw it. Don't let bad critical reviews hinder you from seeing or enjoying the movie because most of those people seem to have already slated it in the negative before even watching it. Jim Sheridan has an obvious respect for both 50 Cent and rap music and I think that movie reviewers should do the same before passing on Get Rich or Die Trying'.";

I mean seriously Hollywood could have done better than to give 50 Cent his own movie. Hell his music is OK would never buy an album though but as an actor he was better at comedy than drama cause face it its funny to see him try to act. and the worse part about his acting is that he said it wasn't hard acting cause it brought him back to his roots and how he was well hell if it wasn't that hard than maybe you shouldn't have seem like you were overacting and just act normal. I know a camera is there but its not hard to forget about it. Eminem did a hell of a lot better job in '8 Mile' then Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson did here. I'm telling you to spend your 10 bucks to see 'Derailed' rather than this piece that should go back to the stacks.".

Some months ago it turned up on latenight Italian TV and I took the opportunity to tape the broadcast having watched the film now I can say that MOTHERS HEART is nothing like what I expected it to be! Indeed its most unusual  and the whole is rendered even stranger by Morricones fantastic and intricate compositions the protagonist is a divorced mother Carla Gravina still bestknown perhaps for playing the possessed lead in THE ANTICHRIST 1974 of three who may or may not be a mute were never actually told but the fact remains that she doesnt utter a single word during the course of the film and yet people around her seem to act as if awaiting her reply! While the children are cared for by a cantankerous old maid she works at a bookshop  however the heroines also involved somehow with a group of revolutionaries. Incidentally the kids are far more knowledgeable than their years in the very opening scene theyre engaged in professional tattooing on each other!  the eldest in particular is himself keen on politics and biochemistry hes obsessed with firing a rocket it was amusing but at the same time weird to hear him accuse his three yearold sibling of being a Communist which the latter vehemently denies! And it seems that the precociousness of Gravinas children is not an isolated case either as another mother seeking new reading material at the bookshop for her kid who she says is over the traditional Childrens Classics such as Treasure Island and Around The World In 80 Days is suggested De Sades Justine since its the story of a little orphan girl! Things get even more out of hand as the mother drifts farther away from her job eventually being sacked and duty at home into outright terrorism the kids come up with their own violent games  first by killing their pet cat when as passenger of the rocket during its test flight the launch backfires and the rocket explodes then when the toddler is tragically drowned in the bathtub! During the funeral also attended by the father  an underused Philippe Leroy  and his new companion whos actually good friends with Gravina! the eldest son sadistically reads aloud from an encyclopedia the effects of such a terrible death. Later on after the remaining kids spend some time with Dad only to embarrass him in front of guests by playing a clandestine recording of his lovemaking the night before! the sister also perishes at the hands of her intellectual sibling via a deliberate leakage of gas  which hes personally able to endure by wearing a selfconstructed gas mask!! The mother then is forced to take stock of the situation left alone with the boy  who actually blames her for the two previous deaths not an entirely unfounded accusation given her chronic aloofness  she blows him up while hes fiddling yet again with the rocket! After this its back to the revolution  except that her former companions have started to disperse however by now the heroines learned how to assemble a bomb by herselfwith the obvious target being her exhusbands pharmaceutical factory! Im sure that even from the above synopsis one is able to grasp just how bizarre this film is for the record the only other Samperi effort Id watched was THANK YOU AUNT 1968  which was itself fairly disturbing in view of the incestuous sadomasochistic central relationship and a finale promoting euthanasia! Apart from Morricones delightful contribution frequently providing ironic counterpoint to the onscreen events the anchor here is clearly Gravina  despite the inherent difficulty in playing a character whos basically a cipher incidentally her rapport with the kids is genuine since the elder couple are the actress reallife offsprings! Besides the film contains a surreal quality to it  which is positively winningthough its all eventually worn down by the excessive political rallying.".

	schema:reviewBody "A hollow life is observed clinically but sympathetically in this melancholy graceful film which is itself hollow but compelling like the dance beat it is set to. The director uses a convention I hadn't seen since early silent films a summary description of an action followed by its acting out. Also the story is narrated from a time yet to come. These devices create the sense that the events have happened beforeas they have in the cyclical purposeless life we are witnessingand also that they are inevitable. The story is narrated in the voice of the leading character but in the third person an older self from a real future? or an alternate reality? or only her imagination? The narration is necessary as a comment on the characters' behavior because in the numb and mindless hedonism that draws them in and keeps drawing them she keeps leaving the boyfriend who embodies this life style but keeps returning to him they are never shown as capable of thought. Whether the film means to say that or is simply limiting its view and depth of field to exclude their thoughts as peripheral to their lives this lack works to unconvince us. The characters are shown in attitudes of thought but never speak anything like a thought even a stupid one they are moved entirely by want and impulse. The hedonist boyfriend is shown as having friends how? Nobody not braindead exists in a state of pure mindlessness. That is the view of parents whose adolescent refuses to talk to them who can understand these kids? This film describes a lifeand this is an interesting accomplishment but a relatively narrow one. More difficult in this milieu and ultimately more interesting would have been to discover the person whose life it is or will have been.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a revealing interview included on the DVD Hou Hsiao Hsien says he wanted Millennium Mambo to be a picture of Taipei night life and also much more a multifaceted film with multiple points of view that he would have liked to make six hours long something postmodern and deconstructed and freeform and improvised but modernist too in some aspects.The actual film isn't so much multifaceted or plot less as it is a portrait in the moment of a few people composed with a voiceover from ten years later from the point of view of a pretty middleclass girl called Vicky The beestinglipped doeeyed Qi Shu who also stars in the presentday chapter of Hou's recent Three Times who's stuck in a dysfunctional relationship with a spoiled also pretty middleclass boy the bleachedhaired Hao Hao Chunhao Tuan who does drugs and hits on Vicky when she least wants to be hit on and who won't work and as Vicky's omnipresent voiceover tells us at one point has stolen his dad's Rolex and pawned it for a lot of money. They live together and hang out at clubs and Vicky works at a bar as a hostess a euphemism for a lap dancer who does drugs and drinks with customers and probably has sex with them  like Liang Ching Annie Shizuka Inoh the actressnarrator of Hou's 1995 Good Men Good Women. Vicky's bar job gets her involved with an older gangsterish man named Jack Jack Kao the actress Liang Ching's dead lover in Good Men.Millennium Mambo doesn't show us Taipei nightlife in any collective or panoramic sense. It shows us  a few times  the hazy corners of a few bright clubs with little crowds of attractive young people playing games and doing drugs and alcohol and it shows us  many times  corners of the apartment where Vicky and Hao Hao live and bits of a mountain town in Hokkaido Japan where Vicky goes invited initially by a couple of boys she meets.Atypically for Hou the camera moves around quite a bit too in this film following the people and hugging their faces and bodies  but also lingering in his old style statically observing doorways walls light fixtures or windows with a train going by outside. Many cigarettes are lit many are smoked. Meth is puffed in a pipe. Hao Hao pouts. Vicky looks sad or angry. The couple break up but Vicky comes back or Hao Hao comes after her. It's approachavoidance he tells her she's from another planet but he keeps getting her back. Jack is an oasis for Vicky but at a crucial time in winter when she goes to Japan he isn't available leaving her a key and a cell phone to wander the streets. She lies in bed. She stares out the window. In a long outtake on the DVD about her Japan sojourn Jack actually calls her and she's got a cold. In the final cut he never calls and she remains healthy. What's left isn't much though as always for Hou and for many Chinese directors the visuals are lush and beautifully lit even if the frames are empty and the plot line though never absent as his interview promises goes nowhere. Millennium Mambo's reference to the end of the millennium and perhaps changes in China and Hongkong? seems like the sixhour movie and the portrait of Taipei nightlife Hou promises in his interview to have come to us as little more than the pretty but empty fragments of a vague lost intention. This is a remake of Antonioni's L'Avventura in winter with young attractive Asians  and Qi Shu as the new Monica Vitti  but without the worldweariness or awareness of any sort of fading cultural heritage and with instead of Antonioni's haunting white noise a nagging techno score.".

	schema:headline " Are you willing to do the work?";
	schema:reviewBody "Apparently the major critics were not willing.  Hou Hsiaohsien is no longer the Flavor of the Month if the reception given to  Millennium Mambo  is any guide.  Hou may no longer be trendy but his latest film remains a masterpiece  just another notch on the Master's belt.  The critics castigated Hou for wasting our collective time with a movie about a party girl simultaneously they praised the juvenile  Kill Bill  to the skies.  The critic for the New York Times essentially declared that the artistry in the movie wasn't worth it.  The critic was  bored  by the artistry.Meanwhile those of us who are NOT bored by Hou's artistry may enjoy a feast of it in this edgy profoundly sad movie.  It's set in Taipei in 2001 though the narrating heroine  Vicky  a gorgeous Shu Qi  speaks to us from 10 years in the  future.  The film was actually MADE in 2001 though it didn't reach American shores until earlier this year  hence an unintended poignancy arises from the fact that we too are looking at the film's events from the future  a jaded rancorous postSeptember 11 future.  We feel as despairing as the narrating Vicky sounds and observe the decadent nightlife depicted here with the same sense of disbelief  were we really that hopeful were we really that careless when the new millennium was ushered in?  In the first scene she's walking  almost dancing really  down a long concrete promenade under pale florescent lights while the walltowall techno music starts thumping ever louder. It's a moment of incandescent happiness in a movie that has few such moments.For the unpleasant details soon assert themselves  she's getting spacey on drugs in a nightclub returning home to a livein boyfriend who is abusive on drugs himself and erratically but dangerously jealous.  One scene at once nasty and blackly humorous shows the boyfriend literally sniffing for evidence of adultery on Vicky.  The girl occasionally rebels at these indignities and leaves the jerk but as if hypnotized she always returns whenever he finds her and begs her to come back to him  and he ALWAYS finds her.  Hou instinctively understands the selfdestructive persona and he meticulously illustrates Vicky's addictions whether to cigarettes booze excitement or degrading sexual relationships.  The narration gives us a crucial clue as well  we learn that this boyfriend of hers convinced her to blow off her final high school exam years back which basically made her a dropout and started her on a path toward a wasted life.  Hou also understands WHY we're selfdestructive he understands that failure is so much easier.Occasionally we get a break from the woozyheaded nauseous neon underworld of Taipei and find ourselves in a snowcovered fantasyland on the Hokkaido island of Japan.  Here while frolicking in a winter wonderland with a casual Japanese boyfriend and his brother Vicky reverts with much relief to childhood.  There's a poignant moment when she leaves an imprint of her face in a mound of snow.  The camera lingers lovingly on the image of the barely visible imprint  it's as convenient a symbol as any for the barely visible life of a pretty party girl without talents or prospects the type of girl one usually sees only fleetingly in movies about more melodramatic subjects like gangsters  and yes this movie is about gangsters too. She's the hangeron the pretty ornament on the arm of the criminal.  Well leave it to Hou Hsiaohsien the world's greatest working director to dare to assert that the Vickys of the world not only have a story to tell but that their stories can be as bleak and nihilistic  and as artfully rendered  as any of your King Lears. It goes without saying that the Hou's camera placement is utterly and simply without peer.  If anything Millennium Mambo  marks an advance in his technique  he takes a little more control here and is not quite so blandly omniscient as he can sometimes be.  It's hard to write about technicalities but Hou somehow has managed to find the perfect balance between a focused POV and his more usual reliance on oblique reference points.  His cameraman Mark Lee PingBing  of  In the Mood for Love fame gloriously realizes Hou's vision with incredible color  smeary and throbbing neon in Taipei ethereal and misty white in Japan.  Finally Hou has also convinced me that techno and  Deep House  music can actually approximate art . . . as long as this type of music is paired with well a movie by Hou Hsiaohsien.  See his   Goodbye South Goodbye  for more evidence.Millennium Mambo  is a mustsee for the cineaste.  9 stars out of 10.".

I think one of the reasons why it is so sad is that the director juxtaposes scenes where Shu Qi is radiantly happy to those where she's stuck in her miserable life and I think this contrast amplifies the depressing circumstances we see. As others have mentioned this film doesn't have much of a plot and I personally find these kinds of films difficult to appreciate. But for some reason I find myself strangely compelled by this film. I agree with an earlier poster that the opening scene of Shu Qi running in slow motion with the techno music throbbing in the background from a PHENOMENAL soundtrack as others have also noted is extremely powerful and compelling. Early in the movie I also liked the scene where Shu Qi is being checked out by her whacked out boyfriend and she barely tolerates it in classic passiveaggressive style. I think the long takes with little action work because Shu Qi is so compelling re gorgeous that she can just sit there smoking a cigarette and the audience or at least me is totally captivated.".

	schema:reviewBody "The mood in which I left after viewing Millennium Mambo was a heavy sort of depression.  I felt as if I had experienced or reexperienced through memory events causing one to give in to hopelessness to accept being dominated by another.  In retrospect Vicky describes this period of time as being hypnotized or under a spell.  Hou Hsiaohsien is successful in casting that spell on his audience.  Three aspects of the film lend to this success the nonsequential unfolding of events the use of longtakes from a more or less distant perspective and the sound track. One of the first glimpses into Vickys life with Ah Hao is at a time in their relationship when she has already given up.  From here we are taken further back to various points in their relationship.  There is no story per se she is simply caught in this cycle of him finding her and her leaving yet we do learn how she ended up in this cycle.  There was a time when she resisted his advances when she scolded his dangerous drug use a time before she felt trapped.  Knowing the end result of their relationship maintains a sense of hopelessness throughout the film.  It is this constant sense of hopelessness with no comic relief or side story to lift the weight of the mood that causes the audience to experience the spell she is remembering. Cold and colder that was what I demanded of my camera   When I read this quote I immediately recalled the scene I mentioned above when Vicky endures Ah Haos advances sexual or otherwise annoyed but in complete submission and as a matter of routine.  The camera follows him to the floor straining to see through the table obstructing the view but not getting any closer.  While this may have been a mixture of pathos and eros as Ah Hao smelled her body for the scent of other men it was indeed a disturbing violation that the camera forced the audience to participate in by calmly looking on.  Other longtakes showing two or more simultaneous independent actions helped to invoke her sense of loneliness and the monotony of her life as the minutes dragged. Thirdly the soundtrack with its hypnotic beat and mix of highpitched eerie sounds matched the repetition of events played out on the screen. He was the DJ controlling the sounds added over the same neverending rhythm. This is what she lived with day in and day out.  Even as she is walking alone over the bridge the same music is playing in her head.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sick and tired of reading complaints from people that this film as well as most of Hou Hsiaohsien's others are too boring impersonal detached plotless etc. Generally speaking people don't just casually walk into one of Hou's films chances are if you go and see one you already know basically what to expect  which is more or less the polar opposite of Hollywoodstyle filmmaking. That said Hou's films are among the most artful innovative breathtaking and purely cinematic in the absolute best sense of the word made today and Millennium Mambo is certainly no exception. In fact I would even rank it as one of Hou's five best films along with Flowers of Shanghai Goodbye South Goodbye The Puppetmaster and A Time to Live and a Time to Die.The film is exquisitely photographed by Mark Li Pingbin whose camera here is even more hypnotically mobile than usual and  perhaps to an even greater extent than in any of Hou's previous features  takes on an ambiguously voyeuristic role. There are scenes in Millennium Mambo that are among the most haunting and beautiful in not only Hou's cinema but in all modern world cinema. The opening voiceover sequence that calls to mind the best voiceover work from the films of Wong Karwai and Terrence Malick the scene where Vicky lies in bed with the window reflection of the untuned television sumperimposing the passing trains behind her and the scene set amidst the snowdrifts are probably the finest examples but there are countless others as well. Shu Qi is positively luminous in the film's central role. Her performance is at times even reminiscent of those by Anna Karina Liv Ullman and Monica Vitti for Godard Bergman and Antonioni respectively. The supporting performers especially Jack Kao are also superb.As you can probably guess I love Hou Hsiaohsien and Millennium Mambo. I will be the first to concede however that his films are decidedly not for all tastes. They are usually very deliberatelypaced sometimes require knowledge of Asian almost always Taiwanese history  which means  god forbid  research for most viewers and never feel in the slightest like Hollywood product. Now you've been warned. If this doesn't sound appealing or entertaining to you then go watch Pearl Harbor. But if it does I highly recommend that you check out Millennium Mambo as well as Hou's other films  all of which are genuinely worthwhile.My rating 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I really loved this movie. Many people didn't and I really understand why  it's a very slow movie. Everything takes time everything is long and you don't really see where the director really wants to go. He follows this girl. She appears to us at the beginning at the film walking in a very long corridor in a slow motion and on pop music. As this girl is impersonated by Shu Qi she is absolutely beautiful. This girl smokes she seems a little bit sad and you don't really know what is her story. The voice of a girl tells you about the relationships this girl had in the past and this voice says that when she speaks it's in 2010 ten years later after when the action takes place. You never really understand why this voice says that. You never really understand what this girl wants and what is her past although you have some informations during the film you just see her live and it's absolutely fascinating and hypnotic. It's hard to say but you see how much Hou Hsia Hsien is fascinated by beauty time and modern life. His fascination for time is also present in Three Times. In this movie everything is normal nothing is spectacular and incredible about the plot the sets or whatever but everything is poetic mysterious and hypnotic. It's the kind of feeling you have when you see someone and you don't know why but this person fascinates you. It's the same kind of feeling. It's fascinating as when you see someone's life and just let this person free to do what she wants you just look at this person. It's a very good movie although fascination is something very personal.".

This is what the visuals of the film tell more than the dialog or plot Each scene is filmed in a single shot. Hou or rather Mark Li used available light most of the time which actually produces meaning here The scenes in bars and clubs are shot using very lightsensitive so images are very grainy dark but warm and very colorintensive  one seems to be inside a protective womb which becomes gradually oppressive. The forces that keep the girl inside are represented by her neurotic boy friend who watches her constantly and keeps her from making exams.After she becomes a stripper she meets Jack a gangster but very decent guy who gradually leads her out of this world  in one scene he actually drives her out of a dark tunnel into bright daylight in his car. The outside scenes given less sensitive film stock are much clearer but it's winter most of the time  contrary to the bar scenes it's cold gray and white but clear.

The suspense became so great so i gave up and watched letterman instead!!!!!!Give this movie a go if you dare if you watch from start to end with out looking away from the screen you must be retarted.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's half satisfying and half disappointing that Hou HsiaoHsien's Millennium Mambo is so bad. Since I was first introduced to his work nine or so months ago I have been convinced that his style represents an interesting wrong turn in the evolution of cinema once in a while producing empassioned but confusing and dull films like Dust in the Wind and City of Sadness and once producing a film very nearly a masterpiece Flowers of Shanghai but usually producing flat unemotional and forgettable films like A Time to Live a Time to Die The Puppetmaster and Goodbye South Goodbye. Hou simply refuses to give the audience characters to whom they can react to emotionally instead building these fascinating ultralong takes where we watch the characters go about their usual business all of which only serve unfortunately to bore me.In Millennium Mambo we track a year in the life of an independent teenage girl Vicky in the year 2001. The film is narrated from ten years in the future a very curious decision. It could have worked well but it feels like just a gimmick here. Hou desperately wants the situations to feel nostalghic but that's not really possible in any way in this particular film.The major problem in Millennium Mambo is that the characters and the situation are entirely cliche and well dull at that. Vicky is a club kid who is being pulled between two guys the uberjealous thug Haohao and the kind but vaguely threatening Jack a Japanese gangster. Vicky goes in between the two of them Haohao keeps coming back to get her and whenever Vicky runs away from him she ends up going back to Jack. None of the characters are well developed and even if they were you really couldn't care much about them. In between there are a dozen stock Hou scenes like eating and other such things a lot of long and dull scenes of drug use etc. There is one major alteration in the style the camera moves around almost violently all the time in nearly every scene if not every scene. In his early films Hou barely ever moved the camera. In Goodbye South Goodbye Hou started to move his camera a bit. I dismissed it as a fancy that would pass since it was nothing major see my review for it. I was wrong and in Flowers of Shanghai the camera would rock beautifully back and forth across the scenes. The pattern didn't change much in that film but it all worked so marvelously just adding to the mood and not boring. Now in Millennium Mambo almost everything is filmed in closeup and the camera follows these close ups in sharp jerks. It doesn't do anything unfortunately. Other than being an extremely noticeable alteration of style Hou hasn't changed his content editing or narrative patterns at all from Goodbye South Goodbye again I pine for the stylistic leaps in Flowers of Shanghai. The characters and themes are similar to previous films the editing is interesting but has longsince become cliche for Hou and the scenes all develop exactly the same as they always have.Millennium Mambo is actually more dull than any other Hou film making it his worst that I've seen. I'd say avoid it at all costs except for the fact that I want intelligent people on my side of this argument. Hou has received far too much critical praise and I am convinced that if a majority of cineastes would see his work they'd agree with me. I say then see it just to see how bad this guy is. I say praise Tsai Mingliang dismiss Hou Hsiaohsien. Tsai is the future of modern cinema at least one important corner of it. If that opinion exists more consistently Taiwanese cinema will improve and become more prominent. 510.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.This is one of the most ambitious film projects I have seen risky and successful. It is not successful Proust in my opinion something different but similar.Proust used the magic of words to weave a life out of remembered fragments. That magic depends on the ability of the written word to generate images in our minds  Proust found the ability to create these in such a way that they converge with recalled images of ours though the focus is purportedly his. This is a particular kind of selfgenerating selfreferential art. No life should be without it. No literary life can.Film differs from literature of course but most profoundly in this context. Film is already an image. Film images can converge with ones in our memories but they are more anchored. And since they are generated for us we have to follow rather than lead. Ruiz comes to this from a fabulist perspective meaning he can make cinematic images less specific more vague. The solution works we are presented with a blizzard of characters scant narrative footing and lots of folding time folding image folding observer overlap. This way the images we are given are softer and more pliable than usual and allow for something like the consciousnessskipping of Proust. But it is not the same we watch someone creating a remembered life but don't really participate in the intimate and shared way of the books.And instead of a book about a life we have a film about a book about a life. That difference is significant in some ways when we have Gilberte we just can't help but fall in love with her a little ourselves. When the concert is fully underway we see Marcel seeing something. The room shifts and we know some manifold epiphany is underway but don't see' it ourselves. We participate in a cinematic experience not a life. That life partially unfolds for us in images later but we don't relive it.All of this is cast in a visual meditation. In the Mood for Love' works some of this territory as does The Thin Red Line.' This differs in the inherent voyeurism and the magical reality created by one of the onscreen characters and the striking music generated by another.Opening shots are promises. The titles are accompanied by a familiar vision of water over rocks. But it shifts downstream and cants before we know it and then moves back upstream telling us the whole idea right there. Then we have a remarkable bedroom scene that by itself is one of the strongest moments in film  the dictation comes close to the genuine Proust effect and the surreal movement of furniture against the camera are truly hypnotizing.There's one device that is used subtly one that you would expect is pretentiously inflated. But it isn't. This is the camera' that Ruiz gives Marcel as a boy a lantern that freezes himself frozen twice certain ads certain photos... several other images. Completely understated and thus more powerful.Ted's Evaluation  4 of 4 Every visually literate person should experience this.".

It is not successful Proust in my opinion something different but similar.Proust used the magic of words to weave a life out of remembered fragments. That magic depends on the ability of the written word to generate images in our minds  Proust found the ability to create these in such a way that they converge with recalled images of ours though the focus is purportedly his. This is a particular kind of selfgenerating selfreferential art. No life should be without it. No literary life can.Film differs from literature of course but most profoundly in this context. Film is already an image. Film images can converge with ones in our memories but they are more anchored. And since they are generated for us we have to follow rather than lead. Ruiz comes to this from a fabulist perspective meaning he can make cinematic images less specific more vague. The solution works we are presented with a blizzard of characters scant narrative footing and lots of folding time folding image folding observer overlap. This way the images we are given are softer and more pliable than usual and allow for something like the consciousnessskipping of Proust. But it is not the same we watch someone creating a remembered life but don't really participate in the intimate and shared way of the books.And instead of a book about a life we have a film about a book about a life. That difference is significant in some ways when we have Gilberte we just can't help but fall in love with her a little ourselves. When the concert is fully underway we see Marcel seeing something. The room shifts and we know some manifold epiphany is underway but don't see' it ourselves. We participate in a cinematic experience not a life. That life partially unfolds for us in images later but we don't relive it.All of this is cast in a visual meditation. In the Mood for Love' works some of this territory as does The Thin Red Line.' This differs in the inherent voyeurism and the magical reality created by one of the onscreen characters and the striking music generated by another.Opening shots are promises. The titles are accompanied by a familiar vision of water over rocks. But it shifts downstream and cants before we know it and then moves back upstream telling us the whole idea right there. Then we have a remarkable bedroom scene that by itself is one of the strongest moments in film  the dictation comes close to the genuine Proust effect and the surreal movement of furniture against the camera are truly hypnotizing.There's one device that is used subtly one that you would expect is pretentiously inflated. But it isn't. This is the camera' that Ruiz gives Marcel as a boy a lantern that freezes himself frozen twice certain ads certain photos... several other images. Completely understated and thus more powerful.Ted's Evaluation  4 of 4 Every visually literate person should experience this.";

It's everything that arthouse cinema is accused of  elitist overintellectual precious elliptical methodically paced privileging miseenscene over virtues like plot or motivated characterisation.  It is also a model of literary adaptation that will hopefully once and for all put certain practitioners out of business the most visually astonishing  not in the sense of merely beautiful but achieving effects you didn't think possible funny and emotional film in years and the first new film I've wanted to squeeze to my heart since CHUNGKING EXPRESS.In one way at least it's even an improvement on Proust's sublime novel which frequently breaks off to offer remarkable guides on how to write and to live life.  These are indispensable to anyone who wants to exist to the full as a human being but uncorrected when Proust died they are often wearingly repetitive and confused.Ruiz finds economical jawdropping incisive ways to show what Proust wanted to say.  Because this isn't anything so common as a film of the book  it is an interpretation a deconstruction a reimagining.  Proust like Nabokov sets traps for the unwary reader and because the narrator seems so convincingly Proustian in the detail it's easy to confuse him with Proust in the spirit.  But M. is a deeply flawed unreliable narrator who does not always see what's in front of him who riven by jealousy prejudice snobbery malady and selflaceration is not always the most objective observer.Ruiz emphasises this by foregrounding the seeming differences between himself and Proust as artists Proust advocates an active conscious reclamation of ourselves and our pasts Ruiz a Surrealist explores the Unconscious.  Proust was the most notorious rewriter in the history of literature every sentence subjected to the most rigourous scrutiny yet he died without fully revising Le Temps Retrouve.  This leaves the text filled with gaps omissions contradictions 'mistakes' slips an ultimate loss of control  the perfect ground for a Surrealist excavation.Ruiz reveals M.'s essential powerlessness his yielding to the power of the Unconscious M. thinks he makes a decision to discover the past Ruiz shows from the very beginning of the film how he has no choice.What Surrealism does best is to show the terrifying instability of the seemingly stable everyday domestic fixed.  This fits in with Proust's project because his stepping outside of Time shows how amorphous Time is. A centuriesold society with huge mansions and manors inhabited by fixed personnages with fixed names and personalities in a significant period the Belle Epoque giving onto World War One is actually shown to be deeply unstable perceived as it is though the mind of M. who is constantly changing  his social status his body through sickness his selfperception and view of the world and of literature etc.The opening sequence is masterly illustrative.  The real Proust lies in the neardark in bed wheezingly ill reciting his work to his faithful servant Celeste.  Here is an image of wholeness fact legend  a great writer writes his great book.  But the scene is riven with instability Proust lies immobile in his bed while his objects and ornaments move freely around the room.This is a motif that reverberates throughout the film the elegant freedom of the dominating crowding bibelots and the rigid sterile geometrical movements of the people who are supposed to own them.  But it also shows a heartening split between mind and body while the latter lies inert and dying the former remains vibrant and transformative.Where to begin with Ruiz's aweinspiring masterwork?  The sublime play with mirrors and cameras revealing great truths about perception deception mediation objectivity subjectivity revelation and concealment?  The play of different selves throughout the film where the monstrously aged through memory can return to their former beautiful selves culminating in an astonishing climactic sequence where M. in his three guises protagonistnarrator of the film even this is split narrated in voiceover by a different person the author of the bookfilm and himself as a young man that allows the other two to exist as he wanders Alicelike a haunting Surrealist presence thoughout the film through the classical ruins of time linked to the impossibility of one fixed work of art?The complex analysis of roleplay on the one hand liberating one from a fixed self on the other repressing one in terms of social positoin reputation etc.?  The role of of reenactment in the recovery of the past and its transmutation through subjective perception? The subtle changes and omissions that Ruiz deliberately employs to interrogate the emphasis of Proust's work?  The connection between voyeurism existing in a society like being imprisoned in a panopoticon and the necessary observation of the artist to reveal truth?Ruiz's canny casting emphasising allusive qualities e.g. mother and daughter Deneuve and a hero played by a man with a similar name to their loverhusband? Alain RobbeGrillet doyen of formal games in country houses? Edith Scob Franju muse of broken fragile beauty playing dessicated Oriane? the link between the narrator director Patrice Chereau and two of the film's stars who have also appeared in one of his films?The profusion of different artforms which combine to create a moment of such great emotion that I with M. cried?  The teasing play between the protagonist his creator and this film's creator?  The amusing variations on the theme of prostitution?  The film's action actually only consists of three elaborate episodes but the plot floods with the past and the future the real and imagined the fictional and historical or more correctly metafictional theory and practice.It should not be forgotten that there are other simpler pleasures beloved of historicalfilm fans  the countryhouses with their astonishing avenues the town mansions with their vast halls the choreography of the party scenes the sublime costumes the elaborate recreation of a time and place.

	schema:reviewBody "Le Temps Retrouve or Time Regained 1999 Starring Marcello Mazarella Vincent Perez Catherine Deneuve Emmanuelle Beart John Malkovitch Pascal Gregory MarieFrance Pisier Chiara Mastriani Arielle Dombasle Edith Scob Elsa Zyberstein Christian Vadim Dominique Labourier Phillip Genoud Melvil Poupad Mathilde Seigner Jacques Pieler Hele Surgere Andre Engel Georges Du Fresne Lucien Pascal Jerome Prieur Bernard Paitrat Jean Claude Jay Director Raoul Ruiz In this book is written your life and the life of all men said the Angel of Death  to review it would take an eternity...........Based on Marcel Proust's Au Recherche Du Temps Perdu  or Remembrance Of Things Past largely considered not only a classic of French literature but possibly the world's longest literary work this is director Raoul Ruiz' stunning film adaptation released in 1999. This film received numerous awards and the Cannes Film Festival ate it up much like one long French banquet complete with French wine. True to the novels Swann's Way Guermantez Swann In Love we follow the life of Marcel Proust beginning with the end that is his death. Wracked with consumption he is on his deathbed and his mind drifts from memory to memory reliving his life and encountering all the people in it. Veteran French actress Catherine Deneuve stars as the brazen courtesan Odette. While perhaps Deneuve is too old for the part of a lively woman of leisure and lady of the night she manages to capture the spirit of the character without a single flaw being the terrific actress she is. John Malkovich turns his back on America momentarily to become French in the role of the Baron Du Charlus who talks a big deal but is essentially a licentious and unsympathetic character. Vincent Perez is Morel who engages in one affair after another unlike Proust who appears to love only Odette and Gilberte the beautiful and talented Emmanuelle Beart his childhood sweetheart. Child actor Georges Du Fresne gets a lot of screen time as Marcel when he was a young boy. The most attractive aspects of the film as everyone generally concurs is the cinematography and art direction which while admittedly dreamy and glamorous is quite frankly Proustian. The camera moves freely floating ghostlike between characters giving us access to their conversations and private moments. There's a mix of intense natural sunlight and evening blue colors in the nightlife scenes. I can't describe how magical the movie's look truly is. The costumes are authentic to the Edwardian Era and World War I period 19001918. Though this film doesn't cover the historic aspects in too much detail the various aristocratic characters i.e. the Guermantes princes dukes and princesses speak of World War I the German enemy and the aftermath of the Great War including the Spanish Flu Epidemic the film manages to believably encompass a time and place though perhaps the film 1900 does a better job of this. Fans of Marcel Proust will delighted even if some portions are omitted but truthfully a film adaptation of the Proust Time cycle would take over 6 hours. Some people seem to miss some of the more shocking portions of the film. Proust was a bisexual writer who attempted to document the Belle Epoque as he lived it. In this film we are presented with gay and lesbian characters  Albert and Albertine. There are two scenes which subtle as they were were quite powerful such as the scene in which Proust peeks in to Albert's bedroom door and discovers he has a sadomasichisticerotic relationship with a male lover. Also even while Proust is dying he pays Odette money to perform oral sex on him. These little things are overlooked in the course of a long and beautiful film with actors who truly live their role and give them nuance and color. One character in particular Morel's American girlfriend interjects the English words It's absolutely disgusting! during gossip of the Duchess and the Duke. This film is an enjoyable historic film with a late 90's European film gloss and a feeling of respect and reverence for Marcel Proust. Wonderful and haunting full of poignant moments and mesmerizing at times magic realist moments. This film is sure to delight all Francophiles everywhere. Enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're looking for a movie that faithfully reduces In Search of Lost Time to 2 hours or so this isn't it. But then that's impossible so you will be frustrated in your search.What this is is a problematic movie.If you don't know Proust's 4000 page novel In Search of Lost Time I suspect a lot of this movie won't make sense to you. If you do know it on the other hand you might be upset that X does not look like Proust's character A that Y scene was left out etc.So the best way to enjoy this movie  and there is a lot in it to enjoy  is to know Proust's novel well enough so that you can make sense of the movie but then to forget about it and treat this as a movie that is not trying to film Proust's novel.I could go on about the way the film jumps from scene to scene based on recollections of the narrator. One might say that that's Proustian but Proust does not in fact jump from one short scene to the next. So I'll leave that aside.What this is for me  and I have seen the movie several times  is a remarkable collection of performances by some of France's greatest actors and actresses  and John Malkovich. The performances by Catherine Deneuve as Odette no she does not look at all like I had imagined Odette from the novel but she is radiant in this movie Emmanuelle Bart as Gilberte Swann ditto John Malkovich Charlus ditto in spades he does not look at all like Proust describes Charlus but he creates a remarkably moving and coherent character Vincent Perez Morel he may look like Proust's Morel but he gives him more depth and MarieFrance Pisier Mme Verdurin are all absolutely first rate beautiful to watch. They make the film for me. Other characters important in Proust are either reduced to very small roles the Duke and Duchess de Guermantes the Prince and Princess de G or vanish altogether Swann Marcel's father. But watching the above great actors and actresses give great performances is for me the great value of this movie.If you want Proust you'll just have to read it.But if you want to see some of France's greatest actors and actresses at their best you could do a lot worse than this movie.".

I was worried I might hate this film not knowing anything about Proust other than he wrote a multivolumed masterwork about time and memory. Then I saw it...wow! I cannot praise Mr Ruiz enough for what he has achieved. The camera work sets and lighting are stunning. As Marcel's memory takes him back and forth through his life the sets and furniture often move around whilst the scene is played out  all emphasising the fragility and hallucinatory qualities of his memory. And there is the music...wow again. It is never intrusive but always creates the perfect background to what is happening on screen. It is not overly sentimental and never tries to force you into feeling emotion unlike someone like John WilliamsS. Spielberg who tries to ram it down your throat. As for plot many characters and relationships are never fully explained or revealed. Many reviewers seem offended that a film expects them to display attention and interest but I feel that they're missing the point. Plot is often not the point of the film instead it is a film about time and memory hence the title!. Plot is not allowed to dominate the narrative structure it is the emotions and memory of Marcel. The most offensive thing that some other reviewers seem to find about this film is that it is novel and original  what a crime!! I had never read Proust before I saw this film but I have a long enough attention span and an open enough mind to appreciate the sheer beauty of its images and the wonderful originality of its style. I urge anyone remotely appreciative of excellent filmmaking to see this film. It might even as it has with me motivate you to read the book. I am now three and a third volumes in and it is the greatest and most beautifully written novel I have ever read in my life. Thank you Mr Ruiz and thank you Marcel! SEE THIS FILM NOW!!!".

Plot is often not the point of the film instead it is a film about time and memory hence the title!. Plot is not allowed to dominate the narrative structure it is the emotions and memory of Marcel. The most offensive thing that some other reviewers seem to find about this film is that it is novel and original  what a crime!! I had never read Proust before I saw this film but I have a long enough attention span and an open enough mind to appreciate the sheer beauty of its images and the wonderful originality of its style. I urge anyone remotely appreciative of excellent filmmaking to see this film. It might even as it has with me motivate you to read the book. I am now three and a third volumes in and it is the greatest and most beautifully written novel I have ever read in my life. Thank you Mr Ruiz and thank you Marcel! SEE THIS FILM NOW!!!";

It aims for the spirit of the books and a taste of what their atmosphere is like and knows that to even approach this humble end it must at the very least begin by pushing the means of the cinema to their limit. It is not stupid enough to think it can equal the intellectual effect of Proustian prose. That would be absurd and impossible. So how does Ruiz's film fare? Suffice it to say that it does not take long to realize that this not a pretentious film but a deeply thought out planned and fully realized one. If it manages to capture the spirit of Proustian investigation it did not do this easily and don't expect to digest it in one or two viewings. You will certainly be immediately impressed though I'll tell you that much. Be prepared to ACTIVELY participate rather than be DONE TO. There are constant shifts of time period between the different stages of Proust's life and the fully mobile camera never stands still for your convenience.The acting is top notch and multifaceted all the way and the production design is magnificent. Although it certainly looks very expensive I can't imagine anyone doing a better job with less except maybe Truffaut Jules and Jim or Renoir French CanCan. There are plenty of distractions along the way especially the buttgorgeous Emmanuel Beart for us helpless men of hetero persuasion not to mention the jawdropping classical beauty of Chiara Mastroianni in her one scene which she steals.  On second viewing after having just watched the Coen brothers' ultrasubtle and hilariously clever 'Blood Simple' I did vaguely detect some weaknesses that someone like Eric Rohmer or Rossellini and Scorsese in their prime would have been careful to authenticate to 3 dimensions but they weren't noticeable enough to put your finger on right away.I have never seen another Ruiz film before but I think that the greatest thing he did here was to let Proust's general sense of things his ultracultured neurotic sensibility become his codirector on the film. I'm sure at the very least he made all his actors read the book he was adapting and discussed it with them thoroughly. Just the experience of doing that will  enrich the aspirations and imagination of any actor because Proust's writing is all about going into long analyses of things that may seem trivial at first glance. All I can say is Ruiz really blew me away on this film and I can't wait to see what else he had up his sleeve all these years that I've been missing his movies.".

Characters and events move back  forth in time and if that's not confusing enough sometimes they appear in the past and present at the same time. She later admitted she lost interest at times and fought off dozing due to the slow pageantlike pacing. This is a demanding film that requires your absolute attention preferably when you're not tired.I firmly believe the French make the best costume films and this film is a perfect example. Although the handsome period sets and costumes are finely detailed they are marred by the too dark photography during the indoor scenes. To make matters worse the white subtitles are hard to read at times because the letters lack black borders making them impossible to read against white or light backgrounds.The actors seemed good matches for their characters but listening to John Malkovich speak drawling phonetic French is bizarre if not funny.Film adapted from novels should stand on their own without the viewer having to read the novel beforehand in order to follow it. 'Time Regained' is probably the best example of not being able to follow a film based on a novel or to make it worse several novels.For Proust fans ONLY and those fluent in French due to the bad subtitling.".

More prestigious films starting in the mid90's starring actors of standing Mastroyanni Huppert here Deneuve and Malkovich and with some clout of respectability. Watching these makes me cherish so much more the spontaneous upheaval of Three Crowns or City of Pirates.So this is the landmark film of that second phase a bulky sprawling film about French writer Marcel Proust and his work. About sprawling deathbed recollections of a life lived arranged into a story about stories in an attempt to reveal something of their machinations and ours in weaving them in the mind before or after the event.It is a noble effort with multiple points of interest.Oh the sets are sumptuous roomfuls of an impeccably dressed society at the doorstep of disasterWWI is booming away in close proximitywho mingle in coquetry at the clinking sounds of fine glassware.

And then a camerathe internal narrator of memorythat introduces the distorted distance of time this is quite marvelous as actually reordering realityfurniture move around on whims our narrator. Fine stuff so far.But this really falls with Proust's ideas on the role of fiction the thinking man so hopelessly removed from the actual tangible things of life that he can only find solace in turning them to their spiritual equivalents. Who instead of loving can only write about love who wastes the manifold possibilities of 'now!' in tinkering with dead time.Earlier filmmakers astutely exposed this destructive facet for what it is a chimera of the mind that traps the soul in old films of memory. Resnais in his fascinating overall project about memory Antonioni in Blowup earlier yet it was film noir. Beckett has captured the dissication better than anyone pungent stuff his. Ruiz by contrast romances the idea as though it was a pleasant stroll. He romances it so earnestly that it drains his entire film.It is all so finelike the glasswareso refined and pliable with some grace of apparent form.

Imagine everyone having to read one of the most lurid and overrated books of the 20th century to see a film which should substantiate itself.  What an exaggerated claim.  There's no place for intellectual hubris or their own ingroup manifesto here.I had high hopes for this film actually but after the first hour I saw that it was devoid and lacking any duality which would allow us to reflect on what is occurring. It is played by rigid high handed oafs who are spoiled to begin with.Most of the first hour is infested by artless vignettes which are probably the deluded Proust's memory and they are reworked in such a disordered way that what comes out is merely a bunch of meaningless trite and vacuous scenes with banal jargon not only because they hold absolutely no interest for us but because they do not invite a further contemplation of what 'time' was to Proust imagine listening to a bunch of snobs talk about the weather well that is what this basically is how philosophical can one get from that point of reference?  It begins to wear thin after the first scene and you pray that there will be no more discussions by those prosaic characters.  And it doesn't help that Proust himself is an insipid dandy who parades around in his best suits with his neatly trimmed moustache and becomes a voyeur if you are asleep already I don't blame you.Many of the scenes deal with characters which are entirely void of any human warmth or expression they are petty aristocrats snobs who sit and drink tea and eat stuffy food while looking down at the poor.  They are perverts who visit homosexual brothels and think themselves noble because they hold high office positions during the war while the common man spills his guts out at the front lines.  This is a complete waste of time!Malkovich is even an absurd caricature in here and his little dubbed French voice is entirely insipid.  I laughed at most of this.  We learn that he is a libertine who likes to visit male brothels and be whipped by sincere proletarian scum wow what a revelation on the mystery of human existence.  From the looks of the period pieces and the arrangements it was expensive but that doesn't carry a film with people walking around with no reference to the viewer.  Film is supposed to move us in a way either disgust us or interest us in some form of merit which it presents itself to us in human understanding but boredom to me is no artistic achievement.  Don't even bother with this pretentious and ennui filled work.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this film solely for the presence of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. But there are four characters who dominate and make this effort a characterbased film.Betty Compson was effervescent and convincing as a performer who is at ease on stage at a carnival poised and beautiful and able to connect with the audience. Her vivaciousness reminded me of Clara Bow. But her character turned out to be more nuanced than the typical vamp with a heart of gold. She was a little edgier maybe craftier. It was a little dispiriting to see her want to return to a man who treated her in a less than gentlemanly fashion to say the least. But I guess such undertones of sexism in a relationship and a woman being unable to resist an abusive boyfriend were accepted in films of this era.Milton Sills was convincing as a man born to be a barker at a carnival someone who will convince people they want to spend money for nothing. I thought maybe Fairbanks had this title role but he actually plays the unexpectedly kind son of the rather brutish Sills. The Sills character is somewhat redeeming in that he does at least look out for his son and wants nothing to jeopardize his son's professional future.Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s role was much more substantial than I expected. I thought maybe I had read in his autobiography that he was placed in this film primarily because he had had some possibly successful exposure in some other picture as a teenager. So I expected him to have a rather throwaway idiotic part but he is actually one of the leads and he acquitted himself well. His character was young but not immature earnest sensitive and intelligent but not cloying or unbelievable. He must have been only around eighteen when he made this one. He comes off as extremely likable for those DFJ fans who would like to see him in a role in which he was rewarded with decent screen time and a welldeveloped niceguy character.I found it sort of amusing that he wants to be a lawyer because his father is a 'barker' at what sometimes looks like a rather sorry carnival. I should not judge I was just not expecting that level of ambition in the barker's family. It was also a surprise to find out with whom DFJ winds up having a relationship. A lot of the drama takes place on a train like one of those you see the female band travel on in Some Like it Hot and that is where this relationship begins.Lastly I agree with the other reviewer that Dorothy Mackaill and for me DFJ made this film worthwhile. Her character was wise for her years probably had to work to stay alive and at the film's beginning seems like she is only in the cast to be Compson's independent indestructible sidekick. But her character Lou is something other than endlessly unflinching. She is vulnerable she is capable of being moved by the right fellow traveler who just happened to come along. So we find out that beyond her blonde extremely bobbed haircut and knowledge about the real world she has a soul and she is even feminine.As a characterdriven movie I would like to see this again for the two warmhearted souls of DFJ and Mackaill.".

In fact The last few feet of the film were lost and a still shot has been put in its place while the sound continues.

	schema:headline " Much more than expected";
	schema:reviewBody "The London Film festival screening was preceded by an entertaining but deprecatory account by Robert Gitt on the history of early sound technology and of this film in particular after references to actors speaking ultraslowly in order to minimise reverberation to dialogue dovetailed onto the start and end of alreadycompleted silent features to a finale lost to nitrate decay splices that split frames and an irreplaceable sound disc cracked into pieces by careless stacking I'd come to expect little more of the parttalkie The Barker than the status of technical curiosity. My previous experience with the genre had been limited to 1929's The Informer an excellent silent picture almost crippled by the switch into sound for its last few reels.The Barker however is nothing of the sort. It was very much better than I had been given any reason to suppose the dialogue stands comparison with anything from the talking era and the silent section is as fluent as the best of the pictures that had preceded it. Here is one film at least that managed to take the best of both worlds and produce a relatively harmonious combination.Inevitably the joins between the two styles come across with something of a jolt and the transition seems somewhat arbitrary the switch away from dialogue often appears to be triggered by violent action or strong emotion at which stage what is done or what is meant becomes more important than the minutiae of what is actually said. The truth of course is that the entire film was completed as a silent and only certain scenes pulled back for emergency rerecording before release. It was the good fortune of the producers that dialogue for these sections already existed in the form of the original play but it is a mark of the progression of sound technology in the brief interlude that the fullyassembled soundtrack could include an orchestral backing to the talkie sections which greatly eases the transitions between pure musical accompaniment and vocal scenes. There is certainly no evidence on the restored print of the physical damage to the soundtrack and the missing spliced frames are only occasionally evident as a slight jump in the picture. The only element I found obtrusive was a very obvious fake steamengine sound effect! The acting is generally excellent although I was taken aback to learn that modern consensus is that cool blonde Lou Dorothy Mackaill is far more 'natural' and attractive than dark vivacious Carrie having been told only that one was considered to have received an Oscar nomination betterdeserved by the other I naturally assumed that it was the lady with the fashionable helmet bob who had received the accolades of her contemporaries for looks and acting! I'm no Louise Brooks fan I'm afraid and the character struck me as slightly wooden with no sense of deeper passions beneath the smooth carapace I had to take the sincerity of her feelings on trust. She isn't the one who stands out from the rest of the cast for me.As the lead couple Milton Sills and Betty Compson are perfectly matched. Both are supremely in command of the silent screen conveying a world of emotional shading in a fleeting movement or a halted instant's regret yet both are entirely at home with the demands of the microphone as well Betty Compson's expressive little face needs no subtitles whether she is swigging bootleg spirits railing at or cajoling Lou scheming vengefully against Nifty or quarrelling violently with him and Sills dominates the picture in the title role. I'd never encountered him before but it was easy to see why he was a famous star of the era. His silent scenes with Carrie or his son Chris on the train are masterpieces of subtlety and body language while his talkie role  especially the nonstop breakneck barker's spiel that opens the first scene of the film  shows a man thoroughly in control of the spoken art. He manages to convey enough charisma to ensure that Nifty on the face of it a blustering domineering vulgarian retains the audience's sympathy and interest while Miss Compson likewise portrays jealous insecure Carrie as a fullyfledged character. Surprisingly  and refreshingly  the plot does not as I had anticipated with a groan feature her falling in love with the handsome young intruder whose arrival she so bitterly resents... Douglas Fairbanks Jr puts in an amazingly youthful and gangly appearance as the juvenile lead the acting comes across as a little gauche in comparison with the more experienced stars and the grin is perhaps a little selfconscious here  he had yet to grow into it  but the character himself is naive and inexperienced and the performance certainly shows ability. As a talkie debut it must have augured well for his future career.The opening of The Barker is very good indeed it starts out at an easy 810 the maximum I'd give to any film unless of exceptional impact but I did end up feeling that the quality falls off slightly towards the end into the realms of the strained and melodramatic. Even Milton Sills can't always bring off hammy dialogue with conviction in the outragedfather scenes and the whole payoff feels somewhat rushed in comparison to the gradual development of the buildup suddenly Chris is married suddenly he leaves suddenly he's back with the former 'hardboiled Hannah' transformed into an adoring and submissive housewife Show him dear. I wanted a happy ending but when Nifty collapses and then tries to go out and do his act dead drunk it seems too much of a copout to have everything come out of it smelling of roses after all.The film is good it's well worth seeing for its own sake given its technical difficulties it's excellent. I'd rate it among renowned company. But it isn't as unreservedly great as I had perhaps hoped.".

	onyx:emotionText "The London Film festival screening was preceded by an entertaining but deprecatory account by Robert Gitt on the history of early sound technology and of this film in particular after references to actors speaking ultraslowly in order to minimise reverberation to dialogue dovetailed onto the start and end of alreadycompleted silent features to a finale lost to nitrate decay splices that split frames and an irreplaceable sound disc cracked into pieces by careless stacking I'd come to expect little more of the parttalkie The Barker than the status of technical curiosity. My previous experience with the genre had been limited to 1929's The Informer an excellent silent picture almost crippled by the switch into sound for its last few reels.The Barker however is nothing of the sort. It was very much better than I had been given any reason to suppose the dialogue stands comparison with anything from the talking era and the silent section is as fluent as the best of the pictures that had preceded it. Here is one film at least that managed to take the best of both worlds and produce a relatively harmonious combination.Inevitably the joins between the two styles come across with something of a jolt and the transition seems somewhat arbitrary the switch away from dialogue often appears to be triggered by violent action or strong emotion at which stage what is done or what is meant becomes more important than the minutiae of what is actually said. The truth of course is that the entire film was completed as a silent and only certain scenes pulled back for emergency rerecording before release. It was the good fortune of the producers that dialogue for these sections already existed in the form of the original play but it is a mark of the progression of sound technology in the brief interlude that the fullyassembled soundtrack could include an orchestral backing to the talkie sections which greatly eases the transitions between pure musical accompaniment and vocal scenes. There is certainly no evidence on the restored print of the physical damage to the soundtrack and the missing spliced frames are only occasionally evident as a slight jump in the picture. The only element I found obtrusive was a very obvious fake steamengine sound effect! The acting is generally excellent although I was taken aback to learn that modern consensus is that cool blonde Lou Dorothy Mackaill is far more 'natural' and attractive than dark vivacious Carrie having been told only that one was considered to have received an Oscar nomination betterdeserved by the other I naturally assumed that it was the lady with the fashionable helmet bob who had received the accolades of her contemporaries for looks and acting! I'm no Louise Brooks fan I'm afraid and the character struck me as slightly wooden with no sense of deeper passions beneath the smooth carapace I had to take the sincerity of her feelings on trust. She isn't the one who stands out from the rest of the cast for me.As the lead couple Milton Sills and Betty Compson are perfectly matched. Both are supremely in command of the silent screen conveying a world of emotional shading in a fleeting movement or a halted instant's regret yet both are entirely at home with the demands of the microphone as well Betty Compson's expressive little face needs no subtitles whether she is swigging bootleg spirits railing at or cajoling Lou scheming vengefully against Nifty or quarrelling violently with him and Sills dominates the picture in the title role. I'd never encountered him before but it was easy to see why he was a famous star of the era. His silent scenes with Carrie or his son Chris on the train are masterpieces of subtlety and body language while his talkie role  especially the nonstop breakneck barker's spiel that opens the first scene of the film  shows a man thoroughly in control of the spoken art. He manages to convey enough charisma to ensure that Nifty on the face of it a blustering domineering vulgarian retains the audience's sympathy and interest while Miss Compson likewise portrays jealous insecure Carrie as a fullyfledged character. Surprisingly  and refreshingly  the plot does not as I had anticipated with a groan feature her falling in love with the handsome young intruder whose arrival she so bitterly resents... Douglas Fairbanks Jr puts in an amazingly youthful and gangly appearance as the juvenile lead the acting comes across as a little gauche in comparison with the more experienced stars and the grin is perhaps a little selfconscious here  he had yet to grow into it  but the character himself is naive and inexperienced and the performance certainly shows ability. As a talkie debut it must have augured well for his future career.The opening of The Barker is very good indeed it starts out at an easy 810 the maximum I'd give to any film unless of exceptional impact but I did end up feeling that the quality falls off slightly towards the end into the realms of the strained and melodramatic. Even Milton Sills can't always bring off hammy dialogue with conviction in the outragedfather scenes and the whole payoff feels somewhat rushed in comparison to the gradual development of the buildup suddenly Chris is married suddenly he leaves suddenly he's back with the former 'hardboiled Hannah' transformed into an adoring and submissive housewife Show him dear. I wanted a happy ending but when Nifty collapses and then tries to go out and do his act dead drunk it seems too much of a copout to have everything come out of it smelling of roses after all.The film is good it's well worth seeing for its own sake given its technical difficulties it's excellent.

I also thought Duffy's was well suited to the tone of the movie and created several fascinating shots that I love as a film student. The credit sequence strikes me as brilliance the film raises a lots of questions of where the line between good and evil lays and about perceptions of God.

Common examples Conner jumping off a building and not breaking bonespossible but unlikely and the boys falling through the air duct after magically taking a coiled rope untying it and getting tangled in it enough that when caught would hold their weight allowing them to shoot every major boss in the Russian Mobyeah I don't buy it either but it's extremely cinematic! Some people would point to that and say divine intervention! God loves them! Yeah well God loves us all but you don't see people flying off buildings because of itwell you might but you get my drift.

It's a different kind of vigilante movie. It's particularly gory and bloody but this just makes it all the more realistic. In real life there is a significant amount of blood when someone is shot in the head. The movie has some Christian subtexts I think I've heard about five major theories about the whole movie's meaning.

However Memento uses it to keep the movie watcher guessing until the very end whereas Boondock Saints puts the pieces on the table letting you try to put them together but then will continue handing you pieces until the picture becomes clearer.Clearly the movie is designed to be overthetop both from Williem Dafoe's character to the action sequences themselves.  Williem Dafoe makes this movie for me.  The plot which centers on religiouslyinspired vigilante justice has an air of being somewhat cliched although I would be hard pressed to name another movie which handles it in this matter.I still fail to see how others consider this movie vacuous and without meaning when its message about the pitfalls of our current legal system and the need for something that transcends it is quite clear.  I thought the ending in which various people are interviewed about their opinion of the Saints and how for some vigilante justice was an incredibly sensitive issue made this point very clear.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of SpoilersAlmost all of my friends told me to watch this movie. It's so sick Great Movie It's so badass and It is in a category of it's own... well I can honestly say that The Boondock Saints was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and had it not been for Willem Dafoe it would have easily been the worst movie of all time. A title currently held by both The Exorcist II and The Amityville Horror. This movie is crap there is no way around it. The cult status it has climbed to is baffling. The fact that many people enjoy this movie is beyond the realm of human comprehension. I cannot understand. It has a lousy story line and it doesn't gel or make sense. The action is GARBAGE. I don't care what anyone says it blows. Its cheesy dull and anticlimactic... Half of the action is bad quickcut scenes zooming in on aftermath or shots of people shooting up a storm. For some reason people can't seem to shoot each other from ten feet away and while dangling upsidedown in a room full of gangsters these jerks kept their bearings and shot up the joint killing almost 10 mobsters How can they shoot so well? why can't mobsters shoot? what was holding up the rope?. Why were they so smart? why did they pack meat for a living if they could speak multiple languages? How come he didn't die after jumping off a building at least 5 stories high into an alley? What the hell was the writer thinking? The acting with the exception of Willem Dafoe why did he have to crossdress? honestly... was ghastly. The Irish accents were brutal and the overdone villains were just as horrendous. The whole we're catholic but we execute Mobsters thing was also swill. The prayer being spoken in unison was so lame!! Who writes this crap? The whole symmetric action shots of them lighting cigarettes praying shooting etc. were so corny I was ashamed of myself for watching and I was hoping nobody would come into the room and watch... I would have been reprimanded for watching such trash. The accents from the Saints were like a poor man's Mickey from Snatch...a good movie. This movie is so flawed so cheesy and so boring I was shocked after I watched it. Also another atrocity is that its being compared to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. How dare someone make that comparison? Those movies are masterpieces with good actors excellent dialogue perfect direction fitting music this movie had the worst music I think I've ever heard in a film and reasonable story lines. This movie was the polar opposite of that. Irish people should be appalled by this... anyone from Boston should be appalled by this... every person on the face of the earth should be appalled by this. What gets me the most is the alienation that people who don't like this movie feel. They become outcasts in the conversation... I Just don't get it... we need more movies like Commando Terminator Aliens Rambo Cliffhanger or Predator... hell even Marked for Death or Cobra that's right 1986 Sly Stallone is better than this. Its a sad day when people think that Matrix movies and this refuse are excellent action films. Shed a tear for a near dead genre. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you want to watch it in order to make a subsequent film look really good.   star 5. This movie is on par with Jaws 4 and Barb Wire... despicable... May god have mercy on Troy Duffy's soul.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a lovable pair the MacManus brothers are. They're Irish they're religious and they horse about at work hitting each other in the face with pieces of raw meat. What cracking fellows. Oh and in their spare time surprise surprise they drink a lot. The only problem is that some Russian Nikolai Volkov lookalikes want to buy their favourite bar. They can't be having this so they beat the guys up and set one bloke's arse on fire. It's just a bit of crack. However the Russians don't see the funny side. The day after this incident they chain one brother to the toilet and take the other down to the street to kill him. But then the chained brother frees himself and from the top of the apartment building looking down onto the alley he drops the toilet down onto the head of the Russian shooter a man who is cackling like a cartoon villain and then jumps several stories down onto the other hitting him with remarkable precision. Then the brother that is still conscious beats the Russians to death with fragments of the toilet. As if it needed stating the film is a load of crap.Watching The Boondock Saints is kind of like performing a DIY lobotomy. You lie down on the sofa and relax and by the end of the ordeal you're a drooling shambling glassyeyed zombie. It's just a shame it's so hard to find a big Chief to put you out of your misery once the credits have rolled.But what makes the film so bad? Well the idiotic morality doesn't help. Apparently it's okay to kill people as long as you think they're evil and as long as you believe in god. But what constitutes evil? Well instead of going after politicians corporations and religious leaders the brothers decide to kill gangsters. Well fair enough they're bad guys but the brothers themselves aren't any better. They manhandle women they terrorise priests and their best mate gropes the breasts of an unconscious woman. Wow these are such great guys. However their dumb mate makes up for the groping by slaughtering more wicked men. So that makes it alright then.But their dumb mate a 'reformed' Italian gangster also threatens his girlfriend with a gun. Remember he's on the side of the righteous. And earlier on in his life he stood by and watched a man slaughter an entire family. Of course this nonresponse is justified by him being scared. However at the very beginning a priest says that the indifference of good men is just as bad as the evil of wicked men. Therefore with this bloke turning a blind eye to violence and then embracing it he's surely doubly evil.Another stupid moral detail is that the brothers are supposedly protecting the Irish community. Yet this is a community in the film that is proud of not talking to the police. That's more indifference. So why should I give a tinker's fart about a community that wont help itself and which takes pride in allowing gangsters the church is certainly included in this as they're the biggest gangsters of all take control of their lives? But the most dubious piece of morality occurs at the end. The two brothers and Billy Connolly terrorise a court while spouting religious claptrap. Apparently they're right and you're wrong. You have to do what they say. These are not polite suggestions. These are codes of behaviour. So do I get shot if I use prophylactics? I mean the Pope hates those things and he's god's messenger on Earth.But although I could spend ages ripping the religious nonsense to shreds the film also fails spectacularly in terms of entertainment. For instance there's the idiotic way it's filmed. Basically you go from crime scene to crime scene and then in flashback you see the murder itself in mindnumbing slowmotion. It's incredibly repetitive. And Willem Defoe's character the FBI agent who's assigned the case is a cheap rip off of Gary Oldman's character in Leon  he listens to classical music as he puts everything together he also reaches for the sky in ecstasy when he solves puzzles. But to try and add some colour the character is gay. However for some reason despite being fierce Catholics the brothers don't mind this fact. They call him a good man. Maybe it's because he's the sort of homosexual who just loves bum sex  he doesn't like hugging. But again it's further evidence of the way the brothers pick and choose what's good and what's bad  of course we all do this but most of us aren't going to shoot people if we don't agree with their personal choices.What's really bad though is the action. There's one scene where the brothers and their mate are standing there having a shootout with Billy Connolly. No one moves but even at point blank range no one can hit the target. And what makes it even more stupid is that Connolly's character is supposed to be a lethal killing machine he's kept in prison like Hannibal Lector. Someone give him some shooting lessons.And then there's the scene where the brothers fall out of an air duct and hanging from a rope manage to kill a bunch of gangsters. Only someone with an IQ lower than Forest Gump could find any merit in that.And the less said about the scene where Defoe reenacts a shootout by using his fingers as guns the better.But what makes this film so depressing is that it seems to have such a strong following. I have no idea what they see in the film because all I see is rightwing religious claptrap fed to the audience through idiotic characters and preposterous situations. To admit to liking this film is to admit to being an imbecile.".

There's one scene where the brothers and their mate are standing there having a shootout with Billy Connolly. No one moves but even at point blank range no one can hit the target. And what makes it even more stupid is that Connolly's character is supposed to be a lethal killing machine he's kept in prison like Hannibal Lector. Someone give him some shooting lessons.And then there's the scene where the brothers fall out of an air duct and hanging from a rope manage to kill a bunch of gangsters. Only someone with an IQ lower than Forest Gump could find any merit in that.And the less said about the scene where Defoe reenacts a shootout by using his fingers as guns the better.But what makes this film so depressing is that it seems to have such a strong following. I have no idea what they see in the film because all I see is rightwing religious claptrap fed to the audience through idiotic characters and preposterous situations. To admit to liking this film is to admit to being an imbecile.";

I saw the unrated edition of The Boondock Saints two days ago and I'm still reeling in from the experience which is surreal to tell you the truth. Quite frankly a movie that is this sharply written acted and directed is a true rarity these days. Writerdirector Troy Duffy dives into the murkiest depths of the law and its apparent futility in modern times and how it takes two Irish fraternal twin brothers Conner and Murphy Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus  both of whom are a little too convincing in their roles to stir up enough debate about vigilantism to become media heroes. The release of The Boondock Saints was sidelined in 1999 because of the Columbine massacre and the plot about Conner and Murphy being on a mission from God draws some eerie parallels to the motives of Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. As the film opens in Boston after St. Patrick's Day Conner and Murphy get into a barroom brawl with a couple of Russian toughs and said toughs are discovered the next morning in an alley in piles of their own blood and guts. FBI agent Paul Smecker Willem Dafoe shows up on the scene to show the local cops a thing or two about criminology and theorizes it was a revenge killing. Soon enough both injured brothers waltz into the police station and claim selfdefense. They're let off after a night in jail plus experience a cathartic jailcell baptism and no charges filed. But soon more bodies turn up and Smecker learns that Conner and Murphy and a third David Della Rocco may be the ones behind the mayhem on the streets. Duffy's film is a bloody one most of the gruesome violence is extended in the unrated special edition with a cackling screenplay that includes 246 uses of the fword and assorted IrishEuroslang and has earned a fearsome reputation in recent years and has been embraced as a cult phenomenon. It's easy to see why if one is a fan of relentless violence and bloodshed. P.S. The action is so balletic in its style and excess that it's almost reminiscent of a John Woo picture. I can't believe I stood away from this movie for so long darn it! The opening moments don't prepare you for what comes up next and even though the action which there is quite a bit of and as stated earlier is extended in the unrated version is quite bloody there's a morbid sense of humor running throughout the carnage and I fell out laughing on more than one occasion during this picture. And still there is a sense of beauty and tragedy underlying much of the action in The Boondock Saints and its ending will certainly leave a bitter taste in the mouths of some. Lastly I would recommend reading up on as much about the controversy surrounding The Boondock Saints as one possibly can it'll make the experience much more hypnotic.1010".

And on first glance it does look like a decent movie. But when you look closer it becomes extremely apparent that it's all flash and no substance. Duffy masks the contrived plot and silly inexplicable motives for characters with violence. Characters become superheroes on a whim no one is developed to the point where emotional development has zero impact. Instead the film plays up the emotional moments as overthetop as possible to cram that emotional value into your head.There are very admirable performances in the film by Billy Connolly and Willam Dafoe but the problem here is in the direction and the writing. Some of the most absurd moments come from the direction of the actors. For instance the scene in which Willam Dafoe attempts to reenact the shootout between the Saints and the Duke doesn't pack the emotional punch that Duffy intends it only comes off as silly and clich. The best you can hope for in this film are some brief funny moments and a lot of nonsense that you'll have to wade through that it's really just not worth it.Ultimately the film can be summed up with a quote from the movie itself Movies. You see this in bad movies. Even if Miramax had picked the film up and set the budget at 15 million like the original plan it still would have fallen to pieces due to Duffy's incompetence as a director.As a big stupid action movie it's mediocre. As the movie that was supposed to save the industry it's weak even by dumb action film standards. There are plenty of better movies so why rally around this one?".

	schema:reviewBody "I suppose I can see how so many people could've been hoodwinked into thinking this was a good movie. It just piles a bunch of cool imagery and ideas together and flings them onto the screen. Boondock Saints is one of the more shallow bits of cinema to cross my path in a while. The twins are fantastic shots when hanging upside down from twisted rope while spinning and wearing ski masks. But line them up in front of one man in broad daylight and they're lucky to escape with their lives. Speaking of shallow cool and that particular gunfight... It looks cool when a man opens his overcoat to reveal a vest with 6 holsters each containing a badass looking handgun in slowmotion. So while he's constantly running out of bullets and lightningquick whipping out a new gun the twins have their divine guns that never need to be reloaded. That's one of the main problems with this movie it can't decide if it's going to be one of those reload during a gunfight flicks or a just keep shooting and never run out of bullets flicks. Just when you think the movie's going to laugh at itself THERE WAS A FIREFIGHT!!!!!!! it actually shows you that it doesn't get its own joke.As far as the murky morality goes it wants to come across as leaving the judgement as to whether the twins are right or wrong to the viewer. But the camera and the script love these Irish rogues a little too much. Lingering on their nakedness their wicked grins and their righteousness a little too long.Willem Dafoe is a great actor and he does his best with the unfortunate script. But behind every great actor is a great director and Dafoe's performance makes me think Duffy was never there to reign in Dafoe's fantastic imagination and energy.Finally I can understand the need for Rocco's character the twins need a spaz around so they look even cooler by comparison. But did the actor have to suck SO MUCH?".

	schema:reviewBody "Go ahead. Accuse me of being a square who just doesn't get it but for the love of god please read the review before you get overly sensitive and click no! I never heard anybody talking about this movie. I only saw it because a website where I usually go to look up recent movies kept promoting this garbage so I sat down and watched this rubbish out of curiosityfor free...what you'd think Id' actually pay to see this?. There goes two hours of my life that I will never get back. I rushed to Amazon.com to see the reviews but much to my dismay it has a four and a half star average on Amazon. I went to IMDb.com and my jaw hit the floor. This movie is in the top 250! I had to get surgery to keep my jaw off the floor.All bad jokes aside this movie is so terrible that it defines bad. Its not even enjoyable in its badness like some movies can be. Its so terrible that it makes you give up hope on life. Yes its THAT bad. The whole movie is about two idiotic Irish brothers ConnorSean Patrick Flanery and MurphyNorman Reedus that decide that they are ordained to kill evil men in South Boston. Thats the whole movie in a nutshell plus throw in a stupid plot twist involving the homicidal hit man trying to kill them being their father. Willem Dafoe must have been blackmailed to appear in this monstrosity of a film as a homophobic homosexual FBI agent. I don't see any other reason an actor of his talent should appear in this socalled movie.The acting is dreadful. Norman Reedus played a decent bad guy in Dueces Wild but he sucks here. Sean Patrick Flanery is just as bad and David Della Rocco needs to be kept away from every movie studio with armed guardstanks and rottweilers for safety reasons. He is just that awful. Willem Dafoe chews scenery like a locust. Now we all know that Willem Dafoe is up there with all the great actors like Denzel Washington Al Pacino Robert De Niro Edward Norton Tim Roth Morgan Freeman Gene Hackman Kevin Spacey Harvey Keitel and the slew of others. We all know that Willem Dafoe even shines when he is in a movie that is a total train wreckThink State Of The Union but not here. in this movie he is reduced to a goofy FBI agent that reenacts each crime scene while channeling Jim Carrey and Dame Edna in a performance that is so over the top that its eyebrowraising for all the wrong reasons. The film is a total bore and its blatant attempt to rip off films of Quentin Tarantino Luc Besson and Guy Ritchie come off as pitiful more than flattering.The acting and the action scenes are not the only things that suck. Nobody in this movie seems to speak a coherent language and most of the time are using cheesy action quips that nobody says. Not even in action flicks! They say this movie is styleoversubstance. I agree that there is no substance but there is also no style either. Style wise this movie is like a guy wearing a plaid suit with a Buffalo Bills hat and Florsheim shoes. He'd like to think he was cool but he's not. This movie has achieved cult status. You have no idea how sad that makes me feel. Whatever happen to movies rightfully earning a cult fanbase. This movie gained fans off an obscene amount of hype and we all know its true.All of you reasonable people out there PLEASE tell people the truth about this moviescrew what your friends will think of you. Tell the people that this movie is incredibly bad so that they can save themselves the torture of having to sit through a movie that can only be enjoyed by people who sniff glue. Two thumbs all the way down.To the director Troy Duffy Don't even think about making a sequel to this dollar bin bust you talentless stool bucket!!!".

There goes two hours of my life that I will never get back. I rushed to Amazon.com to see the reviews but much to my dismay it has a four and a half star average on Amazon. I went to IMDb.com and my jaw hit the floor. This movie is in the top 250! I had to get surgery to keep my jaw off the floor.All bad jokes aside this movie is so terrible that it defines bad. Its not even enjoyable in its badness like some movies can be. Its so terrible that it makes you give up hope on life. Yes its THAT bad. The whole movie is about two idiotic Irish brothers ConnorSean Patrick Flanery and MurphyNorman Reedus that decide that they are ordained to kill evil men in South Boston. Thats the whole movie in a nutshell plus throw in a stupid plot twist involving the homicidal hit man trying to kill them being their father. Willem Dafoe must have been blackmailed to appear in this monstrosity of a film as a homophobic homosexual FBI agent. I don't see any other reason an actor of his talent should appear in this socalled movie.The acting is dreadful. Norman Reedus played a decent bad guy in Dueces Wild but he sucks here. Sean Patrick Flanery is just as bad and David Della Rocco needs to be kept away from every movie studio with armed guardstanks and rottweilers for safety reasons. He is just that awful. Willem Dafoe chews scenery like a locust. Now we all know that Willem Dafoe is up there with all the great actors like Denzel Washington Al Pacino Robert De Niro Edward Norton Tim Roth Morgan Freeman Gene Hackman Kevin Spacey Harvey Keitel and the slew of others. We all know that Willem Dafoe even shines when he is in a movie that is a total train wreckThink State Of The Union but not here. in this movie he is reduced to a goofy FBI agent that reenacts each crime scene while channeling Jim Carrey and Dame Edna in a performance that is so over the top that its eyebrowraising for all the wrong reasons. The film is a total bore and its blatant attempt to rip off films of Quentin Tarantino Luc Besson and Guy Ritchie come off as pitiful more than flattering.The acting and the action scenes are not the only things that suck. Nobody in this movie seems to speak a coherent language and most of the time are using cheesy action quips that nobody says. Not even in action flicks! They say this movie is styleoversubstance. I agree that there is no substance but there is also no style either. Style wise this movie is like a guy wearing a plaid suit with a Buffalo Bills hat and Florsheim shoes. He'd like to think he was cool but he's not. This movie has achieved cult status. You have no idea how sad that makes me feel. Whatever happen to movies rightfully earning a cult fanbase. This movie gained fans off an obscene amount of hype and we all know its true.All of you reasonable people out there PLEASE tell people the truth about this moviescrew what your friends will think of you. Tell the people that this movie is incredibly bad so that they can save themselves the torture of having to sit through a movie that can only be enjoyed by people who sniff glue. Two thumbs all the way down.To the director Troy Duffy Don't even think about making a sequel to this dollar bin bust you talentless stool bucket!!!";

	schema:reviewBody "There's nothing more frustrating than somebody who doesn't get the joke. The punchline rolls by and he's left sitting theregazing awkwardly into space struggling to figure it all out. Troy Duffy's first feature film The Boondock Saints rests in that type of eternal limbo. At first glance it seems to bounce back and forth from payoff to payoff giving the audience a good deal to chuckle about. But as the film keeps rolling we begin to get the feeling that The Boondock Saints is becoming chokedup by its own gag. Halfway through the uncomfortable silence of an unrealized ruse seeps into the room. And sadly it becomes apparent that the filmmakers don't quite get their own joke.The Boondock Saints is a simplistically rendered adultmale fairytale. Whereas children relish in tales of knights and princesses Duffy makes his Camelot a kingdom adorned with stylized hitman and generic mafiosos. Two Irish Brothers Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus attempt to save the world from the evil and the corrupt by becoming what else? the embodiment of a Tarantino fanboy's fantasy. Adorned with dark sunglasses and nifty accents the MacManus twins strut around the streets of Boston muttering pleasing Catholic prayers in a futile attempt to somehow try to veil their inherent vacancy. Amidst all the good natured killing is a gay cop played by Willem Dafoe with bombastic comedic zest who is attempting to stop these vigilantes with hearts of gold. Dafoe's charactereasily the most charismatic of the bunchis a walking talking caricature. He smiles and slaps around his compatriots all the while flicking his bouffant into the air like a swimsuit model leaving the ocean.This is all not to say that The Boondock Saints is a complete failure. Sure it's overthetop but at least there are plenty of gun shootouts and interesting carnage to keep the ball rolling. The slightly nonlinear story is managed well. As Dafoe handles one crime scene we get to see the whole shindig played out in realtime. It's a slowmotion gunfighter's dream! Bodies fall and bullets soar as Dafoe reenacts the entire massacre with emphatic precision.The true problem with the film is that it is so engrossed in its own mythos that it actually takes itself seriously. This becomes apparent as haunting cathedral choir musical adorns the madness with Gothic foreboding. All the while we're shaking our head wondering why Duffy isn't capable of accepting the ridiculousness of his own creation. Heck even porn star Ron Jeremy enters the fray but the movie doesn't pause to giggleinstead it continuously plugs along with repetitive and ruthless abandon. It seems that Duffy actually believes that not only is what the MacManus brothers doing rightbut that it is actually possible. In that sense The Boondock Saints is like the elephant in the roomthe dinner party guess who fails to get the big joke. And not surprisingly the audience isn't laughing.".

Ten minutes into the movie I was so disappointed I wanted to turn it off. But I held in there for the full duration of the movie just so I could write a review about it today.Well here's the premise two Irish Catholic brothers in South Boston on an apparent mission from GOD start killing members of a Russian mafia.  Willem Dafoe a clever FBI agent is sent in to investigate but ends up admiring the brothers.  Written and directed by any other person this story would have been incredible.  Instead in the hands of Troy Duffy the story was reduced to the level of a madeforTV movie.  All the stars in the film overracted.  Yes unfortunately even Willem Dafoe.  The most blatant overacting however was done by Rocco the funny man mobster.  He wasn't very funny though he told one racist joke that drew a chuckle out of me. Besides the overacting there were horrible cliches I couldn't stomach.  For example Willem Dafoe is a gay FBI agent.  This was milked for laughs several times during the movie.  At one point he calls his lover a fag and the bartender at a gay bar a fairy.  Why this was included in the movie is beyond me especially the scene in the gay bar.  It just didn't fit but I guess the director found all of this comedic.  Another cliche was the old Irish bartender with Tourette's Syndrome.  In the beginning of the movie he curses infront of nuns in a hospital.  Yeah I know could it get any worst?  I could not stomach this movie.  The comedy was less than mediocre the story was underdeveloped the acting was terrible and the cliches gave me a headache.  I cannot understand the appeal of a movie like this.

Quick fast paced camera work and excellent photography helps to move the story along. The action is nonstop and the dialogue though very offensive alot of the f word is right on target for the setting and mood of the movie.The showdown at the end is a little less intense then the rest of the movie but still nonetheless works!The relationship between the two brothers is right on.  Flannery and Remmus really do act like 2 brothers the fighting in the air shaft hilarious.One of the main highlights of the movie is the performance given by Willem Dafoe.  Diverse witty and totally hilarious.  He delivers and excellent performance as the FBI agent.  He is intelligent comical gay and doesn't want to admit it right off the top but agrees with what the brothers are doing.  He had me laughing throuh the film...and seeing him in Drag...Oh you just gotta see this movie.Though some plot points weren't totally developed what happened to Fk Ass? this movie is still an excellent example of a lower budget movie that really kicks ass and offers a fast paced action packed joy ride.Check this movie out...It is well worth the time.  I would like to get the DVD and watch all the extra's that are on it.  I would also like to get my hands on an uncut version.9 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "There's the original version released in 1986 and on videotape and the 2002 Director's Cut available on DVD. The latter version is one of my alltime favorite movies. It compares quite favorably with Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and is a modern classic.The theatrical release of 1986 shamefully butchered chopped up and badly reedited by the mindless suits at Warner and with its original Jerry Goldsmith score replaced by the rather trite Tangerine Dream soundtrack is the version most people have seen. It was released on videotape as a children's movie. What it is and was intended to be is a fairy tale for adults. In fact it's too intense for really young children.It's hard to say that the '86 version deserves any more than the 6 it's rated at on its IMDb main page. It is a disappointment primarily because it's now impossible to watch without think how much better it could be. The feeling and tone of the film were ruined by its treatment.The Ridley Scott Director's Cut released in 2002 is a completely different movie. If you haven't seen this version you haven't seen the movie. It deserves a score of 9 or 10. It doesn't look like a movie made 20 years ago. Scenes which are vital to the tone of the film and the meaning of the story have been restored. The sumptuous original soundtrack recorded with a full orchestra has also been restored and this adds more to the film than can be put into words. About the performances A very young Tom Cruise is excellent as the hero. Tim Curry as the Lord of Darkness is awesome his costume and voice alone are worth the cost of renting or buying the DVD. Mia Sara is absolutely stunning as Lily. She actually plays two different versions of her character both wonderfully. This was her first role a risk for Scott on such a big budget film and she turned in the performance of her career. She's never been better or looked more beautiful than in this movie. The elves and fairies both good and evil are incredibly reallooking and believable. The costumes are perfect and the sets are breathtaking literally. One of the largest indoor sets ever constructed  a huge fantasy forest  was built for this movie.If you haven't seen this version rent it. If you have kids buy it for them they'll watch it over and over. My daughter and her friends watch it repeatedly she's probably seen it 50 times.".

	onyx:emotionText "There's the original version released in 1986 and on videotape and the 2002 Director's Cut available on DVD. The latter version is one of my alltime favorite movies. It compares quite favorably with Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and is a modern classic.The theatrical release of 1986 shamefully butchered chopped up and badly reedited by the mindless suits at Warner and with its original Jerry Goldsmith score replaced by the rather trite Tangerine Dream soundtrack is the version most people have seen. It was released on videotape as a children's movie. What it is and was intended to be is a fairy tale for adults. In fact it's too intense for really young children.It's hard to say that the '86 version deserves any more than the 6 it's rated at on its IMDb main page. It is a disappointment primarily because it's now impossible to watch without think how much better it could be. The feeling and tone of the film were ruined by its treatment.The Ridley Scott Director's Cut released in 2002 is a completely different movie. If you haven't seen this version you haven't seen the movie. It deserves a score of 9 or 10. It doesn't look like a movie made 20 years ago. Scenes which are vital to the tone of the film and the meaning of the story have been restored. The sumptuous original soundtrack recorded with a full orchestra has also been restored and this adds more to the film than can be put into words. About the performances A very young Tom Cruise is excellent as the hero. Tim Curry as the Lord of Darkness is awesome his costume and voice alone are worth the cost of renting or buying the DVD. Mia Sara is absolutely stunning as Lily. She actually plays two different versions of her character both wonderfully. This was her first role a risk for Scott on such a big budget film and she turned in the performance of her career. She's never been better or looked more beautiful than in this movie. The elves and fairies both good and evil are incredibly reallooking and believable. The costumes are perfect and the sets are breathtaking literally. One of the largest indoor sets ever constructed  a huge fantasy forest  was built for this movie.If you haven't seen this version rent it. If you have kids buy it for them they'll watch it over and over. My daughter and her friends watch it repeatedly she's probably seen it 50 times.";

I guess it boils down to what your imagination can be hopefully transfered to film for you enjoyment.I've seen my fair share of fantasy films in my life and Legend probably reached to that part of me quicker than any film of that genre than has been done before and since. Lord of the Rings surpasses it on many levels...but Legeng still has the ability after all these years to make me think of pure fantasy and that's what I believe this film is about. Good vs evil is what most films are about but Legend is what fairies and goblins and a mystical forests are! Visually I doubt you can find much better even 20 odd years later! Good vs evil in a setting that is set in a purer forum. Character development here are not too strong but they're not meant to be. They are strong enough to portray love vs evil vs good and bad and they do it well in the context of the story. Tom Cruise did a good Job as the Nieve and yet courageous Jack Lily was a the prize of his longing and it came across as undeniable. Mia Sara as lily is the stuff of youthful longing.Tim Curry played the spoiler and he did it to the point of stealing all of the film. He is the stuff of fantasy. The costume was spectacular and his portrayal of the character was commanding...And over the top cause that what he does well! I enjoyed the directors cut film more as it is longer and tells the story just a little better but I enjoyed Tangarines Dream's score more as it captured the mood of fantasy  for me as set in a mystical place! Jerry Goldsmith had some very good moments but TD for me layed out a fairytale with my eyes closed better. But at the end you either see this for the pure fantasy it is about or you see it as something deeper that it doesn't pretend to be. It's much purer in it's view on good vs evil and to my taste it hits on every level of that platform. And not to mention it's ability to make for a great dream filled with hope and danger.Pure fantasy...and should be viewed with that intent.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will join the chorus... This is a beautiful and thoroughly enjoyable fantasy film as long as you watch it in digital widescreen and do not bother with the 1hr 30min version. The Director's Cutbetter known as the European release is worthy of an IMDb rating of 8. The American theatrical release is worthy of a 6.5.This is a fairly straightforward fantasy conceived and directed by Ridley Scott one of the greatest mainstream directors of our time. The story follows a young man who lives in a forest Jack played by Tom Cruise and a spirited young princess Lily  Mia Sara who is in love with him. The lord of darkness Tim Curry has sent forth his minions to capture the last two remaining unicorns so that he can banish light from the world forever. Unicorns are attracted to innocence and so they find themselves in Jack and Lily's company just as the dark lord's play begins to unfold. Before long Jack and his magical forest friends must save Lily the one remaining unicorn and the world from the grasp of the dark lord at any price.Even the lengthier director's cut goes by just a little too quickly. But it's pace is not comparable to the incredibly hasty studio chopjob of the American release. The story is epic but the medium is not. All considered however the production team did a great job given the length limits afforded for the film.Cruise does pretty well with a role that must have been a little hard to interpret. Jack must behave as a hero a young man who has learned most of his lessons from nature and a teenager to varying degrees throughout the film. Mia Sara is delightful a Lily. Tim Curry and David Bennent Honeythorn Gump get pretty close to stealing the show. In all the acting is fine but the star of the film is really the camera.Scott has often proved his ability to create immersive experiences in worlds which are somewhat alien no pun intended to his audience. Legend does this perhaps as powerfully as his most farout films Alien and Bladerunner. The cinematography editing and special effects are exceptionally good and make the fairly average plot glow. Each scene is a work of art.Highly recommended for fantasy fans Ridley Scott Tim Curry and Mia Sara fans and those interested in artfully presented effects. Recommended for fans of Pan's Labyrinth and Mirrormask. Weakly recommended for Tom Cruise fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ridley Scotts' fallen masterpiece Legend has in it's own rite become one of the most infamous if not fascinating legacies in Hollywood. In 1984 Ridley Scott director of the famed scifi Alien set out to tell a defining fairy tale. Once he was joined by writer William Hjortsberg the duo started off on a creative journey to conjure what would become the beloved film Legend. The film was further more given the appropriate elements for the general fairy tale. The Princess the Hero the Villain the Goblins the Fairies and the other magical characters and creatures such as the Unicorns and Honeythorn Gump. Seeing as the film is intended to be a definitive fairy tale this would also mean tracing the modern genre back to its' roots Grim style. Indeed the completed product was pure in it's woven fables. Just as it is tender and bright is it also dark surreal nightmarish and ultimately entrancing. More of the film deals with the overshadow of darkness in the magical land. A proper way to show the sudden switch from light and happy to dark and fearsome indeed.In the story we have the world happy beautiful completely compelling in its' own nature. The dark truth lies within its' own reality. Darkness once ruled the world but has since retreated into the lower levels of the earth to groan and complain of times in a better existence. The world is happy because the Unicorn a very dear and sacred animal rules the land. These gorgeous creatures know only love and laughter and thusly protect the world from evil. They are attracted to one element in man kind innocence. Princes Lily is pure at heart as well as mind and spirit. Her soul friend Jack leads her to the creatures as a gesture of love and affection. Quite unfortunately however the Lord Darkness has sent his own army after the creatures too. Once both sides are at the right place and the wrong time the Unicorns are harmed and the earth in danger. Thus begins a journey full of action adventure and suspense.Tom Cruise has only performed well in this one film for me anyway. He is actually quite affective and believable as the hero Jack. He shows both strength and bravery to contrast with confusion and fear of the unknown. Very plausible indeed. Mia Sara is so gorgeous naive and pure as the Princess. Her characteristics consist of a blind ambition love stricken playfulness and of course Innocence. Never has this genre seen such a perfect portrayal. Now Tim Curry turns in one hell of a performance. Thanks to modern filmmaking Curry is a frightening disgusting and yet sexual portrayal of ultimate Darkness. The three stars are all mixed together in a real Fairy Tale with a message at the end. note this message is only seen in the 2002 restored Directors Cut.I do not feel the need to bring up the controversy that ensued the principal photography as it is well known by fans and film buffs of all kind. What I can say is that Ridley Scott was certainly determined to give us the product of his imagination. That said he gave us a real fantasy. he has given us a real story of magic love hateadventure and all kinds of elements that create what a film like this should be. One thing to truly be mentioned however is the late Jerry Goldsmith. This master at film composition of the musical persuasion gave us his ultimate best and that was being generous and forgetting about getting stabbed in the back during the processing of Alien. Again the great musician was tricked and his beautiful score was thrown out the window from US versions leaving the film to sugary and sappy. Even worse important scenes were cut leaving much of the film uneven and seemingly rushed. Sad enough this kind of treatment happened a year earlier with 1984's Supergirl. Fortunately however we were given the true version of the film in mid 2002 and rightly so. The film has since then been seen and loved by fans as myself who loved it way back when....as well as now.The best I can say is that this movie has a full blown mastermind to it and the producers and creators etc finally gave the film justice. Same happened with Supergirl in 2000. Bottom line this film is brilliant and touching and an ever glorious masterpiece!".

He shows both strength and bravery to contrast with confusion and fear of the unknown. Very plausible indeed. Mia Sara is so gorgeous naive and pure as the Princess. Her characteristics consist of a blind ambition love stricken playfulness and of course Innocence. Never has this genre seen such a perfect portrayal. Now Tim Curry turns in one hell of a performance. Thanks to modern filmmaking Curry is a frightening disgusting and yet sexual portrayal of ultimate Darkness. The three stars are all mixed together in a real Fairy Tale with a message at the end. note this message is only seen in the 2002 restored Directors Cut.I do not feel the need to bring up the controversy that ensued the principal photography as it is well known by fans and film buffs of all kind. What I can say is that Ridley Scott was certainly determined to give us the product of his imagination. That said he gave us a real fantasy. he has given us a real story of magic love hateadventure and all kinds of elements that create what a film like this should be. One thing to truly be mentioned however is the late Jerry Goldsmith. This master at film composition of the musical persuasion gave us his ultimate best and that was being generous and forgetting about getting stabbed in the back during the processing of Alien. Again the great musician was tricked and his beautiful score was thrown out the window from US versions leaving the film to sugary and sappy. Even worse important scenes were cut leaving much of the film uneven and seemingly rushed. Sad enough this kind of treatment happened a year earlier with 1984's Supergirl. Fortunately however we were given the true version of the film in mid 2002 and rightly so. The film has since then been seen and loved by fans as myself who loved it way back when....as well as now.The best I can say is that this movie has a full blown mastermind to it and the producers and creators etc finally gave the film justice. Same happened with Supergirl in 2000. Bottom line this film is brilliant and touching and an ever glorious masterpiece!";

What I mean by this is that while the effects sets and visuals of the time were outstanding the movie was not meant to attract just anyone. It was not a movie that claims familiar sensations and thoughts except the good vs evil basis but that branches out into the most wild reaches of the imagination. This is a 'cult' movie because its display is fantastic.The themes are simple. Good versus evil hero and villain a world of fantasy true love. But what the director accomplished was deeper more disturbing darker and so much more pleasing to the eyes then you could expect from a 'fairytale'. Even when the scenes are cheerful and bright you sense how fragile it is and how mortal the characters are. And when the scenes are dark and evil you can not shield your eyes or feel afraid. You are drawn and can not look away.It was these effects that played with the mind just the way a fantasy should. You must be left in awe and confusion and still curious for more.The actors were great Cruise unfortunately being my least favorite choice and Tim Curry and the boy who played the Forest Sprite being the absolute best. The costumes makeup and set are superb.One of my 'must sees' for those who not only love 'cult' movies but who love to feel the movie to be a part of it and to be left inspired.".

You hear a song you get visual images in your head and make a movie of your own.However ...I do have to say that the American Version with Tangerine Dream's soundtrack only makes this movie into a Cult film. It could have been great but well you fill in the blank.Fortunately I've seen the way it was SUPPOSED to have been released in the States which you can find on the 2disc DVD which has both versions.The NonAmerican version has a story which is much fuller and the music with a full symphony orchestra is much better and adds more drama and punctuates the mood of each scene more properly.I do find the American version's end much more climatic musically and storywise with Jon Anderson singer of Yes's angelic voice thundering with Tangerine Dream's score in the background.So pick an afternoon when you got about 4 hours to spare and watch BOTH. Then take parts of each version and make YOUR OWN wonderous story.And another thing keep in mind that this movie came out a whole 20 years ago. The early 80's. Next year it can buy it's own beer if it was a person. So Tim Curry and a lot of others would have been just voices over CGI characters instead of being in actual makeup and there would have been MORE to the story and script if CGI was as available back then as it is now.There IS such a thing as knowing limitations you know.American Version good enough to make one wonder what was more.International Version done much better and fuller though I like the American ending betterAs I said watch both versions and make your OWN version to enjoy.Aaaaannnd ...

	schema:reviewBody "'Legend' The Director's Cut 19852002 Unrated One Hour  54 Minutes and U.S. Theatrical Version 1986 Rated PG by the MPAA One Hour  30 Minutes. Content includes Mild Adult Language Some Mild Sexual Innuendos Violence and Some Disturbing Imagery.My Take  Out of  or 610 on the IMDb Scale.'Legend' is triumph of art direction makeup costume and set design. It's a great movie to look at but not much else. That goes for both versions of the picture The Director's Cut or the U.S. Theatrical Version.'Legend' wants to be a mythical fairy tale. It tells of Darkness Tim Curry a demonic overlord who has been banished from the world to his dark kingdom to reign in exile. The world is a beautiful place of perpetual springtime complete with sunshine tweeting birds pollen in the air and tree blossoms in abundance. The world is kept pure and protected by two unicorns who both harbor goodness truth and light.However Darkness is plotting his return to the world for a hostile takeover. If his lackeys can take out the two unicorns then Darkness will once again rise to dominate the world. This is not very appealing to Jack Tom Cruise a young man who lives in a storybook forest. Jack shares a romance of innocence with the lovely maiden Lily Mia Sara. When Darkness makes his move for world domination the world is plunged into a chaotic dark winter. Darkness kidnaps Lily to corrupt her and make her his dark bride. It's up to Jack and his motley crew of fairy friends to put the kabash on Darkness before all hope is lost . . .Sounds like the groundwork for a fun picture doesn't it? Unfortunately that's not the case. For as visually arousing as the film is it's highly underdeveloped. 'Legend' is all style with no substance. That's too bad. Everything looks great and the adventure could have been a really great one too.One problem with 'Legend' is you don't care about anyone or anything in it. There's nothing interesting funny witty or imaginative about any of the characters except for maybe Darkness. We've all seen this kind of story before Evil is out to vanquish good the young lad becomes a hero to save the girl and set the wrong things right. It's a timeless story. No doubt we'll keep seeing it time and time again. When it's done right we love it. A good example would be the original 'Star Wars' 1977. But 'Legend' doesn't do it right. We're not gripped in the slightest.Tom Cruise as Jack spends a great deal of the picture looking scared or bewildered. Sara Mia better known as Matthew Broderick's girlfriend in 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' 1986 is an adequate damsel in distress. Naive but nice. The scene stealer is Tim Curry as Darkness. He looks great! He is layered in makeup and paint but he truly looks like the devil complete with gigantic horns goat ears red skin yellow eyes a Charles Atlas figure and goat legs. Oddly enough Curry's performance shines though the latex making Darkness convincing as a sinister presence.As indicated the rest of the characters are fairly one dimensional clichs from other  better fantasy tales. They're only here as plot devices completely devoid of any other purpose to get you through the movie from Point 'A' to Point 'B'. You don't care for them or empathize with them in any way or about their plight. To make a movie like this work you should at least care about the outcome of it's characters. If you don't then what's the point of watching it in the first place? The Director's Cut is more whimsical. It's about 24 minutes longer and has extended dialog with longer scenes. Most notably this version firmly establishes the lovely Lily as a princess while the American version is decidedly ambiguous about her background. Also notable is Lily's singing in the forest and to the unicorns. This is more storybook like and I suppose this behavior is to be expected of maidens.The Director's Cut boasts a lyrical score by Jerry Goldsmith. It's beautifully done and serves the storybook aspect of 'Legend' very well.The U.S. version is scored by the rock group Tangerine Dream. What I liked about this score is that it's a departure from what is traditionally heard in this kind of picture. I thought this score was a fresh approach to the 'fairytale''storybook' genre.Director Ridley Scott has described his director's version of 'Legend' as being the more sophisticated of the two versions. In some ways he's right. Then again both versions of the picture are rather muddled and lack coherence or any real direction. Both pictures feel choppy unrealized and cobbled together from other fantasies minus the spark that makes the good ones work in the first place.Does 'Legend' have a saving grace? It's a visual rollercoaster. It's great to look at. It reminds me of fantasy paintings that have come to life. Too bad that the life we see in the movie is lifeless. If you can get around that fact then either version of 'Legend' at it's best will be excellent eye candy with terrific cinemaphotography and great music whether it's Goldsmith or Tangerine Dream as the music provider. In my opinion The Director's Cut and the U.S. Theatrical Version are on they same par in terms of quality. One is not better then the other. 'Legend' isn't that good to begin with. To be fair it's not bad either. If it wasn't for the film's visual style there would really be no reason to even consider watching this picture. 'Legend' is a missed opportunity that left me wanting more from it then what I was given . . .".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of the first fantasy films I ever saw growing up and it had a lasting impression on me for many reasons least of all the visuals which are like all of Scott's films wellcrafted and almost illustrative in their design. What really stuck out was the mythic quality of it all and even at a young age the undeniably sexual overtones in the exchanges between the Lord of Darkness and Lily. I think people don't give kids enough credit but they do pick up on these things. I remember being taken aback when Lily's character dons the rather revealing dress late in the film and being shocked at her general demeanor afterwards how her personality seems to change. All seemed right in the world when Jack and Lily return to their platonic relationship at film's end! Having viewed the director's cut recently I've found my own perspective has changed dramatically with time but I still like this movie for much the same reasons. A lot of the intensity I felt seeing it back then must've been due to my age and feeling one with the character of Jack  something I can sadly no longer do. The fight scenes play out to me rather comically now but back then they were frightening. Its a testament to Scott's direction that this film wasn't too violent for children while really walking the line of what is acceptable.The Lord of Darkness makeup is simply outstanding and has only recently been topped with the likes of Hellboy. Once I was old enough to understand it was in fact an actor in a suit I was blown away to learn its actually Tim Curry underneath all that. There's no shortage of wonder on display here but I think his was just the perfect idealization of evil or Satan EVER put to film.Overall the director's cut leans a little towards the overlong side and while I haven't heard the tangerine dream score in years I'm sure it suits this '80s fantasy better than a stuffy orchestral score. But as Scott says in the commentary it is an operatic film and that is how I see it now almost more like a ballet or a play than a historical fiction like Lord of the Rings. Thank god I was in good hands or I may have been turned off of fantasy forever! This is one to be passed down and I look forward to seeing it light up the eyes of my future children.".

There appears demons  Elfs  Unicorns  fairy  and goblin as Blix played by Alice Playten whose face was designed after that of Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones . As Darkness Ridley Scott was inspired to cast Tim Curry as Darkness after seeing The Rocky Horror Picture Show  he had also considered casting Richard O'Brien as Meg Mucklebones plans to spread eternal night in the land where this tale takes place  by killing every unicorn the sound of the unicorns at play is actually a recording of humpback whales in Earth .This breathtaking film contains imagination  magic  thrills  fantasy  adventure and many other things . This is an incredible fantastic movie which features elves  fairies  dwarfs and other mythical creatures . Ridley Scott drew most of his inspiration for Legend from the 1946 version of Belle and the Beast as well as such Disney animated classics as Snow White  Fantasy and Bambi. Impressive production  the production was filmed on the Pinewood Studio sound stage that had been originally created for The spy who loved me . However  filming was interrupted twice firstly by the studio burning to the ground and secondly by the death of Tom Cruise's father. Composer Jerry Goldsmith's original score was removed by the studio after the first round of test screenings. In an effort to appeal to the kids executives commissioned Tangerine Dream to create a replacement. Until 2002 Goldsmith's original score was heard only with the film's European release. Special mention to brilliant and colorful cinematography by Alex Thomson .Ridley Scott admits that comments made by some potsmoking attendees at a screening got the director secondguessing himself and influenced him to cut the film from 150 minutes to 98. The director's cut reveals an alternative ending where Jack remains in the forest and Lily goes home alone with plans to see him again soon. The motion picture was marvelous and glamorously directed by Ridley Scott  at his best and as stylish as ever  similarly his previous film Someone to watch over me and others as Blade runner Black rain  in which his visual style is impressive as well as his speciality the historical genre  as Robin Hood  Kingdom of heaven  Duelists and Black Hawk down . Rating  Above average . Essential and indispensable watching for Ridley Scott followers".

As Darkness Ridley Scott was inspired to cast Tim Curry as Darkness after seeing The Rocky Horror Picture Show  he had also considered casting Richard O'Brien as Meg Mucklebones plans to spread eternal night in the land where this tale takes place  by killing every unicorn the sound of the unicorns at play is actually a recording of humpback whales in Earth .This breathtaking film contains imagination  magic  thrills  fantasy  adventure and many other things . This is an incredible fantastic movie which features elves  fairies  dwarfs and other mythical creatures . Ridley Scott drew most of his inspiration for Legend from the 1946 version of Belle and the Beast as well as such Disney animated classics as Snow White  Fantasy and Bambi. Impressive production  the production was filmed on the Pinewood Studio sound stage that had been originally created for The spy who loved me . However  filming was interrupted twice firstly by the studio burning to the ground and secondly by the death of Tom Cruise's father. Composer Jerry Goldsmith's original score was removed by the studio after the first round of test screenings. In an effort to appeal to the kids executives commissioned Tangerine Dream to create a replacement. Until 2002 Goldsmith's original score was heard only with the film's European release. Special mention to brilliant and colorful cinematography by Alex Thomson .Ridley Scott admits that comments made by some potsmoking attendees at a screening got the director secondguessing himself and influenced him to cut the film from 150 minutes to 98. The director's cut reveals an alternative ending where Jack remains in the forest and Lily goes home alone with plans to see him again soon. The motion picture was marvelous and glamorously directed by Ridley Scott  at his best and as stylish as ever  similarly his previous film Someone to watch over me and others as Blade runner Black rain  in which his visual style is impressive as well as his speciality the historical genre  as Robin Hood  Kingdom of heaven  Duelists and Black Hawk down . Rating  Above average . Essential and indispensable watching for Ridley Scott followers";

The simple fairytale storyline sees a brave young elf Jack Tom Cruise rescue the beautiful Princess Lily Mia Sara from the vile clutches of Darkness Tim Curry.That's really about it storywise although there's plenty of fun along the way. Some fantastic design gives real life to the forest world where the film is set along with the fire and shadows of Darkness' lair. In his quest Jack meets befriends and occasionally has to outwit elves trolls and sea creatures. It's played pretty lowkey most of the time but it's still good fun.Jack is brought to life well by Tom Cruise. He isn't much of a leading man presence in this picture that would come when he made Top Gun but he still captures the character and fits in well with the movie environment. Mia Sara has the typically thankless role of the damselindistress but she acquits herself well in a good scene where Darkness seduces her. As for Darkness himself not only does he look fantastic but he's played with absolute relish by Tim Curry who savours every moment. Character actors Billy Barty and Robert Picardo have two very good supporting turns.A good movie for a night in. Recommended.".

I have no idea why for Sagan's sake Universal Studios mangled this movie for its transatlantic journey. They chopped nearly 25 minutes. They did unspeakable things to the soundscape and not just by changing the musical score. And tragically they still kept the scene where you can see the Lord of Darkness' horns flopping up and down.The American version is hideous even though I still like to watch it. So if that's the only version you have seen no wonder you don't like it! I suggest you go out and rent the Director's Edition before it's too late!

	schema:reviewBody "Legend is director Ridley Scott's attempt at 80's style fantasy starring Ferris Bueller's Mia Sara as Princess Lili and as her love interest a preTop Gun Tom Cruise as forest dweller Jack. In a convoluted series of events Jack takes Lili to see some sacred unicorns  which he shouldn't for some reason  and then she proceeds to touch one  which she shouldn't for some reason. This turn of events leads minions of the Lord of Darkness Tim Curry in top form to chop off the stallion's horn  an item of coveted power  and kidnap Princess Lili both to be brought before Darkness in a master plan to bring eternal night to the world. Now the 'heroic' Jack aided by his misfit band of elves and dwarfs must rescue the princess and save the world from its inevitable pitchblack doom.The massive problem with this movie and there are copious issues is the fact that it takes so much pleasure in being so damn dark that there's minimal fun to be had  a crucial element of fantasy. Take similar genre films from the time  Labyrinth had the music Willow and Princess Bride had charm and characterisation and the one thing that they all shared was a sense of wonder. Legend is too dark and scary for children yet the plot and pacing is too juvenile for adults.Which leads me to the plot  or lack thereof it would seem. We have some basic thematic elements such as good versus evil and all that crap but it's amazing that with such a simplistic storyline that nothing that is happening on screen is ever really clear instead it seems to rush through the motions of the plot without focus. This is partly due to the fact that these characters are just so damn onedimensional that we as an audience simply don't care.The acting by the leads is really appalling. Mia Sara is just plain terrible with an accent that slips in and out constantly and it's amazing that the fledgling superstar career of Tom Cruise was not affected by this. The major and dare I say only highlight of Legend comes in the form of the Lord of Darkness. Tim Curry is super intimidating as the redskinned demon delivering an awesome performance with a really fantastic makeup job to boot  Darkness is one of the greatest and most iconic villains in cinematic history.I do also need to point out the elf Honeythorn Gump played by David Bennett  I was constantly creeped out by the fact he looks like a tween Anthony Hopkins running around in a loincloth.I understand that this was a troubled production  the sets located on the legendary Pinewood Studios were completely lost in fire and replacement sets were thrown together at the eleventh hour  but it doesn't really excuse this abortion of a film. Although Ridley Scott has made some masterpieces Blade Runner Alien his track record of films such as this make me sceptical of his revered status in the film community.And I am also aware of multiple versions of this movie existing as well. The one that I have viewed does not seem to be the patented Ridley Scott director's cut but a 90 minute offering with a score supplied by composer Jerry Goldsmith  the original European release if I'm not mistaken.The Lord of Darkness alone cannot save this heaping pile of unicorn crap from being one of the lamest and boring films of the genre. Legend  100 ironic title.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this celluloid fairy tale back when I was a kid in theatres. I don't remember liking it much at the time made me uncomfortable and queasy actually and in fact the only thing I really remembered from the film itself was the big red devil. Perhaps I wasn't sophisticated enough then to enjoy it properly so why not see it again as an adult and give it a second shake...My main opinion during and after the screening of the director's cut was that although the decors and the makeup of the creatures are great even by today's standards that the movie dragged mostly in the second half. It felt long and I even yawned a few times. I don't know if it's because the pace is wrong the film lacks action or the story is not engrossing enough but I was bored too often. I also expect some kind of sense of wonder in fantasy films. It happened with the unicorns although unfortunately their horns were wobbly at first breaking the illusion and it did happen with the grand entrance of the devil seen on the cover. It did not happen much other than that. I loved the devil played by Tim Curry in heavy costume and makeup making him unrecognizable. His deep operatic yet comforting voice slightly modified is perfect his expressions are very good and his movements are quite believable. He's the best representation of a traditional devil I've ever seen. Although the main human actors are played earnestly and rather well by Mia Sara and a young Tom Cruise I was mesmerized by the character of Honeythorn Gump the apparent leader of the small fairyfolk. He looks like a child but his big expressive eyes his often severe facial expressions and the way he moves are reminiscent of someone older kind of appropriate for an elf having lived for a long time. The actor playing Gump was 19 years old which would explain some of his performance. I found him fascinating yet somewhat sinister. I didn't find the comicrelief goblins and gnomes particularly appealing or interesting. To be fair they were buried under tons of makeup making them less expressive.I watched the director's cut on DVD and the normal shorter US version afterwards. I will not go in details on the differences here but those interested can check this link  httpwww.figmentfly.comlegenddifferent4c.html . Neither version is perfect but I think I preferred the director's cut in part because of the classical music score instead of Tangerine Dream's new age synthesizer remade soundtrack for North America. The relationship between the princess and Jack Tom Cruise is also more ambiguous my favorite character other than Darkness the elf ? Gump has more screen time the appearance of Darkness is not spoiled right at the beginning making his first real entrance a lot more dramatic and the fun swamp sorceress is there longer. On the other hand with the shorter US theatrical version you are less likely to find your mind wandering or being bored In closing Ridley Scott the director said he was proud of his film despite all its problems main set burning big commercial flop and critically panned at the time being a few and that at least he managed to get that kind of film fantasy fairytale out of his system. Not the most ringing endorsement if you ask me... Scott might be proud but I would not call Legend really good even today. it's passable but it pales in comparison to other fantasy films of the eighties Willow Princess Bride Neverending Story only the first one Labyrinth etc that should be rented or purchased long before Legend. However Legend has several redeeming features pushing it above the lower dregs of that genre. Legend was middleofthepack for that era but suffered from expectations that were too high.Rating  5 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw this celluloid fairy tale back when I was a kid in theatres. I don't remember liking it much at the time made me uncomfortable and queasy actually and in fact the only thing I really remembered from the film itself was the big red devil. Perhaps I wasn't sophisticated enough then to enjoy it properly so why not see it again as an adult and give it a second shake...My main opinion during and after the screening of the director's cut was that although the decors and the makeup of the creatures are great even by today's standards that the movie dragged mostly in the second half.

The only reason my wife and I continued to watch was because of the macabre curiosity that grips anyone watching a disaster and watching this film was about akin to watching a slow train wreck surgery gone wrong Adam and Eve eating the Fruit or the slow plummet of a crippled airliner.  It was that bad.  This film is worse than most which have gained infamy  think of Ice Pirates or Mac and Me but then think of having your nails pulled out while watching them.  It's on that level.  The opening scroll gives you a clue as to just how painful the film will be and it just gets worse when people actually appear on the screen.  Without a doubt this film had a bright future behind it.However for those who loved Plan Nine From Outer Space Mars Attacks! and The Scorpion King this movie might just provide you with a moment of distraction.  For anyone seeking a topnotch fantasy film go rent Conan the Barbarian or Lord of the Rings you could even get a better viewing experience out of Krull DragonSlayer and Dungeons and Dragons.

And the hugely enjoyable chemistry between partners Pacino and John Goodman. They play off each other so well. The dating scenes are particularly fun  personal highlights for me. And of course Ellen Barkin exudes sensuality. Its incredible.The title may sound pulpy and cheap  but its for good cause. We find out in the first few minutes that its the name of the song the killer was playing when the first murder of the film occured.

The story is just great with the legend Al Pacino as Detective Frank Keller who tries to catch and bait a lonely hearts killer. Pacino is helped in his search by Detective Sherman played great by the very funny John Goodman this was one of the better performances from Goodman. Then the search takes a good but yet a bad turn when Pacino Detective Frank Keller finds an interesting friend a very sexy and erotic type looking female played marvelously by the attractive Ellen Barkin. I must say that with the stunning performance Ellen gave with this role she should have gotten any work she wanted to in films. I will not say nothing to any of you who haven't seen the film I will let you enjoy the surprise like I did the first time I saw Sea of Love. Sea of Love doesn't get the respect it deserves still it airs on cable but watch this on a dark and rainy night alone or day for that matter and feel the thrills and suspense of this steaming thriller you would see it's one of the best films around I don't see who would or could dislike this so take a swim in the sea of love!".

	schema:reviewBody "Pacino looks a little beat here. He's not the brooding young kingpin of The Godfather Part II or the idealistic officer of Serpico. But it's perfectly okay because his age and somewhat reduced physical presence fit the role. He's a disillusioned divorced lonely cop who gets bagged up and calls people at three in the morning. He gets involved more or less by accident with Ellen Barkin who may or may not be a serial killer and a nutcase. Barken is well cast too. There's something vaguely predatory about her slitted eyes and lips and there's an animal quality to her first sexual encounter with Pacino. She smooches him up voraciously in his darkened apartment then tears herself away to stalk back and forth in her tiny skirt muttering hoarse ululations before jumping his bones and almost killing him.The support is equally good John Goodman is the soul of cheerful friendly understanding just as he was before revealing his slightly berserk side in Barton Fink. His smile his hand gestures are so practiced and effective. Alas he's required to do one of those stupid male striptease dances like Gene Hackman's in Scarecrow and Michael Ontkean's in Slap Shot. Are they supposed to be entertaining? Amusing? What. I always enjoy Bill Hickey too here as Pacino's father. There was just something about Hickey that made his every performance memorable. Too bad he didn't spend more time on screen during his career. Rooker as the murderer is typecast but gets the job done.The direction is competent but the writing by Richard Price is more than that. It's really pretty good. Not just in the dramatic scenes but in the interpolated comic interludes as well. Pacino is pitching woo to a beautiful woman who apologizes for being older than he is. Pacino's reply Are you kidding? You're twice as good looking as three quarters of the women I know who are half your age.... Did that come out right? What's also admirable about the script is that it focuses about equally on this developing but disturbing romance and the crime plot. Many of the scenes are shot at night and they don't make easy use of New York locations. Pacino and Barkin don't throw themselves into an embrace in front of the fountain at Lincoln Center.Nobody drives across the Brooklyn Bridge. In fact nobody drives so there are no car chases ending in collosal crashes on the FDR which is fine with me. It's still a genre movie not very demanding of the audience but it's quite well done. I'm not fond of Sea of Love the song or any of 50s rock but Pacino and the others would be. There's nothing much else in the way of a score but I must mention the scene in which Pacino takes Barkin to a fancy restaurant to propose to her. The waiter takes forever to bring a menu. Meanwhile Pacino is nervously belting down drinks the payoff comes later and the most hideous strolling violinist in the world keep playing absolutely lousy renditions of Strangers in the Night and something that Bach might have written during a hallucination. Just terrible. My twelveyearold kid would have been more often on key. This guy is lost on the Kreisler Highway. Worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sea Of Love is an enthralling murder mystery which contains an entertaining blend of suspense humour and romance and also some moments of pathos. It's essentially a tale about a search for a serial killer but also it's about a passionate affair involving two people who are both lonely and reluctant to trust each other. Richard Price's screenplay adapted from his own book Ladies Man is sharp and convincing throughout but it's especially strong during the exchanges between the police officers.Police Detective Frank Keller Al Pacino is assigned to investigate a murder in Manhattan in which a man was shot dead whilst lying face down and naked on his bed. At the crime scene the song Sea Of Love is being played on a nearby turntable and the items of evidence found include a cigarette end with lipstick on it a set of fingerprints and a newspaper cutting which includes a lonely hearts advert placed by the deceased. The evidence suggests that the killer was probably an embittered woman who'd replied to the victim's ad.When Keller meets Detective Sherman Touhey John Goodman who's investigating a murder which was carried out in identical circumstances in Queens the two men decide to join forces in their search for what appears to be a serial killer. After a third man is murdered in the same way the two detectives embark on a scheme to identify the culprit. As all three victims had placed rhyming ads the detectives place their own rhyming entry in the personal column and then invite the respondents to a date at a local restaurant. There Keller acts as the guy who'd placed the ad and Touhey acts as a waiter who collects the women's wine glasses and places them in evidence bags so that the fingerprints can be checked against those found at the murder scenes.One of the women who meets Keller is Helen Kruger Ellen Barkin. She very quickly seems to become uncomfortable with him and leaves without having touched her glass.

She gives out contradictory signals can be alternately aggressive and vulnerable and seems to have a low opinion of men although she's obviously powerfully attracted to them.John Goodman is also great as Keller's good natured extrovert partner and his sense of fun illuminates a number of scenes.The deep rooted sense of sadness and loneliness which is a significant feature of the characters played by Pacino and Barkin is also reflected in the melancholic quality of Trevor Jones' superb score the song Sea Of Love and the exceptional shadow laden cinematography by Ronnie Taylor.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sea Of Love is an enthralling murder mystery which contains an entertaining blend of suspense humour and romance and also some moments of pathos. It's essentially a tale about a search for a serial killer but also it's about a passionate affair involving two people who are both lonely and reluctant to trust each other. Richard Price's screenplay adapted from his own book Ladies Man is sharp and convincing throughout but it's especially strong during the exchanges between the police officers.Police Detective Frank Keller Al Pacino is assigned to investigate a murder in Manhattan in which a man was shot dead whilst lying face down and naked on his bed. At the crime scene the song Sea Of Love is being played on a nearby turntable and the items of evidence found include a cigarette end with lipstick on it a set of fingerprints and a newspaper cutting which includes a lonely hearts advert placed by the deceased. The evidence suggests that the killer was probably an embittered woman who'd replied to the victim's ad.When Keller meets Detective Sherman Touhey John Goodman who's investigating a murder which was carried out in identical circumstances in Queens the two men decide to join forces in their search for what appears to be a serial killer. After a third man is murdered in the same way the two detectives embark on a scheme to identify the culprit. As all three victims had placed rhyming ads the detectives place their own rhyming entry in the personal column and then invite the respondents to a date at a local restaurant. There Keller acts as the guy who'd placed the ad and Touhey acts as a waiter who collects the women's wine glasses and places them in evidence bags so that the fingerprints can be checked against those found at the murder scenes.One of the women who meets Keller is Helen Kruger Ellen Barkin. She very quickly seems to become uncomfortable with him and leaves without having touched her glass. A chance meeting with her some time later provides Keller with an opportunity to get her fingerprints but things get more complicated and his priorities change when he becomes infatuated with her and they get involved in a very passionate affair.Al Pacino in one of his best ever screen performances is totally believable as the lonely jaded cop who has completed 20 years in the job and experiences a feeling of dread when the subject of retirement is mentioned as he has nothing in life but his job. His wife left him for one of his colleagues he drinks too much and he's more then a little bitter. Pacino's deportment exudes all these characteristics in spades and it's quite credible that the despair of someone in his circumstances could lead them into a reckless affair with an attractive murder suspect.Ellen Barkin is brilliant as the inscrutable Helen who importantly in the context of the plot shows all the attributes of a femme fatale.

What does the song Sea of Love have anything to do with anything? Why does the killer leave it playing on the victim's turntable instead of taking it with him? Why don't the cops go to record stores to ask who has been buying this same old 45 once a week? Why do the cops continue with their lonely hearts baiting scheme if there aren't any more killings once Pacino meets Barkin? Why did the killer wait so long to attack Pacino when it was obvious he killed the other men immediately after his exwife's first encounter with them? What cop doesn't have photographs of other cops hanging all over the walls in his apartment so that anyone who walks in can tell right off the bat that he's a cop? What man who gets sloppy drunk every night keeps such a neat apartment in the first place? What man considers asking a woman to move in with him when he hasn't even met the woman's child and doesn't even know the kid's name? Why did Barkin's character stay with Pacino's character after she found out what an annoying lush he was? And most importantly what woman would allow her husband to invite a complete stranger to her daughter's wedding at the very last minute and then let them discuss police work? It wasn't a completely bad movie and there were some good parts but overall it left me wondering about too many things.".

By having her as a living on the edge dangerous and private character who like she says Does things on impulse we are frequently suppose to believe it's her. May'be it really is. While Sea Of Love manages to be very entertaining with Al in an interesting comeback of character I like there are much better thrillers out there where as a thriller this wasn't special but the fun of the movie is seeing if Pacino is walking into his own coffin. To make it us throw more suspicion on Barkin' two many coincidences and actions are thrown in a stray gun and throwing Pacino up against a wall for starters etc. The movie though is an old and one of those entertaining watches and Barkin's character if not believable the character itself is one of a kind.".

Although the storyline is somewhat common comparing it to today's thrillers don't let it fool you. This movie is played out PERFECTLY. Sea of Love will keep you on the edge of your seat and has a very unpredictable 'thrownout there' ending. Even though it's still not be my favorite Al Pacino movie to date it's definitely one of the best. It's one of those movies I'm sure I'll watch over  over again throughout the years... I already have... lol I definitely agree with the first reviewer... watch it on a dark rainy night either alone or with a date.".

The chemistry between Pacino and Barkin is great the unease between the two of them only truly broken right at the end of this film. Pacino's performance is really to be admired when you watch it look out for the little gestures and mannerisms.

	schema:headline " Sea of Love is a bumpy ride";
	schema:reviewBody "Sea of Love has been flying under the radar since it's release in 1989 and while it's not entirely fair that this film has pretty much been ignored all these years it's easy to see why this is the case. The film has all the right ingredients for an enthralling thriller but something has gone wrong with the delivery because it doesn't all bode together well enough for this to be considered any more than just above average. The film's main selling point is of course the fact that it stars Al Pacino. Pacino is an actor that will always make films worth watching but it's worth noting that this is one of his 'autopilot' roles that really only requires him to power through every scene rather than actually act. It's a shame that Pacino is on autopilot because it's not every day that you get to see him paired with John Goodman and the two do work well together. If Pacino had managed to really get his teeth into the role like he has in so many other films this pairing could have been something special but instead it manages to merely be amusing.The plot follows Pacino's police detective who discovers that a couple of murders in the neighbourhood are linked by a lonely hearts column and after teaming up with John Goodman's detective from the other side of town the pair put an advert in the same column on the hope of trapping the killer. What Pacino doesn't count on is falling in love with the suspect. The plot is never a problem for this film the problem is the plotting. The first hour is really well done  it's engaging thrilling and even quite funny but towards the middle the plot just dips and it doesn't manage to recapture it's previous form until the climax and by then it's too late to save itself. Anyone whose seen Mike Myers' comedy So I Married an Axe Murderer will recognise the plot instantly but unfortunately this is one of those occasions where the stolen ideas have been put to better use than the original ones. Don't get me wrong though this is still a good film and well worth seeing for fans of crime dramas. It's just massive shame that the writers couldn't write a film that has a plot as consistent as the good ideas that were put into it.".

Trick people steal their identities wealth or children make war drop bombs or annihilate planets and it is all fine. Show two humans have sex for pleasure and millions will revolt. Although few deny that sex is exciting many assert it is not proper or art. Making the audience feel unsettled uncomfortable and flinch is part of the intention here. Written and directed by Japan's Nagisa shima's 1976's In The Realm of Senses Ai No Korida or 'love'slover's bullfight' clinches the title as a risqu and explicit art film conceived to break taboos. Here is a film with full sexuality nudity penetration SM and more whose mission for starters is to push the boundaries promote free speech and deconstruct obscenity. It is pornographic but directed to be the opposite. Given the imagery and subject matter the film could easily be labelled pornography however the presence of respectablemainstreamtraditional cast crew studio and production values  not to mention antipornographic pink eiga film techniques  renders it enough of a something else to confuse most and push the boundary well back. Nagisa shima saw obscenity and censorship as anathema to progress and indeed believed Japan has taken many steps backwards since the days of pleasure quarters open prostitution in brothels openness and individuality. His distaste for what he saw as the society's backward march groupthink and suppression of free speech is the driving force behind the feature. Indeed the old geisha who at one point entertains the main characters of this film when the younger ones ended up refusing to return proclaims that's natural for a woman to constantly have sex with a man. Oshima's statement in this regard sheds light on his intent. The concept of obscenity is tested when we dare to look at something that we desire to see but have forbidden ourselves to look at. When we feel that everything has been revealed obscenity disappears He needed his powers of articulation because  and not for the first time  he would land in court in Japan defending his art. He would live to tell the tale but to this day the film is only seen in Japan cut censored and pixelated. The film unequivocally depicts one Xrated sexual act and thought after another. On a mission to make obscenity disappear one sees complete nudity sex an extramarital affair SM inclusive of pain inflicted with or without foreign objects Kichizo it hurts but feels good exhibitionism ingestion prostitution promiscuityfree sex exposure of children and sex with the elderly. Having scratched items off its list the viewer is still ill prepared for the mutilation that follows. Such is the conviction of the writerdirector and the ensemble around him. The film does not stop there. Caught in its crosshairs are Japan's preWorld War II militarization Japanese traditional respect for one's seniors and tradition male dominance in sex and pornography and crucially man's greater sexual appetite compared to a woman's. Any and all of these concepts would horrify the busybodies that constitute any society anywhere but even more so in the Japan of 1976 with its induced promotion of group harmony and conformity. Based on a real story dating back to 1936 In The Realm Of Senses retells the story of Sada Abe played by newcomer Eiko Matsuda who bedded with her master Kichizo Ishida played by Tatsuya Fuji with their ending up stealing away from their lives in a Tokyo inn in Nakano while abandoning his wife. Scandal ensues when their indulgence intensifies amidst everything described above and more. The lovers completely give of themselves. Coincidentally I had recently watched Akarui Mirai with Tatsuya Fuji who has had an acting career in Japan before and after this feature. It is worth noting this because In The Realm Of Senses features a range of established Japanese talent. Anywhere else in the world and this movie would not have attracted any takers. Apparently many women had come to audition for a cinematic role which involves full penetration. The same could not be said about the male talent. The director recounts many were worried about their phallus size or being able to perform on camera. Nonetheless first there is Oshima's wife the actress Akiko Koyama. She had volunteered to play Sada although some speculate it was done to spur other actresses. She plays a geisha here. The old geisha is Kanae Kobayashi. She plays her actual reallife age. She was an established actress notable for the Zatoichi films. The old vagabond is Taiji Tonoyama whose over 200 credits include the brilliant Ningen No Joken The Human Condition I. The innkeeper is played by established actress Aoi Nakajima herself the daughter of Masayuki Mori known for classics of cinema like Ugetsu or Rashomon. The crew was also an established team working in Kyoto on the set of many a Mizoguchi or Kurosawa film. It is an extraordinarily uninhibited and groundbreaking film. Yet there are beautiful images of oldstyle Japanese rooms and decor traditional outfits melodies of the shamisen and muted but vivid colours throughout the film which is largely restricted to the indoors. The fox kitsune masks of the festival the kites of the Children's festival and the bird dancer mimicking the actual bird of earlier colour the film Japanese further. Nonetheless these are mere interludes amidst the subversive and often difficult viewing. Amazingly Oshima had sought out the reallife Sada Abe Sada meaning 'chaste' in Japanese  although her name and the adjective have different Kanji and obtained her permission to film In The Realm Of Senses. By this time she was ensconced in a Buddhist monastery. Whether one enjoys In The Realm Of Senses or not one has to tip his hat at the courageous and spirited Argos Films the cast crew director producer and Criterion video.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vague spoilersSada and Ishida share a passion for sex. She Sada is the aggressive one possessive and inflammatory. He is relaxed and submissive soaking it all up like an opium addict. Indeed as they gradually spiral into depravity and selfdestruction the whole thing looks not unlike a drug addiction.The film exercises the mind rather than the body  so yes it's art. Is the sex meant to cause arousal? Sada looks sultry during the sex scenes  the pouting lips and dangling hair make it look attractive. Indeed would there be any point in depicting it graphically if was meant to be dull? Nobody likes dry sex. On the other hand neither does it play like a porno movie. The sex is intense rather than intimate and often has disturbing undertones. Various onlookers who witness the couple's performance remain unconcerned at the sight of it. The sex therefore arouses the viewers' senses rather than the libido. This makes it a very sophisticated film indeed.Whether it is immoral is as usual a subjective issue. Many will think so many will not. A more useful debate is whether graphic sex is necessary to the story. Well probably not. Other approaches may be just as effective. However then it would be a different film and you probably wouldn't be here reading this now. Oshima knew that the gruesome fascination of the actual act would keep the film vital and this amount of simulated sex would have been dreary indeed.So then is it successful? Well partly. Once we have grasped that the film is a focused approach to a monomania it is not difficult to become immersed in it. On the other hand sex is essentially a repetitive thing and the film frequently finds itself on the rocks of repetition. But Oshima does not compromise despite that he must know that each new scene is apt to bring forth a slight groan. This is not to say that the director suffered a major lapse of judgment but probably most people would admit that substituting some of these scenes for others that provide more depth to the characters and their lives would have helped the narrative enormously.It does largely hang together. Sada's descent into 'realm of the senses' or the 'bullring of love' as the title may be read in Japanese is depicted with perfect force and clarity. One does not doubt the couple are very much in love. Also Sada's outrageous sexual appetite is genuine in an early enigmatic scene she offers herself to a tramp showing both her sexual 'sympathy' as well as her perverse tastes. The tramp is no match for her however and his own member is cowed into submission. The first hint of her power.When Sada is not having sex with Ishida which is not often she is in bed with a client an old intellectual. Here she learns to connect sex with pain as an extension of her mental torment in missing her lover. Later with Ishida pain becomes an extension and an enhancement of sex itself.Things then start to get bizarre. Sada dips food into her vagina before feeding it to Ishida while a geisha sits close by playing a shamisen. She makes him have sex with an old woman  Ishida cannot resist the challenge  and the conflicting emotions of horror and fascination that play on her face as she looks on is one of the most stunning scenes of the film. Eventually even the geishas begin to scorn the couple's neverending frolicking. This is a warning that all is not well and the couple deal with it characteristically she becomes aggressive he laughs it off. However we are now on a judgemental path. Things become increasingly intense and claustrophobic as the couple gradually experiment deeper and deeper in their ecstasy. Once they have reached the extremity of life they start to flirt with death.Ishida is the more complex character urbanely playing along with Sada's demands while sometimes showing just a hint of doubt and restraint. Passion for him has a tender side he says the old woman reminded him of his mother and he gradually reveals a fatalism that suggests a vague depression. Finally he yields himself completely to the Sada's suffocating passion which leads to his now inevitable destruction.The role of children in the film although slight is perhaps unnecessary and regrettable and the ending is marred by an abrupt stentorian voiceover which gives the impression that the film suddenly considers itself to be a documentary. Overall however this is an intense beautifully made motion picture which craves indulgence and patience but is very rewarding if only out of its sheer uniqueness.For a film which contains 90 fornication there is plenty to think about.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nagisa Oshima has achieved what few other directors have managed in dealing with the very touchy subject of sex in this instance with sexual obsession. If you plan to watch this movie for a cheap sexual thrill you will be most disappointed. Oshima has drawn from a real incident reported in a 1936 Japanese newspaper. The film centers around the love between two people expressed physically graphically into realms of the senses where few dare to tread. And with good reason. This is a very intense film as it progresses from the attraction of two people through increasing experimentation in an effort not only to express their passion but to try to find the outer most limits of passion itself. Oshima must have had something metaphorical in mind but the journey as chronicled in the film also has retained the feel of the specifics. It's quirkey and eccentric. The backdrop of the story is as interesting as the story itself. It is an amazing spectacle to observe giving the viewer a perspective on Japanese life not usually rendered but often alluded to in some historical accounts. One wonders what this experience must have been like for the actors. Oshima has managed what I have always believed should be done in order to treat the subject of sex fully and without shrinking from its' less savory aspects. This is serious minded erotica and quite unlike anything else on screen. The only other film I can recall that compares at all is Taxi Zum Klo which was autobiographical and starred a number of actual people playing themselves.Obviously a different catagory in that regard from what is going on here but both films draw much of their power from explicitly sexual scenes without compromising the integrity of the story being told. This is a film experience that should not be missed.".

It explores the concept of sexual obsession as an expression of love far more fully and interestingly than any American film I've ever seen and certainly is far more interesting than your usual modern Xrated flick.

Corrida uses sex to forward the plot to illustrate the personalities of its protagonists to symbolize everything in their fragile society. Sex is the plot development sex is the key player and sex is the message. The sex takes centre stage.

And yet Corrida and a handful of others are the only films to take advantage.This is why Ai No Corrida is a masterpiece. The acting the direction script etc... are all brilliant. But the ideas and concepts and invention are what makes Corrida one of the most superb films ever made. A film unknown except to those in the Arena.

	schema:headline " Oshima's Gift some spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Nagisa Oshima is one of the greatest if not the greatest talents Japan has ever produced. Disgusted with boundaries and all forms of repression his films find humanity in the most extreme situations and the evocation of the most extreme human emotions the brutality of POW camps in Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence the nihilism of hoodlums in Cruel Story of Youth. His gift the ability to look without judgement has allowed him to be one of the most consistent and interesting voices of the last 40 years. Ai no Corrida is another standout in his highly productive career maybe even the feather in the cap.I'm dissappointed that most reviewers can't look past the sexual content in this film even its advocates. Everyone simply states their opinion on whether or not it is art or pornography as if it were some kind of ideological testing ground an experiment. This is in fact a disservice. Oshima is not interested in pushing buttons. He is not interested in making arguments for or against sex in the cinema. Ai no Corrida is refreshingly liberated from all such considerations it simply is.Based on true events the story follows the relationship of a nobleman and a mentally unstable servant who falls in love with him. The attraction between them is so strange that soon they are inseperable in more ways than one. While other servants look on bringing them food playing music and even sometimes participating the two lie naked in bed having almost constant sex.In the hands of a lesser director this would be disaster but Oshima never sensationalizes the material. This is not to say the film is not explicit it is. It contains perhaps the most explicit sexual images in the history of cinema. However it is all presented with such care and beauty that it makes the viewing of sex and the act itself seem natural.Few films have ever been this intimate. We almost never leave the bedroom. Even as the other servants express disgust or begin to gossip about the couple so entrenched are we in their world that it phases us even less than it does them. The actors perform their own scenes and everything we see is real. Sada and Kichizo's relationship is physical in a way that few people here could ever understand. In the west we associate love and the development of character with words but this has never been the case in Asia. For them it less about arousal than a complete need for the other person. By making their bodies one and achieving mutual pleasure they each achieve ultimate knowledge. Language is an afterthought.In fact I would almost recommend watching Ai no Corida without subtitles. The plain naturalism of the spoken Japanese achieves a kind of unintended camp when put into English text. This aspect is not aided by Argos video's TERRIBLE translation which feels like it was written by a cheap dimestore erotic novelist who has fallen full prey to orientalism. The bare intensity of the performances is spoiled. Words are exaggerated and are in some cases just plain wrong. spoiler Even worse they did not translate the Kanji which is written on Kichizo's body at the end and the way it features prominently into the shot leads me to believe something important has been missed.  end spoiler Until a better translation is available you might be better off knowing Japanese before watching this. I have no doubt that many people's anger over this movie is an unintended biproduct of these misguided efforts.Oshima looks on in compassion as the obsession of this couple begins to grow in strange and potentially dangerous ways. Again contrary to what most people have said about the movie I do not believe it is intended as a morality play. In the west it seems to me that any art which features explicit sex must be seen as a condemnation of that act in order to be accepted. I think Ai no Corrida has something different on its mind. There is a quick but essential scene in which the two discuss their parents Kichizo's mother died when he was very young and Sada was orphaned before she was 3. Here we get a brief glimpse at the pathos beneath their relationship. They are afraid. To let up for even a second is oblivion.To me it seemed as though Sada's final acts were not accidental. I feel there was a mutual acknowledgement of where their relationship was headed and they were both ready for it. These two human beings were already destroyed. They found a brief escape from pain in eachother and enjoyed that escape to its fullest extent with the knowledge that nothing lasts forever. Though there are moments of madness and cruelty during the escalation of their acts the ending seems almost matter of fact. It is not performed in the heat of passion but slowly with an air of regretful inevability underscored by the use of closeups and Minoru Miki's haunting music.Again Oshima's gift the ability to find humanity in the strangest of places. Ai no Corrida is not a film which condemns or exploits. Instead it is a profoundly sad uncathartic evocation of deep loneliness. These two people needed eachother so much that they would rather be consumed by that need than continue normal life in a normal world. Disturbing? Yes but isn't everything?".

That notwithstanding the film is wellacted visually stylish and manages to convey a genuine feeling for the passion which drove the characters. It's also succinct at 96 minutes and has some fabulous sex scenes.As others have commented the reallife case of 'Abe Sada' Abe is the family name was very well known in Japan occurring as it did almost 40 years before Oshima made this film.  There are at least two other cinematic versions of the events.  If anything reality was even a bit stranger than fiction in the reallife case Abe was arrested whilst carrying around the severed member in her kimono sash.  I saw a photograph of her once taken just after her arrest you have never seen a more hauntedlooking woman.The original Japanese title of the film is 'Ai no Corrida'  'Ai' means 'love' but interestingly 'Corrida' is not a Japanese word at all it's a Spanish word meaning 'dash' 'sprint' or 'spurt' and is most often used in the expression 'Corrida de Toros'  i.e. bullfight  strongly alluding to the brutal and inevitable death of the bull at the end.  This puts quite a different complexion on the theme of the film than does the Western distributor's title of 'In the Realm of the Senses' which seems to imply sensual pleasure which has perhaps unintentionally got out of hand.Oshima's stockintrade has always been the 'shocking' film usually made with the aim of confronting 'bourgeois' sensibilities or an accepted view of society or history.  In the 1960's they were more of the sociopolitical variety e.g. 'The Sun's Burial' 'Cruel Story of Youth' but the success of this film firmly added the sexual element to his repertoire you can see this continues even up to the recent film 'Gohatto.'

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was quite a shocker when my friend and I rented it a few years back. It was clear from the first explicit sex scene that this movie was going to be different from the types of movies my friend and I were generally used to. After having viewed it recently again and this time focusing more on the intrinsic value of the film rather than just on the shocking images alone like I had the first time I viewed it I was surprised to find a dark disturbing psychological drama about sexual obsession that really held my interest.  It is interesting to note how the male and female leads who both seem emotionally sterile to the world around them and are barely communicative towards one another in the traditional and normal sense are inseparably bonded by a strange and sexual attraction they have for eachother. It is a fatal attraction of the darkest kind I've ever witnessed in a movie.  This movie is definitely not for all tastes or who are easily offended by graphic scenes of sex. But for those adventurous souls looking for something different and interesting I recommend this film. Nagisa Oshima's other films of interest are Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence and the recent Taboo.".

	schema:reviewBody "This beautifully made film is a searching intelligent and artistic exploration of sexual infatuation and then deep erotic love  but always on the sole plane of sexual union to the increasing exclusion of all other family and human bonds.This is a powerfully erotic movie.  But it's real power is in its exploration of the nature and power of erotic obsession or at least one major side of it.  No unrequited love leading to great sacrifice distant yearning for an ideally beautiful lover ultimately achieved or not or cold sexual manipulation here.  The film's erotic power is despite the fact that neither of the lovers is extraordinarily beautiful although both are quite attractive.  Yes this film is suffused with beautiful images. But it is overwhelming a film about ideas  but not in the remote abstract fashion of some Europics especially of the 70's and 80's variety.  It's a most dramatic and sexually graphic tale.  It can be enjoyed strictly on that level  though I doubt most Americans who aren't college graduate material would much like it.  Those who are and are sexually adventurous are likely to truly love it.  It explores deep sexual intensity as being ultimately about control over and surrender to the subject of desire aka dominance and submission  which first the male and then both and then the female partner lead in dominating.  All is pursued fearlessly and with abandon  yet with ultimately gentile hearts.  There is no violence in this movie and no sadistic or uncaring manipulation. The goal of their mutual control is never anything outside their relationship its always more of their relationship. In this she leads in selfless abandon  and he finds it so seductive he follows.  It's all about mutuality and increasing unification. The one apparent act of violence at the end a shocking one really isn't an act of violence  and only occurs after one of the lovers is accidentally killed by the other.  This is all very unusual stuff on any sustained basis in a movie from any country.Part of what makes this film fascinating is that it is completely outside of JudeoChristian notions of sexual sin limitation and boundary violation. However that doesn't mean it occurs in a society without effective rules on the relations between the sexes and about sexuality.  In many ways there were obviously many more such rules although different ones than the West had at that time  and they governed men as well. The film is set in early 20th century Japan in many ways still a late medieval society in the traditional Japanese country gentry setting in which this film is set though the female lover has a big city bad girl origin.. Certainly there is less sexual equality in exterior social relations than the West knew even by that time not to speak of today.  In the end though this movie shows there was more traditional limitation to male dominance within the family than I for one had expected.  Geishas for example were invited to traditional gentry homes and expected to stroke male egos by privately performing song and dance and generally deferring to men in intimate settings in ways that settled wives actually would not  but were expected to not go beyond flattery and teasing  and certainly not to have intercourse which might e.g. lead to children.  Men could pretend to have concubines and be flattered as though they did but respectable ones weren't expected to consummate the pretense.It is especially interesting that when the protagonist lovers break loose of their tightly rule bound and male dominated society to recklessly follow where erotic control games might lead them with intensifying their mutual erotic pleasure their driving guide they don't end up in an even more male dominated union than the society they came from.  Rather they transcend that world into a radically mutual equal and control swapping culture of two. Its dangerous and it's too consuming but though it starts with her calling him master and devoting herself to his pleasure  which she never abandons  it ends with him doing the same thing.Of course in the universal tradition of such rule breaking romances it has to end tragically.  But the inevitability of this tragedy doesn't seem to be that some socially suppressed devil of instinctual evil gets released from the darkness after the lid of social suppression is worked free.  Rather it's that these reckless lovers traveled to uncharted waters without a map or play book.  And so an exciting game turned out to be far more dangerous and deadly than they really knew.  Not because of inherent evil unleashed  as is the usual JudeoChristian theme in such situations.  But rather because they needed to learn some rules for a new territory  some of which are taught by this movie. SPOILER.Or more prosaically re the tragic ending   yes strangling games may work really well as a super sex Viagra drug for the already high performing  but the moment of peak pleasure in that particular game is truly right at the edge of deadly effect.".

It explores deep sexual intensity as being ultimately about control over and surrender to the subject of desire aka dominance and submission  which first the male and then both and then the female partner lead in dominating.  All is pursued fearlessly and with abandon  yet with ultimately gentile hearts.  There is no violence in this movie and no sadistic or uncaring manipulation. The goal of their mutual control is never anything outside their relationship its always more of their relationship. In this she leads in selfless abandon  and he finds it so seductive he follows.  It's all about mutuality and increasing unification. The one apparent act of violence at the end a shocking one really isn't an act of violence  and only occurs after one of the lovers is accidentally killed by the other.  This is all very unusual stuff on any sustained basis in a movie from any country.Part of what makes this film fascinating is that it is completely outside of JudeoChristian notions of sexual sin limitation and boundary violation. However that doesn't mean it occurs in a society without effective rules on the relations between the sexes and about sexuality.  In many ways there were obviously many more such rules although different ones than the West had at that time  and they governed men as well. The film is set in early 20th century Japan in many ways still a late medieval society in the traditional Japanese country gentry setting in which this film is set though the female lover has a big city bad girl origin.. Certainly there is less sexual equality in exterior social relations than the West knew even by that time not to speak of today.  In the end though this movie shows there was more traditional limitation to male dominance within the family than I for one had expected.  Geishas for example were invited to traditional gentry homes and expected to stroke male egos by privately performing song and dance and generally deferring to men in intimate settings in ways that settled wives actually would not  but were expected to not go beyond flattery and teasing  and certainly not to have intercourse which might e.g. lead to children.  Men could pretend to have concubines and be flattered as though they did but respectable ones weren't expected to consummate the pretense.It is especially interesting that when the protagonist lovers break loose of their tightly rule bound and male dominated society to recklessly follow where erotic control games might lead them with intensifying their mutual erotic pleasure their driving guide they don't end up in an even more male dominated union than the society they came from.  Rather they transcend that world into a radically mutual equal and control swapping culture of two. Its dangerous and it's too consuming but though it starts with her calling him master and devoting herself to his pleasure  which she never abandons  it ends with him doing the same thing.Of course in the universal tradition of such rule breaking romances it has to end tragically.  But the inevitability of this tragedy doesn't seem to be that some socially suppressed devil of instinctual evil gets released from the darkness after the lid of social suppression is worked free.  Rather it's that these reckless lovers traveled to uncharted waters without a map or play book.  And so an exciting game turned out to be far more dangerous and deadly than they really knew.  Not because of inherent evil unleashed  as is the usual JudeoChristian theme in such situations.  But rather because they needed to learn some rules for a new territory  some of which are taught by this movie. SPOILER.Or more prosaically re the tragic ending   yes strangling games may work really well as a super sex Viagra drug for the already high performing  but the moment of peak pleasure in that particular game is truly right at the edge of deadly effect.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Song Remains The Same is essentially a film of a concert yet thanks to the drug and egoaddled personalities of Led Zeppelin in the mid1970s the footage is fleshed out to include weird 'fantasy' sequences involving each of the four band members.  While this section of the movie leaves a little to be desired the concert footage is truly breathtaking capturing the greatest hard rock band in history at their apogee.The film opens with an odd gangsterstyle sequence where faceless mobsters are mowed down by what would appear to be rival gangsters.  Whatever meaning this scene is meant to represent is not clear however it has been suggested that the faceless mobsters are the British press who had vilified Led Zeppelin through their entire career.  Who knows but it certainly makes for an interesting start to the film.From there the film takes an interesting turn.  Each individual band member is introduced.  We see drummer John Bonham ploughing his fields in a tractor bassist John Paul Jones reading nursery rhymes to his children singer Robert Plant playing with his wife and children in an English country lake the scene resembles the cover of Led Zeppelin's 1973 album 'Houses of the Holy' while guitarist Jimmy Page is introduced next to a riverside. They each receive a letter informing them that they are to tour the next day.Once Led Zeppelin take the stage at New York's Madison Square Garden the action really begins.  The band run through some of their absolute classics including 'Whole Lotta Love' 'Stairway to Heaven' 'Heartbreaker' and a massive version of 'Dazed and Confused'.  The quality of musicianship is amazing.  Page's guitar playing belies belief and John Bonham's twenty minute drum solo is awe inspiring.  As the band plays there are more fantasy scenes the best of which includes Robert Plant as some kind of Arthurian hero.  The way in which Led Zeppelin embrace and play on the Tolkienlike world of mystical fantasy is truly refreshing in these overstylised days where musicians are more concerned with the amount of gel in their hair than the music they produce.  Watching the band at work you get a distinct feeling that the musicians of today really aren't as proficient as they were twenty or thirty years ago. Led Zeppelin it seems were better live than on record which would be unheard of today.  As an audience we are able to see The Song Remains The Same for what it is a timepiece.  Post1975 Led Zeppelin's work became gradually lower in quality and as Punk revolutionised the music scene they became dinosaurs at the end of the decade.  But in this time their 19711975 period Led Zeppelin were the biggest band in the world and their power is captured with brilliant clarity on this film.  Whatever happened after this time is a moot point this is how Led Zeppelin should and will be remembered.  A must for any serious music fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Led Zeppelin was the paradigm for rock in the 1970s ushering in a new brand of harder rock that served as a bridge between the first wave of blues influenced british bands in the 60s and the heavy metal that defined the 1980s.  The magic created by the legendary foursome  Page Plant Jones and Bonham  engendered hordes of imitators following their breakup in 1980 and whose music from blues to folk to indian and let's not forget pure rock continues to inspire new generations of musicians.The Song Remains the Same captures the feeling of a real Led Zeppelin concert deep into their American tour of 1973.  That year saw Led Zeppelin at it's most professional to date which despite not containing the same the youthinspired looseness and frenziness of a concert from '69 did nevertheless present Led Zeppelin arguably at it's musical peak with longer more extended versions of songs like Dazed and Confused and Moby Dick.  The concerts were consistently good from that tour and in my opinion their Madison Square Garden appearance here shown in all it's visual glory on the remastered DVD version is no exception.Page is captured in a unremitting show of virtuosity in numbers like Since I've Been Loving You Dazed and Confused and Stairway to Heaven.  This has to be my favorite version of Since I've Been Loving You amongst many others I've heard.  The experience is almost emotionally moving and there is one point where a dazzled young female audience member is shown shaking her head in amazement.  The whole band seems inspired enough to put on an incredible version of Stairway to Heaven including Robert Plant who is not in top form during parts of  this performance relative to usual standards  no doubt attributable to the exhaustion caused by dozens of previous concerts on almost as many days by the last leg of the tour.  The movie still captures Plant's enduring image as a rock icon with his golden mane and long bluejeans enveloping legs that sway with as much energy of a young Elvis Presley thank you Chris Welch for that observation.The DVD transfer itself does not do justice though to the singular official video document ever released of the band in concert aside from documentary compilations.  There are some bad volume fluctuations and other audio problems that are clearly noticeable especially during Dazed and Confused that should have been fixed.  Also despite realistic hopes of hearing the songs remastered for a digital surround sound format Time Warner settled for Dolby Surround Stereo.  This of course is quite disappointing considering the number of other DVD titles encoded in Dolby Digital 5.1 and that one would think a movie in this genre would inherently require the greatest sound technology available.  Also as far as extras are concerned only the original UK film trailer from 1976 are included which dashes any hopes for newly released footage.Still it's a pleasurable experience to witness four of rock's greatest musicians performing some of their most exciting and celebrated pieces while they were at a personal and professional high.   The movie is beautiful presented in a 1.851 ratio widescreen format and watching it on a large screen television is what DVD was made for.  Hammer of the Gods!".

I am obsessed with this movie for the same reason I am obsessed with the music of Zeppelin in general because after giving it time to grow on me and develop a taste for it the movie became addicting to watch. I have now watched it so many times that I have learned to appreciate the purpose of the fantasy clips the placement of the songs on the DVD and why they all tie together the way they do.I do agree with those who believe that skipping the shootout in the beginning is the right thing to do. The country life sequence however provides tremendous insight into each of the band members and completes the picture of the ordinary human side as well as the psychedelic band member side. Robert Plant shares a peaceful moment with his wife and skinnydipping children. John Bonham plows his fields. John Paul Jones reads Jack and the Beanstalk to his children. And finally Jimmy Page sits quietly by a lake and plays a hurdygurdy.Coming into the concert one already has the vision of the four men as normal people in the back of their minds not just eccentric wild rockers so the viewer is not alienated from the band as they launch into their classic tunes with barely time to catch a breath in between. Augmented by the music the viewer dives deeper into the minds of the band members with an emotionally profound vigor. The roller coaster ride extends from the inyourface blues of Since I've Been Loving You to the dark edginess of No Quarter from the whimsical strangeness of The Song Remains The Same to the beautiful stateliness of the Rain Song. Played in a different key the Rain Song has the same amount of power and energy as its counterpart on the Houses of the Holy LP but this live version delivers with a more triumphant confident and splendid statement than the reflective oft melancholy LP take. As the song builds towards its rapturous and victorious for Robert Plant climax the tone of the concert and DVD reaches it height. Then in a stark contrast the viewer then must sadly leave the sojourn in paradise and descend into the uneasy convoluted maze of Dazed and Confused. Just when the viewer seems convinced that his descent has led him to hell as the song reaches the 26 minute mark his reward for his own Zeppelin endurance is despite paradise being lost finding heaven quite literally and being treated to the timeless Stairway to Heaven.The fantasy scenes take the longest to grow on the viewer but with time augment the music and vice versa. It is then that the film begins to resemble Fantasia only with Led Zeppelin music. This is particularly true of the bow solo in the middle of Dazed and Confused because it eerily echos the equally long convoluted and edgy strains of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring but punctuated visually with the youthening of Jimmy Page as opposed to the aging of the early planet Earth.That is the kind of appreciation I have for this movie and although Led Zeppelin is by no means perfect in this movie the viewer can come to respect that because they have that picture of them as ordinary men already in their mind. I believe this movie is overall genius and the most accurate canvas painting of all aspects of the four musical geniuses known as Led Zeppelin we possess.".

We must appreciate that first of all The Song Remains The Same was probably never meant to be a film but a visual of what a Led Zeppelin concert was all about and even more probably meant for their musical fans and others interested in rock music. I've seen this film several times when I was still a young school boy. By then I was already familiar with the Music and the many variations of the main scores which Led Zeppelin were already renowned for.I disagree with your correspondent who judged the band by virtue of this film and stated that Led Zeppelin is the most over rated band. There are many musicians I don't mind calling geniuses such as Mike Oldfield Queen Beatles Pink Floyd etc. But certainly Led Zeppelin deserve to be at the top of the list with songs such as Kashmir Heartbreaker Black Dog Stairway to Heaven Dazed and Confused In the Light Whole Lotta Love Battle of Evermore and my all time favourite Since I've been Loving You.My advice  before seeing the film become familiar with the great songs.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie on the big screen when it was released in Australia back in 1976 and many times thereafter. At that time I was a huge fan but it wasn't until I bought the DVD about 3 years ago that I really had forgotten how good these guys really were. Firstly let me say that I have read many of the other comments by IMDb users and found there to be an interesting mix of likes and dislikes. When judging this film one has to remember that this was made at a time when there was no such technology as there is today. Nor was it intentionally meant for the home theatre market then only someone's pipedream if that! There was no overdubbing later back at the studio. There wasn't 45 cameras focused on every limb of John Bonham's performance of Moby Dick. There weren't big screens beside the stage for the band to see themselves. There wasn't a huge stage production or 76 piece philharmonic orchestra to back them up. This was raw performance and captured on the road as it was. This is a time capsule of 4 great music virtuosos in their own right who when put on a stage together created an electricity that was bigger than the individuals themselves. Who cares if Jimmy dropped a note or 2. What great musician hasn't? For those who want note perfect music buy the original CD's. If you want to experience music from another time and this really is a time capsule this has captured how it was complete with all the psycadelic rock and emotion from that era. Plant was never better in this performance of Stairway To Heaven and this would stand alongside and above many other timeless rock anthems of a later era. Many of today's drummers still hold Bonzo as one of the all time great drummers and marvel at his tempo changes. Today's guitarists are still learning many riffs from both Page and Jonesy. For me the highlight of this movie is the movie itself. To dissect it would only serve to those who want to criticise it in the first place. I was never fortunate enough to see these guys live but played loud on a 5.1 Surround Sound System is as close as you will get to a live concert. Truly a magnificent show and stands alongside my other pride of place DVDLed Zeppelin How The West Was Won.".

But still... This movie is a PERFECT snap shot of the 70's concert scene... Jimmy Page with his cosmic pants and girls with neon blue eye shadow.The movie isn't that great if you're looking at it as a technical piece direction cinematography etc.. But it excels at helping us remember what that period was like. Again a 14 year old Britany fan will NEVER understand it. It's for those of us who were a part of that dynasty. It's Classic Rock Video. You watch it... and remember what it was like in the good old days.I'm still amazed at how these guys were gods in the music industry. Talk about leaving your mark. They defined a generation and changed the lives of millions just as The Beatles did a decade before. This kind of fame will never happen again in corporate America. Do InSync fan's think the same way as we thought about The Beatles and Led Zeppelin? Again this movie wasn't great technically but if you were even remotely a part of this era it's a must see. I gave it a 710 just because I get chills thinking about how these guys were living legends and it seemed like they knew how to handle it.".

Being such a fan myself having at a glance seen these very tracks and more on the cover of The Song Remains the Same I immediately bought the video as my first ever online purchase Next day delivery of course.Indeed the Song Remains the Same is a collection of some of LedZep's finest songs played to perfection by a selection of the greatest rock musicians to walk the earth such as jimmy Page guitar and John Bonham Drums. Both these bohemians of music have ample time and camera exposure to show us just how great they arewere with highlights including 26 minutes of Page on Dazed and Confused including his trademark use of a violin bow on his guitar and a 15 minute solo by Bonham on Moby Dick.What endeared me further to the film was the little excursions from live footage on stage at Madison Square Gardens in New York to clips of the band and crew backstage and even completely random scenes of fantasy and imagery obviously created while under the influence of some fairly way out substances.Yet understandingly those unfamiliar to Led Zeppelin may find this 2 hour video a long slog and is not of course everyone's cup of tea. And while there is impressive stage footage and effects the camera work is sometimes amaturish and unimaginative.Having said that however The Song remains the Same is a genuine must for all Led Zeppelin and true music fans alike as the genius of the performers is clear for all to see and is a breathtaking delight to watch and to listen to.".

The film is a collage of concert material and dream sequences from the 4 band members and Manager Peter Grant. The sequences are hoky and the special effects are laughable. Page's dream sequence is the most mysterious of course. If you read into it something mysterious or mystical happened to him in the womb. If you go to Wikipedia it will tell you more. Plant is a bit androgynous in my eyes. Page is the most undermining in this film unfortunately. He had incredible talent but hit a lot of wrong notes was outoftime tried to play fast with no sense behind it etc. Nonetheless he and the band rocked. The songs and the DVD really drag on. And it's poorly edited. One second John Bonham is playing the drums with his hands the next second he has sticks in his hands. Still I have to watch this every few years or so to get my fill of Zeppelin. The concert is filmed pretty well lots of closeups. The first time you watch this you will definitely enjoy yourself. I think the album is a gem especially No Quarter Dazed and Confused Song Remains the SameRain Song. Really genius stuff from Page and Bonham.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Song Remains The Same seems to get a long of undue praise...mainly from Zeppelin fans who should really know better. True for years decades really it was the only real visual artifact of LZ's incredible twelve year reign but you have to keep in mind that even the band practically disowned the project and regarded it at best as a makework kind of thing after Robert Plant's 1975 car smash that forced them off the road for two years. So The Song Remains The Same was as close to an actual Led Zeppelin concert as people were going to get for the time being.Having said that the film is really more of an approximation of the Led Zeppelin concert experience and for what it's worth in my notsohumble opinion they were the best live band in the business and from a musical standpoint probably the best BAND of all time...I mean the Beatles and Stones are great but you can hardly call them bands in any real sense...look at the Stones Mick and Keith still treat Ron Wood like a sideman even after thirty years!. I say approximation because as with any sort of concert project TSRTS has its share of overdubs and retakes. If you care see the Garden Tapes website to find out exactly what kind of postproduction Jimmy Page carried out on the film and soundtrack album.As for the performance as a bit of a live Zeppelin connoisseur I can honestly say considering TSRTS comes from the end of the '73 tour that it indeed sounds like the end of the tour. They're tired stimulants or not Robert Plant is not in the best of voice hence the overdubs and considering Page was just beginning to dabble in heroin he is a bit sloppy to their credit John Paul Jones and John Bonham however rarely EVER seemed to disappoint onstage. And the songs! For a band that seemed to epitomize the term selfindulgent some of these renditions are very tedious to sit through. I mean c'mon Jimmy...do we really need half an hour of Dazed And Confused? Mind you the '73 tour was not as bad as say the '77 tour where both No Quarter and Moby Dick tended to push the half hour mark most every night! but at the same time the fans couldn't say they weren't getting value for their money. Understand a garden variety Led Zeppelin concert was the exact opposite of The Beatles being on and off the stage in less time than it takes to actually watch the Dazed And Confused performance on TSRTS. Anything less than three hours was practically unheard of until the 'back to basics' 1980 European tour...Zeppelin's last sadly. And the fantasy sequences! I think TSRTS gets a lot of its sardonic chuckles from detractors not because of Zeppelin's stage costumes but because of these sequences all of which are completely unnecessary and for me at least definitely take away from the concert experience. If they had followed Pink Floyd's example and had them playing on a back projector whilst performing the songs that would be one thing but in the film they are just ridiculous...even John Bonham's Gentleman Farmer bit. Though it is mildly amusing to watch Peter Grant and Richard Cole Zeppelin's management acting out their perceived personas at the start of the film...the first time you see it.All told I'd say skip The Song Remains The Same and pick up Zeppelin's 2 DVD set which was clearly the labour of love for Jimmy Page that this film was not. Better performances too. The Song Remains The Same should be considered for diehards only but I'm sure even the die hards know better...".

	schema:reviewBody "I agree with one previous comment that this film could have been so much better. There were in the production of the film evidently good working ideas like illustrating the performances of LZ by fantasy sections representing their personalities in a fashion. Not a bad idea at all but why was it so poorly translated into the film and not very well crafted. Especially the sequences with Jimmy Page look terribly awkward and he was the one with perhaps the most vivid imagination in the band! The scene with Jimmy Page climbing the hill to reach the mystery wizard is pure homevideo quality in lightning scenery effects everything whereas at other time the cinematography is somewhat better and are in better pace with the mood of the music. And the idea that the band members are assembled in one days notice match poorly with the subsequent scene where the band members stumble out of their plane looking as if they toured for 500 days in a row which they almost actually had in reality when this Madison Square Garden performance was shot. Could it be that the moviemakers had to deal with musicians' egos instead of actor's egos? On the plus side is of course the music and a chance to see the touching interaction between Plant and Page the two front figures and exhibitionists of the band with the solid and heavy backup of the more downtoearth Jones and Bonham. Interesting is also to see the feared rock n roll manager in person himself behind the scene Peter Grant dogging everyone around. He is not ACTING my goodness. But he did probably have point in this movie being the most expensive home video ever made.".

I guess it'd be fun if you were completely wasted while watching it but otherwise it's of value only for the musical performances which I will admit have their moments...though even those can be few and far between. I can see why the extended fantasy sequences were thrown inmany of these songs go on for so long and have such long stretches of direction less noodling that watching the musicians on stage would have been thunderously boring. On the other hand watching Robert Plant singlehandedly take over a castle is so absurd that one marvels at the remarkable selfdelusion of the entire band. It speaks volumes about how deeply they bought their own ridiculous mythology that this film was ever allowed to see the light of day...just embarrassing to see grown men prancing about in full lord of the manor costume and a tribute to the appalling lack of taste and good judgment of the whole Zeppelin corporate enterprise.I'm also not sure what we're supposed to make of an extended sequence of Zep's tour manager berating and browbeating Madison Square Garden staff for allowing a bootleg concessionaire into the building...it makes an amusing and chilling foreshadowing of Metallica's latterday battles with Napster which have been equally dunderheaded and pointless.So maybe it's best to talk about the music since that's ostensibly the point here. The performance is a pretty representative display of the 'eavy boys I'll say that. It's kinda sloppy sometimes but that's part of the Zeppelin mash and I'd say it's offset by the moments of inspired improv. The more galling side of it is the remarkable selfindulgence as songs go on for waaaaaay too long and tend to not really go anywhere. Plant is irritating as always and Jones is virtually absent on screen though his musical contributions hold everything together. Page is just silly with his showboatingI give him points for some really creative playing in spots but as often as not he's just throwing a lot of needless notes in there to fill up the sound completely inexpressive. Bonham too has moments but is sloppier than I'd've expected...good to see him having fun back there but this performance doesn't cement his reputation as a drum god.As a time capsule of the pomposity and excess of 70s rock this is perfect and I guess we can thank it for inspiring Spinal Tap but otherwise you can skip it without missing much. If you wanna see a concert movie check Stop Making Sense or The Last Waltz instead. You'll thank me.".

Actually as it was released on Guy Fawke's Night 1976 I was not quite a teenager but you get my drift.At school I got into Elton John before anyone else but the first heavy metal band I sought out was Deep Purple  one of the big three the other being Black Sabbath. At least a couple of kids in my year were into Zeppelin but apart from Whole Lotta Love  the theme music for Top Of The Pops  and of course Stairway To Heaven I hadn't really heard them. I went to see the film with a touch of cynicism. Immediately afterwards I bought the double album on tape. For me the outstanding track is the epic Dazed And Confused Page making wonderful noises with that bow. I was even more impressed later when I got into Al Stewart and realised he'd played on the Love Chronicles album but here he is in his element arrogant and nonchalant in equal measure like a real guitar hero should be.

I offer that just from what I saw in the film I have no idea what Plant is really like so if I sound judgmental so be it. On the other hand Jimmy Page looked like he was working it and having a good time. 'Stairway to Heaven' was my favorite number from the show most likely because I've heard it so many times elsewhere and find the lyrics fascinating.

Several concert staples are mysteriously missing most notably Heartbreaker and one of the better live versions at that and a shortage of songs from the debut. But all of this is nitpicking as the title The Song Remains the Same does not hold true as many songs are extended and improvised on quite liberally especially Dazed and Confused. All the concert bits are great but the dividing thing are the live action sequences witch range from vanity pieces to bizarre acid trips. Overall they don't bother me and are at least competently made but some may feel that they distract from the music.

This might not be right for someone looking for a polished concert movie like say U2's Rattle  Hum or Pink Floyd's Delicate Sound of Thunder.If you are curious as to what a band lookssounds like after its been touring and partying for ages this is it.  Jimmy page is sloppy makes mistakes and goes off key once or twice.  The same goes for the rest of the band except for John Paul Jones who's ever the professional musician. This tired intensity that Zep gives off is unparalleled.  They are ugly in the best sense.Too bad for the 'fantasy' interludes that pepper the movie.  Although many disagree I cringe when I see them Plant dropping to his knees and plunging his sword in the sand Jones riding his horse back home.  During No Quarter for example I suggest you close your eyes and listen to the music. Don't let the visuals ruin the tunes.The band wanted to film another concert for this film after they'd rested a bit but when it was canceled they 'settled' for this one.  Bless them for allowing a concert with so many mistakes to go out.  It is truly interesting to see a great band go on autopilot and still rock. That is the true essence of Led Zeppelin Unpolished and raw just like their albums.  This concert flaunts it.".

There might be spoilers!!!!!Despite being a great Zep fan Actually they are my second favorite band after Pink Floyd the footage doesn't make them justice as far as I am concerned and gets clumsy every now and then. There are too many technical mistakes that even somebody like me with no knowledge on the matter can notice. At one point during Dazed and Confused the camera crosses the screen from left to right covering Jimmy Page.This and some other huge errors makes me wonder how this film got to make the final cut. Other flaws include music sounding that's not actually on screen. The viewers may wonder if this movie was made by a bunch of aficionados as flawed the filming gets from time to time.On the other hand most of the performances are inspired though sadly the silly fantasy sequences sometimes prevent us from seeing the music be played. A few of those scenes are utterly embarrassing like Robert Plant's which I actually skip when I play the movie. Too bad Page's fine solo in No Quarter was edited. In fact there are better versions of the songs in the soundtrack than in the film. If you compare the video versions of some songs to the ones in the cd you can notice the latter were clearly retouched Example of this are Robert's vocals in bits of Rock and Roll and Dazed and Confused. Certainly some of the most enjoyable moments are those that seemingly did not happen in the venue where this was recorded The credits dixit. Example of this is when the band manager Peter Grant and the tour manager Richard Cole are arguing with some guy Probably the house manager over him allowing unauthorized photos of the band to be sold in the hallways of the venue. The credits don't fool me though they claim these scenes didn't occur there. The same can be said of the footage of a longhaired fan being chased by the police inside the Madison Square Garden during Dazed and Confused. Catches our attention the fact that this footage gets abruptly to an end when the hapless guy has finally been grabbed and the cops take him to a room and slam the door just when the camera is about to enter. I don't even want to imagine what the police did to him considering how little aware of human rights these guys are. Sorry guys but this part doesn't seem fictitious.By and large The Song Remains The Same is a mediocre example of what was like to see Led Zeppelin live on their 1973 tour that the band themselves does not consider their best by the way. I like it overall but can't give a too high rating because of the mistakes listed above. Sure the band have more and better gigs taped and filmed and they should have been put out instead of this poor sample. If Led Zeppelin were not one of my favorite bands I had been harsher on my review.710.".

This was a contemporary movie that was very timely with the whole CB radio fad happening and Smoky and The Bandit having just made a killing at the box office. Not to mention Kris Kristofferson was at this point very much a sex symbol from his movie  A Star Is Born having just been released.Director Sam Peckinpah was in town and was picking out extras to sit in the Old Town Plaza near the gazebo in downtown Las Vegas. I was one of the them. The day was torrid hot and Mr. Peckinpah didn't seem to be in the best of moods. With many curse words being thrown around and a few temper tantrums to boot director and cast we extras endured the heat and the anger... to get a shot to be in this movie. Of course I ended up on the cutting room floor minus a crowd scene or two but it was such a thrill for a twelve year old girl.The movie debuted in July of 1978 a year later and by then a lot of the CB radio hype had died down and the movie tanked at the box office. It was later shown on television it seemed every few months in the 1980's almost gaining a cult following.The movie is clearly dated at times over the top macho but it has a good cast some great scenery and if for pop culture only... it's a lot of fun.".

	schema:headline " A Western...but with Trucks";
	schema:reviewBody "CONVOY even after almost 30 years since it was released remains was  it was an iconic American film by an iconic American director.   This moviewhich is not short on American archetypes from Ernest  Bornine's vile redneck sheriff Dirty Lyle to Kris Kristofferson's  independenceloving Rubber Duck to Ali MacGraw's freespirited  Melissa is really an oldfashioned Western but with trucks. LOTS of  trucks.  Like Clint Eastwood's man with no name gunslinger Kristofferson who  steals every scene with his smile and blue eyes is a man whose sense  of honour and justice compels him to act on behalf of the downtrodden  symbolized in this case by a black truck driver named Spider Mike  played by actor Franklyn Ajaye. But instead of guns and pistols at  dawn Kristofferson uses a semi.   But it's not justice he's after for in the world of CONVOY justice  per se doesn't really exist. That's what makes this film so iconic.  If it was about justice this movie would have been a court drama  with the Rubber Duck hiring a lawyer going to court and getting Dirty  Lyle tossed in jail for his arrogance and abuse of power.  Nor is it about mere revenge for throughout the movie Kristofferson's  character never truly reaches the point where he simply wants to hurt  and destroy his nemesis. It's rather about personal honour and how we  as individuals define it.   Spider Mike therefore becomes not so much the victim of racism which  is repeatedly emphasized by the other characters calling him boy but  of a system that has allowed dishonourable people in positions of  power to abuse that power at will. Into this world comes the  legendary Rubber Duck the last of the independents who alone is  willing to strike a blow for the diminished honour of another man  while seeking no reward for himself.  This is the essence of the American Western and why it works so well in  CONVOY. Take away the trucks put on some cowboy boots and a  sixshooter and you have before you any number of Westerns whose sole  premise is that one man with personal integrity and honour can make a  real difference in the corrupt world in which he lives.   The difference in this case is that Kristofferson doesn't just clean  up this one horse town he with the aid of his posse of likeminded  truckers Burt Young does a terrific job as his sidekick Pig Pen  totally demolishes it. And like those great Westerns only then can  Rubber Duck find solace for his spirit which he does without  compromising either his own values or his personal integrity  This is the essence of honour itself and what really makes this movie  work. Even now after almost 30 years one cannot help but stand and  cheer as Rubber Duck and company take on the forces arrayed against  them as the movie reaches its climax. And then stand up cheer again  during the closing dnouement.  CONVOY therefore isn't about America or even about being an  American it IS America the America of myth and folklore that people  even now still believe in and which the great Westerns of old have  done so much to popularize. Because of that and because director Sam  Peckinpah does it with such style and grace this iconic movie by an  iconic director deserves a place on the shelf of every lover of good  solid entertainment".

This moviewhich is not short on American archetypes from Ernest  Bornine's vile redneck sheriff Dirty Lyle to Kris Kristofferson's  independenceloving Rubber Duck to Ali MacGraw's freespirited  Melissa is really an oldfashioned Western but with trucks. LOTS of  trucks.  Like Clint Eastwood's man with no name gunslinger Kristofferson who  steals every scene with his smile and blue eyes is a man whose sense  of honour and justice compels him to act on behalf of the downtrodden  symbolized in this case by a black truck driver named Spider Mike  played by actor Franklyn Ajaye. But instead of guns and pistols at  dawn Kristofferson uses a semi.   But it's not justice he's after for in the world of CONVOY justice  per se doesn't really exist. That's what makes this film so iconic.  If it was about justice this movie would have been a court drama  with the Rubber Duck hiring a lawyer going to court and getting Dirty  Lyle tossed in jail for his arrogance and abuse of power.  Nor is it about mere revenge for throughout the movie Kristofferson's  character never truly reaches the point where he simply wants to hurt  and destroy his nemesis. It's rather about personal honour and how we  as individuals define it.   Spider Mike therefore becomes not so much the victim of racism which  is repeatedly emphasized by the other characters calling him boy but  of a system that has allowed dishonourable people in positions of  power to abuse that power at will. Into this world comes the  legendary Rubber Duck the last of the independents who alone is  willing to strike a blow for the diminished honour of another man  while seeking no reward for himself.  This is the essence of the American Western and why it works so well in  CONVOY. Take away the trucks put on some cowboy boots and a  sixshooter and you have before you any number of Westerns whose sole  premise is that one man with personal integrity and honour can make a  real difference in the corrupt world in which he lives.   The difference in this case is that Kristofferson doesn't just clean  up this one horse town he with the aid of his posse of likeminded  truckers Burt Young does a terrific job as his sidekick Pig Pen  totally demolishes it. And like those great Westerns only then can  Rubber Duck find solace for his spirit which he does without  compromising either his own values or his personal integrity  This is the essence of honour itself and what really makes this movie  work. Even now after almost 30 years one cannot help but stand and  cheer as Rubber Duck and company take on the forces arrayed against  them as the movie reaches its climax. And then stand up cheer again  during the closing dnouement.  CONVOY therefore isn't about America or even about being an  American it IS America the America of myth and folklore that people  even now still believe in and which the great Westerns of old have  done so much to popularize. Because of that and because director Sam  Peckinpah does it with such style and grace this iconic movie by an  iconic director deserves a place on the shelf of every lover of good  solid entertainment";

	schema:reviewBody "The Smokey and the Bandit target audience never knew what hit them when they went to see Convoy. Used to a diet of directtodrivein films they had no conception of what could happen when Hollywood threw big bucks and a competent if distracted director at the genre. What they got was something that movie historians are still trying to classify. A movie based on a CB radio song that morphed into a poetic homage to machinery where trucks are turned into mythological monsters and filmed cruising through the heatradiating desert to a score of classical music.Why Sam Peckinpah elected to take on this project has really never been explained although that decision certainly supports those tales of substance abuse and the final cut is bizarre enough to also fit that explanation. It is an amazing film as it wobbles between selfparody and selfimportance to a degree never seen before and never seen again until Apocalypse Now. I'm not sure how much attention and interest Peckinpah actually showed toward the making of Convoy. It has the disjointed feel of multiple directors or of a Director of Photography filling in many times when Sam was not motivated to make an appearance on the set.Kris Kristofferson is fine as trucker Rubber Duck although Earnest Borgnine pretty much steals the whole thing.But Convoy's real claim to fame is as the film where Ali MacGraw's career spectacularly crashed and burned. She did not just fade away but shattered into a million pieces. MacGraw got into acting in her late twenties but looked young enough to be believable as a collegeage girl in her first two starring roles the excellent Goodbye Columbus and the pathetic but hugely popular Love Story. Her age worked to her advantage as her two characters particularly Goodbye's Brenda came off as poised stylish classy and smart. She picked up a huge following of male viewers who would have bought tickets to anything she was in and she was generally inoffensive to female viewers. She was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar started fashion crazes and made the cover of Time magazine. She also picked up the head of Paramount Studios Robert Evans as a husband dedicated to advancing her acting career. It was a done deal that she would get the lead in Chinatown a role that would fit her rather limited range poised classy stylish. Her only obstacle was managing the transition to middle age in a way that her smitten fans could accept.Unfortunately she dumped Evans for a short marriage 5 years to Steve McQueen. Just how badly her image and career were managed after she left Evans is illustrated by her bad haircut in Convoy. Just glance at the promotional poster and you may be able to hear the sounds of a million bubbles bursting in the minds of her male fans. The idea of Brenda playing a truck stop mama with short curly hair would have made it too painful to even contemplate seeing this movie. Her fan base literally melted away with the start of the film's promotion campaign. They never returned the illusion had died. Ironically had they actually seen her horrible performance in Convoy they might have felt better as the performance is so absurd it achieves a sort of surreal quality. But a couple years later they discovered replacement Jennifer Beals and moved on.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Star Kris Kristofferson tries rather too hard to lend a mythic or largerthanlife air to the proceedings while Ali MacGraw looks and acts weirdly out of place in this trucker fantasy. Most of the good scenes involve Kristofferson's rivalry with badguy cop Ernest Borgnine. There is a rousing bar fight about halfway through the film the consequences of which lead to the formation of the titular convoy of semitrucks.Rarely has the aimlessness and lack of inspiration of the counterculture been on more effective display than in this film. While reaching for some kind of epic outsidermodern outlaw style the film instead reveals the emptiness of its ideals. Unlike Easy Rider which is a flawed film but at least has some real heart this film does not dwell on the void it has revealed nor does it advance our poetic understanding of antiheroes and outlaws. There's very little poetry in a semitruck and the film is too selfserious to indulge in the kind of outright farce that made the films of the late 70s with Burt Reynolds at least watchable.If you want to retain your positive feelings about Sam Peckinpah best to skip this one. It's entertaining enough if you watch it with a six pack and don't try to pay too much attention.".

They'd made it big with the Hollywood Money Machine by now already having explored and maybe exploited illegal drugs and the free floating feeling of youthful rebellion that had been simmering since the early '50s EASY RIDER the country's ongoing cultural and philosophical clash between young and old BILLY JACK and even our changing perceptions of the concepts of war and patriotism THE DEERHUNTER and COMING HOME.Enter Sam Peckinpah one of the wildest of the action read that as pointless violence just for the hell of it filmmakers armed with a fairly big budget the incredibly sexy laid back antiestablishment and intelligent box office draw of Kris Kristophersen and the considerable comedic talents of Ernie Borgnine. The only thing missing in this was the psychotic druggie craziness and inspired insanity of Dennis Hopper. The results of the mix were predictable and inevitable.No script to speak of just the lyrics of a pop song by C. W. McCall about a bunch of POed runaway truckers armed with CB radios and a hatred of the then new 55 MPH national speed limit. Throw in a lot of high speed chases and crashes involving loaded 18 wheelers staged by a director who had a long and distinguished reputation in Hollywood as a loose cannon. The final product was inspired escapist fantasy that was almost guaranteed to produce box office receipts from teenagers from coast to coast.The plot of the film if you can call it that is rather pointless and murky it is simply the story of a brawl at a truck stop that escalated into a pseudo social movement. One character a trucker whose CB handle is Big Nasty inadvertently sums up the entire point of CONVOY when he is asked why he's joined the trucker protest. I'm just here because I like kicking ass! was his reply. And so it is as simple as that... the film is all about free form anarchy and flipping The Bird to the established social and political order staged by a bunch of unconventional rebels who were perceived as tough enough and powerful enough to make their rebellion stick. Despite the fact that the film has no point and doesn't seem to know where it's going it was just what the temper of the times demanded and without a doubt it's just a whole lot of FUN! Trucks and CB radios were a major staple of Hollywood then... along with CONVOY there were other efforts some of them more sophisticated and structured like Burt Reynold's classic of the genre SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT that used essentially the CONVOY formula.Not every movie has a higher calling expressing the producer's vision of some great truth. Some are trashy and cheesy but they still garner a place as cult classics and as one of those guilty pleasures movies that we drag out from time to time just for pure enjoyment. CONVOY is one of them... it offers the pure tho vicarious thrill of seeing a squad car that's chasing you get crushed between two semis. It warms the soul with a vision of the Little Guy successfully fighting back against the system that uses him up and tosses him into the trash heap... even tho in Peckinpah's version of that vision we're not really sure of exactly what it is that the Little Guy is fighting against or why he's fighting.As pure entertainment I have to give CONVOY a Thumbs Up.".

Kris Kristofferson is the unremarkable lead failing to ignite a romance with the unremarkable Ali McGraw and seconding better actors like Burt Young to support. Ernest Borgnine is the best thing about the film as the antagonist sheriff villain. The stunts are cool but the running time is too long and outside of the action it stalls. It doesn't help that the film just isn't very well directed either for example the repeated use of slow motion in the barroom brawl just feels ridiculous.".

What's disappointing is that you expect Peckinpah to elevate anything he works on to something better than average genre film status and he fails to do that. There are moments when you sense his presence ... a slow motion shot of big trucks hightailing it along a sandy back road achieves a certain poetic majesty ... but mostly you get the feeling that he simply didn't care about this film.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a strange duck. One of the only two bona fide commercial hits for one of the most celebrated American directors of his era nevertheless pretty much killed Sam Peckinpah's career. What went wrong?Some blame the basic concept basing an entire movie on a threeyearold AM novelty hit. Like the song it's a rambling tale about truckers ramming roadblocks and talking to each other on citizensband radios. Kris Kristofferson as lead trucker Rubber Duck seems sheepish about the overall point while Ali MacGraw as his love interest looks uncomfortable in a bad haircut.Convoy isn't Shakespeare but for the first 35 minutes it establishes an amiable tone and a colorful cast of supporting players. The jokes are hitandmiss but establish an enjoyable trucker camaraderie. Kristofferson's not much of an actor for me but he's effective here working his gruffbutkindly persona for what it's worth.The early part of the film culminates in a fistfight in a roadstop diner. This sequence is wellshot and edited belying the notion of Sam directing the entire film out of his skull on cocaine. A slowmotion shot of ketchup splattering over one combatant shows Bloody Sam had a sense of humor about his reputation. One cop seems impervious to fists and chairs alike leaving Duck to marvel That ain't no cop that's a mule wearing a uniform. You laugh because it's set up well.But then the film moves to the Rubber Duck and his pals escaping the law and with that ideas run out fast. The movie pushes its points hazy as they are with unbecoming directness. One cop introduces himself My name is Bob Bookman sir and I hate truckers. The Duck goes on some existential tangent about his growing band of followers telling his pal Pig Pen Burt Young Who the hell else they got?Much of the film focuses on Sheriff Dirty Lyle overplayed by an uncommonly intense Ernest Borgnine who chases the Duck because well he's the law and doesn't like backtalk from people he hits up for bribes. The story wanders into amnesty discussions between the Duck and an ambitious governor with assorted points about grandstanding politicans hammered over and over.In an outofnowhere dramatic shift trucker Spider Mike Franklin Ajaye is beaten and stuck in jail in Texas setting the stage for the Duck to break him out. The amiable comedy of the early film still lingers but it's largely overwhelmed by this and other stabs at significance. By the end the Duck has passed from myth to deity in a drawnout finale with a lot of strained laughter. Here's an idea It's a comedy when the audience is left laughing not the actors on screen.Convoy never sinks entirely the visuals are cool and the supporting cast fun company. It just doesn't do enough with what it has. It's here I think Peckinpah failed the film not working the script in a more engaging direction. He leans on stunts in place of story after the fifteenth flipped cop car I started getting old ATeam flashbacks.A lot of familiar faces from other Peckinpah films appear here in both lead and supporting roles. Sam himself appears twice as a boom operator in a camera car chasing the convoy and as a face on the Tshirt of Widow Woman Madge Sinclair that reads Uncle Sam Wants You.Early in the film Widow Woman sums up the spirit of Convoy when someone asks her if she wants to join them in their lawbreaking adventure. Why the hell not? she replies. It's a line that worked when Ben Johnson said it in The Wild Bunch. Here it is not so convincing. Convoy entertains but it never convinces. For a Peckinpah movie that isn't good enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "Honestly what can be said about a film entirely based on a country song? This is the first film by the late great Sam Peckinpah I've seen and I must say despite this apparently being him at his worst I'm intrigued enough to watch more of his works. I guess that's solid proof that he knew what he was doing... even while making this. The film is basically a large group of truckers forming a convoy in support to one of them who is to be arrested. They drive around in a long line of trucks in said support. Odd way to show it in my personal opinion but to each his own. The camera caresses the trucks in many shots much like it does in Woo's film with the guns. Despite my limited knowledge of the culture of trucking and my neutral stance on fast carsI rarely enjoy carchases... The Blues Brothers is the exception that confirms the rule I enjoyed parts of this movie. There's a barfight near the beginning with some slowmotion shots oddly blended in with the realtime footage. I don't know if this is typical to Peckinpah's style. This is largely a guy's movie. There's a camera angle focusing on the female lead's crotch within the first few minutes. The plot is driven by trucks and pretty much everyone seen driving one of said trucks is what is commonly referred to as a man's man or one who's macho. The film is nicely shot some very good cinematography. The plot is to my understanding basically the lyrics of the country song of the same name written into a screenplay with few if any alterations. That makes it quite predictable but it's still fairly enjoyable. The direction is good. The acting is somewhat dim though MacGraw and Kristofferson manage to hold their own. The pacing seemed pretty bad but I'm not into this kind of film so that may be at fault. I recommend this to fans of Peckinpah Kristofferson and possibly MacGraw. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie begins with three truckers driving under the handles of the Rubber Duck Kris Kristofferson Pig Pen Burt Young and Spider Mike Franklin Ajaye minding their own business and cruising down the highway. Suddenly from out of nowhere they get a message that the highway is totally clear and advising them to speed up. Naturally they eagerly follow this advice only to find out that the person on the other end of the CB radio is actually an Arizona sheriff named Lyle Wallace Ernest Borgnine and he has tricked them into violating the speed limit. Not only that but he then proceeds to pocket their money in exchange for letting them go on their way. Needless to say this doesn't make them very happy and when one of the Sheriff's deputies tries to harass Spider Mike at a nearby truck stop things quickly go south from there. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie is based on a song that came out a year or two earlier and helped to further a new American fad involving CB radios and films based on highway truck drivers. Although these films seemed quite new and exciting at the time the luster has essentially vanished from most of these movies and this particular picture is no exception as it now seems rather dull and outdated. Slightly below average.".

Overall it is soulless and heartless with everyone including Sam going through the motions. It lacks excitement and one certainly can't sympathise with the characters good or bad. Indeed I didn't care what happened to them. Compared to the majority of Sam's work this is by far the weakest effort. The themes of loyalty and comradeship trust and betrayal faith and despair etc. are of course an underlying factor as they are in many of Sam's movies but there was no depth of feeling within this thinly plotted story. After all there's not much you can you squeeze from a trucking song! Smokey and the Bandit was better for goodness sake! At least that was funny. Convoy doesn't know whether it is a comedy or a drama or a political statement or just a beardy beerbellied guys' movie. When compared to Sam's earlier masterpieces Wild Bunch Pat Garrett Ride the High Country even Cross of Iron Convoy looks and feels like it was made by some tv hack. I'm sorry Sam wherever you are but 23 years down the road it's still a turkey.".

	schema:reviewBody "I heard the theme song on the radio back in late 77' I think it was. Almost Erie kind of riding on the wind type of sound off in the distance building up speed and strength. The movie finally hit the theaters and my parents would not let me see it though. So I waited and waited and tried to see it with no luck until it came to television. From the first scene in the desert it looked like snow then seemed to turn hotter the sand becoming the desert overtaking the roadway blowing along in the wind. Kristopherson was quite the believable long hall trucker. A rebel and a sort of 'Loner' with a lot of friends mainly others that looked at him as if he was a hero to them. Their 'idol' so to speak. It seemed to get moving quickly and then slow at times where it needed to tell the story and balance things out. The critics however hated this one! They lambasted Director Sam Pekinpah for making this as if it was only a 'silly' theatrical charade. What the hell is wrong with these 'critics'? The soundtrack as far as I could remember had everyone singing it I don't think the movie did mammoth numbers at the Box office but I believe it pulled in enough to cover the production costs etc. This probably did even better over seas. I thought that the characters in this and the story which I liked even though some others along with those wonderful 'critics' didn't appreciate the simplistic beauty of it they thought it too 'thin'. Oh well now this movie is damaged goods right? Not quite. From the evil Lyle 'the Devil'Wallace sheriff Ernest Borg. to his 'comrads in arms' so to speak the entire rest of the trucking industry practically everyone delivered what the character brought to the script. Even if that didn't work out well...you still had all the big iron monsters of the highway to watch in all their glory. You have to admit it was the perfect time for a movie like that with semi trucks you sure couldn't make it work today in our current climate of life and electronic and digital gadget's. Even down to the camera work this was shot in 'cinema scope'style I think that they industry still uses that term. Anyhow it pounds through and through with tension at times right on down the line to the little twist in the ending small but just right for this Pekinpah feature. Even the Sheriff after thinking he had donein 'The Duck' had a latent taste of his own humanity and laughed and laughed in release of his anger at Pennwald the lead trucker most likely burying the hatchet in his mind.This was 70's no disco at a time when many different programs and movies seemed to be centered around the 'Disco' era this was not even close. I enjoy watching this now at least once or twice a year. I found it on DVD. Enjoy it if you can find it. ".

After a fight breaks out between the truckers and the police started by Wallace's bullying tactics the truckers flee towards New Mexico. What starts out as a few trucks turns into a giant convoy and soon the chase becomes a media event and a political tool for votes.Based on the country song of same title by C.W. McCall and directed by Sam Peckinpah Convoy became surprisingly to most in the industry a hugely popular film. Containing no plot of any substance it does however have an enormous sense of fun and features some nice Peckinpah flourishes. Huge trucks tearing across the landscape surprisingly makes for easy on the eye cinema dust tracks framed in poetic style slow motion car crashes and erm chickens falling from a coop in fact lots of crash bang and wallop to entertain. Outside of that what heart there is in the piece is to be found in the free spirited nature of our truckers especially Rubber Duck who becomes something of a hero to anyone who uses the road. Kris Kristofferson plays Rubber Duck and it's a great bit of casting Ernest Borgnine suitably steps into Sheriff Wallace's big trousers and Burt Young is dead on entertaining as Pig Pen. Sadly this is yet another film that proves Ali MacGraw just couldn't act tho in her defence here the character Melissa is poor and totally pointless.Convoy is the sort of film that i personally understand if folk hate it and think it has no merits whatsoever but much like Smokey And The Bandit from the previous year vehicles going fast and creating mayhem makes for a whole lot of fun to be taken with a pinch of cheek. 710".

	schema:headline " Comedic action film has plenty to recommend it however the juggling of two many styles makes it less than the sum of its parts";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of the Seven Masters who recruit a bumbling police officer into their group in order when its discovered that he possesses a high level of Chi. The timing is very fortuitous since an ancient enemy has awoken and is once more spreading evil in the world.I first read about this movie when several online reviews said that this was destined to be the next big thing in movies. Later reviews were positive but were less glowing noting that the film has several parts that don't fully mix together. I'm in the camp with the later reviews since I find the mixture of styles works against the parts.I should begin with the action. If you want to see great action this is the movie for you. Hand to hand and weapons such as swords are used through out the film to great effect. Sure its done with wires and computers but it doesn't matter since its so much fun to look at. Very often you watch the madness on screen and go OH Cool even though you know how its done. I loved when our hero throws a cup at the villain who catches it on the flat end of his sword and then sends it spinning back with even more force. Amazing.You really should try this film for the action if nothing else. The humor in this film is both knowing and very funny. The opening roundtable of the masters discussing the difficulty of training is priceless especially if you've seen any martial arts movies. There is a nice friendly edge to it that is mostly right on target. The problem is that our hero is often much to bumbling to be believed especially after he's been in the training program for a while. The too slapsticky attitude is what really hurts the movie since there is no natural progression just silliness for silliness sake The ending for example.The cast and the characters are great. These are people you can really root for. The villain is also suitably evil.If you were to take all of the movies parts and look at them separately you'd be amazed at how good they all are. The problem is that when you put the bits together the film doesn't quite work together. As I said the slapstick doesn't hold up all the way through. The film is overly jokey at times even in serious moments. Its hard to keep a light edge when characters are spewing blood and being run through with swords. It takes a bit of the love for the film away and leaves you with admire and simply like. The film also suffers from a pacing problem with slow period in the middle with the training bookended by a funny beginning and an action packed end.Still I think you should give the movie a shot especially if you like action movies especially when they have a humorous side to them. In all probability you're going to be like me and like this movie but you won't love it.".

It's set in a moderntime period but takes martial arts and special effects to a whole new level with characters running down the side of buildings jumping great distances and even having this power called jangpung which is blasting objects out of the way. Normally I would have called this cheesy but the director and writers actually made it funny. Now the main character isn't a typical superhero. He's a deadbeat cop with no selfesteem whatsoever. You follow him as he's recruited by the Seven Masters and trained into shape. He falls in love with one of the Seven Masters EuiJun. An evil spirit takes human form and looks for this legendary sword. It's your typical Asian action movie but it's also extremely funny and fastpaced.

	schema:reviewBody "As Eastern cinema grows more and more popular in the West largely thanks to its being aped by such filmmakers as the Wachowskis and Quentin Tarantino an increasing number of cinematic gems from across Eastern Asia are now arriving in the West. While films like Hero and House of Flying Daggers gain widespread theatrical releases the more common place to find some of these films is on DVD and that's precisely where I found Arahan.Having never heard of it before I was struck by the synopsis on the back of the box that likened it to Stephen Chow's he of Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer fame manic output I took a chance on it and was mildly surprised by what I saw.Directed with confidence and occasional flare by Ryu SeungWan Arahan tells the story of Sang played Ryu SeungBum who you may recognise from Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance a somewhat goofy and ineffective cop who no one can seem to take seriously. After a disastrous attempt to ticket the local congressman's chauffeur for running a red light Sang spies a pursesnatcher and promptly gives chase. Unknown to him the pursesnatcher is also being pursued by EuiJin played by Yun Soy a Tao master in training. When Sang is struck by her errant palm blast he finds himself in the care of the Seven Masters oddly enough there are only five of them. Harbouring a crush on EuiJin and a strong desire to kick some ass Sang begins training under the Masters in the hopes of Maruchi or enlightened male master.One thing Arahan is not is slow. It moves at a brisk clip while at the same time managing to feel unhurried in reaching it's destination. It also boasts some fun characters. SeungBum is delightful to watch as Sang. The unusual combination of barrel bottom self esteem stubborn pride and impatience is interesting to watch and SeungBum manages to carry it off wonderfully without ever letting the character descend into a mess of neuroses which could have so easily happened. Yun Soy makes a suitable foil and displays a lot of fire in her performance but her delivery sometimes falls a little flat. Admittedly she has less to work with as the slightly clichd girl with great power and responsibility who just wants to lead a normal life has been a fairly common theme in recent years but all in all she acquits herself well. Jeong DooHong is also well cast as the movies icy villain HeukUn a former Tao Master with a neat line in martial arts moves and a PhD in not knowing when to call it quits.In terms of action for Arahan is a Kung Fu movie so not to mention it would defeat a lot of the object in a review of the film Arahan manages to pull out some neat scenes using the full gamut of tricks currently employed in the genre including extensive wire work in some of the later battles occasional use of CG and a nice mixture of sword and fist fights to lend the scenes some variety. It never truly raises the bar and on occasion the fights can be heavily edited perhaps to cover some of the performers lack of skill. By and large though it gets the blood pumping and will make you wince at just the right moments all the ingredients of some decent Kung Fu.Unfortunately Arahan does have one fairly large flaw. While billed as a comedy Arahan can be surprisingly uneven in its tone. Much of the films humour tends to be slapstick although there are some knowing asides to Kung Fu genre in general particularly at the very beginning. The result of this somewhat broad humour combined with the manic performances will bring smiles to all but the most jaded. The downside to this however is when the film wants to get serious it pulls some nasty sucker punches that deaden the otherwise light and bouncy mood so suddenly you'll wonder if you're still watching the same film. Sang's ego destroying beating at the hands of a gang of thugs and any scene where HeukUn turns up are good examples of this and it's only toward the movies end that the two distinct tones of the movie begin to mesh any where close to successfully. It's a bit of a shame really. While the humour is welcome and largely on the nose if a little broad at times had it been reigned in slightly perhaps been made a little more subtle the films jarring changes of mood would have been less noticeable and the film itself doubtless would have been stronger for it.In the end Arahan overcomes its flaws to provide a largely entertaining and irreverent slice of Kung Fu with a sideline in unexpected brutality. It may not be able to go head to head with best of Chow's output but that it can be mentioned in the same sentence is more than praise enough.".

So that's how bad my knowledge and devotion is. It was surprising therefore to discover that Arahan is actually a very funny and very exciting movie that zips along loud fast and funny.SangHwan is a lowly beat cop. He's clumsy accident prone and bumbles more than the average bee. He doesn't believe he has any special powers but when he makes friends with a group of five old masters they recognise his potential and recruits him to help preserve the balance of the world from evil...or something. Which is great timing because an ancient bad guy has come out of a long long hibernation to seek the key to the ultimate nirvana and spread order over the whole world...or something.Yes it's gobbledygook. In fact it's alarmingly similar to Bulletproof Monk only not total crap. There are loads of laughs to be had. Arahan has a great sense of comic timing and the ability to jump from silly gags to serious action in just a few seconds.When it comes to plain old handsandfeet fighting Hollywood movies seem to be lacking of late. It's all CGI and spandex. Eye candy it may be but it's good to see something filled with practical fighting effects despite the final showdown going on a bit.The one bad thing that costs it half a star is the nasty Eighties synthesised score. Doesn't Korea have anything better than those shoddy Yamaha keyboards that I used in music class in high school? Hell I could do better myself.You can criticise the film for being mindless  hey just because it's subtitled doesn't mean it's artsy fartsy  but for two hours of fun Arahan will do nicely.".

Hell I could do better myself.You can criticise the film for being mindless  hey just because it's subtitled doesn't mean it's artsy fartsy  but for two hours of fun Arahan will do nicely.";

Ambitious.If I could one major fault with 'Arahan' it is that the movie takes itself too seriously at times. On the other hand 'Volcano High' despite being presented in a serious way was nonstop fun. 'Arahan' sometimes drags on giving away few laughs but then makes up for it with scenes of awesomeness.Complaints aside it was generally a funny movie with some nice visual effects and some pretty cool fantasy fight scenes.

Sanghwan begins his training however he soon gets frustrated with his lack of progress. Soon after he starts training the villainous Heukwoon is accidentally freed from his underground prison he is more powerful than the Tao masters and intends to become more powerful by taking a key from them which could enable him to control the world. Ultimately it will be up to Sanghwan and Wijin to stop him.This Korean film is a lot of fun if you like special effects enhanced martial arts with a good dose of comedy. The story is solid and easy to follow and the characters are fun. The more humorous parts of the film are mostly in the first half as Sanghwan attempts to train and the masters try to find more people who are interested in their ancient skills. As we move into the second half the action increases and there are some great set pieces most notably when Sanghwan is confronted by local gangsters in a restaurant and the ultimate fight against Heukwoon. While these fights are obviously somewhat exaggerated they feel real within the context of a film where such powers exist. The cast does a solid job Seungbum Ryoo and Soyi Yoon work well together as Sanghwan and Wijin and Doohong Jung is suitably menacing as Heukwoon. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to martial arts fans especially if you like those with exaggerated skills and a touch of humour.These comments are based on watching the film in Korean with English subtitles.".

Watching it for myself I found a film that has good bits and will appeal to martial arts fans but somehow doesn't really come together. The problem is in the delivery of the story and to a point where the story actually goes. At times it appears that this is a Jackie Chan style action comedy with plenty of bumbling laughs mixed with the action.

Now as a fan of cocktails and smoothies I can get with the idea that things that don't naturally sit together can work great in the right mix  but it has to be the right mix. With Arahan the mix is never right and it feels fractured as if sections of the film were made by different people with different ideas of what the film is all about.As far as individual parts go there is nothing specifically wrong with anything on its own even if I personally found the more weighty material to be far too silly to support that tone. This is contributed to by the mix of tones though because it is hard to take the film too seriously when it has characters running vertically down tower blocks and the like. It is a shame because the tone affects the characters and they are uneven as well but the main impact is how much you are able to really enjoy the film. So you're into the light fun but then suddenly people are dying bloody deaths. Then you get into the seriousness of the mysticism but just as you do then it changes it up again without much connection. The cast do their best with it but most of them are best with the lighter touch and action. Ryu is a likable lead who can do geeky as well as he does muscledarrogance later on. Yoon works well with him and she is both pretty and cool making for another likable lead. The older masters are best when they are allowed to work with the modern twist on their characters but are not so good when the plot makes them get serious and worthy.Overall Arahan is an OK film that has plenty of specific good bits in the comedy and the action sequences  certainly genre fans will like what they find. It is a real shame that the uneven tone breaks it up so much and prevents it really getting a constant flow that the viewer can get into.".

It is always fun to see someone train and watch someone get stronger and more skilled. Personally I can't get enough of these kind of stories. Especially when they are fun and provide a lot of eye candy. Even when this movie is meant to make you laugh it can be very serious at times. The balance between laughter and drama is great.

	schema:reviewBody "While not one of Hitchcock's most wellknown films Secret Agent is one of his most creative.  His version of the world of espionage is quite different from and much richer than the usual James Bondtype spy story.  This movie is also distinguished by large doses of good humor and by some creative uses of the story's setting in Switzerland.John Gielgud plays Ashenden an English spy in World War I.  He is assigned to go to Switzerland determine the identity of an important German agent and then stop the enemy agent before he can carry out his mission.  Gielgud has two assistants a young agent posing as his wife Madeleine Carroll and an eccentric assassin Peter Lorre.  What makes the film interesting is that Gielgud's character is not at all the stereotyped dashing movie spy and he has a keen sense of the human cost involved in what he is doing.  By contrast his two assistants are both excited about the mission and look forward to the game of tracking down and eliminating their quarry.  As the story proceeds it is the reluctant but responsible Ashenden who persists in continuing the mission in spite of some bad surprises while the once enthusiastic Mrs. Ashenden quickly begins to lose heart when she realizes what espionage is really all about.  At the same time the twists and turns of the mission itself lead to some interesting and tense developments.  This is all handled with Hitchcock's usual mastery of suspense and irony.Hitchcock also makes full use of the setting and typical Swiss themes like mountain climbing chocolate and folk dancing are all part of the plot. Hitchcock makes use of these elements in a natural way not forcing them into the plot and the whole production is nicely crafted.  There are some excellent scenes including a scene in an old country church that combines humor and suspense and a chase through a chocolate factory.Because its hero has a reluctance about his mission that we do not expect in our spy heroes Secret Agent has never been one of Hitchcock's most popular films.  And the story does have some odd aspects to it.  But this is quite a good film worthy of attention and one that shows many aspects of the great director's skill and imagination.".

	onyx:emotionText "While not one of Hitchcock's most wellknown films Secret Agent is one of his most creative.  His version of the world of espionage is quite different from and much richer than the usual James Bondtype spy story.  This movie is also distinguished by large doses of good humor and by some creative uses of the story's setting in Switzerland.John Gielgud plays Ashenden an English spy in World War I.  He is assigned to go to Switzerland determine the identity of an important German agent and then stop the enemy agent before he can carry out his mission.  Gielgud has two assistants a young agent posing as his wife Madeleine Carroll and an eccentric assassin Peter Lorre.  What makes the film interesting is that Gielgud's character is not at all the stereotyped dashing movie spy and he has a keen sense of the human cost involved in what he is doing.  By contrast his two assistants are both excited about the mission and look forward to the game of tracking down and eliminating their quarry.

The discordant sound of the organ for example stands out. It isn't pretty and why should it be? The organist's dead after all. The noise in the chocolate factory is a continuous din relieved only by a fire alarm! Then two of the main characters are caught in the belltower of a church when the bells begin to ring. Again the sound isn't pleasant at all but quite annoying. A musical scene with yodelers ends up with coins being swirled around plates and is almost overbearing. The dog's howling in its psychic moment is long and unnerving. In all these sound effects set the audience on edge which I think was part of the original plan. The two central characters are uneasy with their task and we are made to suffer too. This is an unusual film for Hitch and well worth the time.Curtis Stotlar".

	schema:reviewBody "A young British army officer is 'killed off' on the Western Front so that he can assume a false identity and go to Switzerland on a secret mission.  Brody or Ashenden as he is now known finds the dirty business of espionage distasteful but is determined to see his mission through to a successful conclusion.In this early Hitchcock thriller John Gielgud plays Ashenden as a cheerless snob.  His acting is wooden and unappealing and his embraces with Elsa Madeleine Carrollare cold and unconvincing.  Peter Lorre is an overthetop delight as 'the General' the exotic and nasty little assassin. His toiletpaper tantrum is great fun and he moves the plot along with superb little nuances of gesture as when he follows the progress of the chocolatebox note.There are some striking Hitchcockian moments.  Is that the Master himself coming down the ship's gangway ahead of Ashenden?  The dead organist is 'playing' a constant discord alone in the Langenkirche because his lifeless head is slumped on the organ keys.  In a classic piece of tensionbuilding Hitchcock makes the organ sound swell dramatically as Ashenden and the General unsuspecting approach the body.  Of course the corpse shouldn't be able to increase the organ's volume.  That doesn't matter.  The effect is great.The scene shifts from London in an air raid to the Swiss Alps and as a postscript to the BulgarianGreek border.  The main locations are attractively depicted London's sky a lattice of searchlights and Switzerland a mountain idyll.Hitchcock plays clever tricks with the button found in the dead man's hand.  It sets our heroes off in pursuit of Caypor and then it comes back to haunt Elsa's conscience.  When the folk singers swirl coins in bowls Elsa can see only the infernal button.  It does not bother the viewer that the coincidences surrounding the button are farfetched because the pace and confidence of the storytelling suppresses any incipient scepticism.The incident on the Langen Alp is in many ways the film's climax with Hitchcock's trademark suspensebuilding very much to the fore.  As the muchdreaded moment draws near the cuts to the polite German conversation class raise the viewer's anxiety to an unbearable pitch.  Caypor's frantic dog is a masterly touch the women and the pet know intuitively that the worst has happened.  Soon afterwards Elsa sits silent in her misery between Ashenden and the General who both chat blithely across her.  The camera closes in on her explaining her feelings of guilt better than any dialogue could.Throughout his long career Hitchcock pursued a specific ideal of feminine beauty.  Kim Novak and Tippi Hedren were its 1960's manifestation and here in 1936 Madeleine Carroll is the freshfaced girl with the fine bone structure and the blonde bob.The arbitrary deaths in the final reel are silly and the crash of the model train even sillier but by this stage the director has eschewed exposition and is hurrying to tie up the plot's loose ends.  Even if the viewer thinks hard he is at a loss to explain what Ashenden was ever doing in Switzerland in the first place but the trick is not to think too hard.".

With these principal players it should be no surprise that the performances are topnotch. However given the fact that Lorre was at the time at one of the lowest points in his tumultuous but brilliant career it is possible that his overthetop and uncharacteristically comedic performance at least began unintentionally and was exploited by the great director as a lastditch effort to complete the film successfully. The story is based rather loosely on a Somerset Maugham story translated for theater by Campbell Dixon then adapted by Hitchcock favorite Charles Bennett. Quite a bit as you can well imagine changes as a result of the translations from medium to medium.The drama turns on a developing romance between Gielgud and Carroll's characters  and the burgeoning consciences which accompany it. Will they be able to carry out their patriotic duty if and when they finally track down their opponent or will they fail? Furthermore what will the zealous and perhaps a little psychotic General do if his coconspirators drop out of the spy business at the last instant? Typical Hitchcock plot devices i.e. trains quirky romantic relationships European ethnic stereotypes make cameo appearances at appropriate points in the story and enhance the experience for Hitchcock aficionados.The script and general storyline is not one of the best Hitchcock would have access to throughout his career but it is quite rich compared to some of the plots he worked with earlier in his career and the director develops the comedy suspense and human drama economically and affectively if not fully. The camerawork is of course good but not nearly as experimental or interesting as many of Hitchcock's earlier and later films. This is generally true of most of Hitchcock's excellent efforts for Gaumont British Pictures of America during the 1930s I.e. Sabotage 39 Steps etc  very British films made with AmericanBritish casts and production for an international audience.Though less suspenseful than many of Hitchcock's contemporaneous efforts Secret Agent remains a good and entertaining example of Hitchcock in the 1930s.".

Alfred Hitchcock.Like the other spy movies he did Take Torn Curtain and Topaz for instance two of his later works. How much later? Nearly 40 years later Secret Agent is a spy movie without lots of explosions or car chases or shootouts. Instead it is about a man who goes undercover to break up a potentially disastrous international agenda of some kind and along the way falls in love with his partner and realizes that he's not up to the task of murdering someone. This 1936 movie is another in Hitchcock's decadelong run of British talkies highlycontrasted black and white under 90 minutes generally and devoid of major stars except for Peter Lorre who appears in this movie two years after he did The Man Who Knew Too Much.But unlike many of the movies surrounding it Young and Innocent The 39 Steps this one isn't quite as good. Not that Secret Agent is a bad movie far from itThe directing is fine and the churchmurder scene is a beautiful mix of sound and picture. Lorre is much like the male version of Bette Davis  overacting and proud of it. His role as the womanizing yet clever General is much lighter than his usual horrorlaced stuff and he still pulls it off with ease. The leads are equally good. And the humor laced throughout is genuinely funny. Note that even in 1936 it is obvious that Hitchcock was already looking for the actress that would be fulfilled in Grace Kelly  the strong feisty beautiful blonde leading lady.But there's nothing here to just make the jaw drop and the eyes widen. It is a good movie and from a director that has had whole decades worth of great movies it just seems subpar. A previous commentor was right This was the movie for Hitchcock to remake in the 1950s with color and Cary Grant and Grace Kelly  heck maybe even a minor role for Jimmy Stewart not The Man Who Knew Too Much which was one of his best British films.Overall it is good and worth the watch  especially for Hitchcock fans but it's just not quite there. 710".

'Secret Agent' is one of two films he released in 1936 the other being the surprisingly suspenseful 'Sabotage' and it is a worthy effort.John Gielgud plays Edgar Brodie a young British army officer whose faked death is orchestrated in order to assume a new identity as Richard Ashenden to aid in the assassination of a German spy. Madeleine Carroll is the young woman masquerading as Mrs. Ashenden and she is very enthusiastic about her task and dying to see some action. Peter Lorre a favourite actor of mine plays a fellow British spy known affectionately as The General who is playful and ardent womanizer but at the same time a cold and ruthless killer when his job calls for it.The acting performances are generally very good. Some have criticised Lorre for overplaying his role but I enjoyed his reckless enthusiasm a side of his character which contrasts starkly with the side he would later reveal.The beginnings of the genius of director Alfred Hitchcock shine through in several parts of the film most notably the scene involving a hike up the mountain with a suspected German spy and the howling of the doomed man's dog.

	schema:headline " Decent Hitchcock Movie With a Confusion in Early Titles";
	schema:reviewBody "SECRET AGENT is notable for being the only Hitchcock film with John Guilgud in it  and a young dapper looking Guilgud at that. But most people recall it rather for the second and regrettably last appearance of Peter Lorre under Hitch's direction. It is also the only film by Hitch with Robert Young and Lili Palmer in it and the second with Madeleine Carroll in it.Those cast notes being noted let us now look at a confusion of titles in Hitch's movies of the 1930s.THE THIRTYNINE STEPS is okay  John Buchan's novel one of several with Richard Hannay as the hero  another is PRESTER JOHN has a similar plot to the movie. But SABOTAGE is based on a Joseph Conrad novel THE SECRET AGENT. SECRET AGENT is based on W. Somerset Maugham's novel somewhat based on his experiences as a spy in World War I entitled ASHENDEN THE SECRET AGENT. Maugham would use the character of Ashenden in some of his later fiction as a peace time writer. YOUNG AND INNOCENT is based on A SHILLING FOR CANDLES by Josephine Tey. THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is the title of a novel by G.K.CHESTERTON about a socially wellconnected man who knows where all the skeletons of the upper crust are buried but helps keep them buried. It has nothing to do with the plot of the 1934 Hitchcock film.Just why most of his movies changed titles is hard to pinpoint. Obviously box office attraction is involved. SECRET AGENT begins with word during World War I that Willie Ashenden the well known writer is dead. We see a closed coffin wake for the man and when everyone leaves we discover the coffin is empty. Ashenden has gone undercover to do some espionage for the British military during the First World War. He is assisted by Lorre nicknamed The General or the Mad Mexican Lorre is not Mexican in the story. They make an odd pair with Guilgud stiff and proper and Lorre definitely odd looking. They head for Switzerland where they meet several people Carroll Young and Percy Marmont travelling with is wife and dog. Marmont soon appears to be the dangerous German agent that Ashenden and Lorre are to do in. And they do in the most memorable portion of the film  only to discover subsequently that Marmont was not the spy.Of course barring Carroll that leaves only one possibility so the degree of surprise in the plot is less than desirable. Hitch overcomes this by taking our agents into the territories of the Central Powers after Young and here Palmer enters the story briefly  it was an early bit part. The conclusion is an exciting confrontation on a passenger train and a disaster. And Guilgud and Carroll are together for the romantic conclusion not as good a romantic teaming as those of THE THIRTYNINE STEPS or THE LADY VANISHES. Of the major Hitchcock films from 1934 to 1939 SECRET AGENT is not one of the greatest. Guilgud was far too reserved in his part  good enough to watch but one would hardly think he was at that time the leading stage star in Britain. Lorre is better because of his eccentricity and his blending of the sinister and comical he is an assassin after all. Young for the first time played a villain  but nothing like his later performances in THE MORTAL STORM and THEY WON'T BELIEVE ME. Carroll is adequate but her role opposite Robert Donat a year before was more interesting. A slightly better than average Hitchcock movie but not a dull film by any stretch of the imagination.".

	schema:reviewBody "Secret Agent is a cloak and dagger spy yarn set in 1916 amid WWI. Directed by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock it is unfortunately one of the weakest efforts from his British preWWII period.The film opens at the funeral of Captain Edgar Brodie John Gielgudwho has apparently died while home on leave. We learn however that the British government has fabricated the death because they want him to undertake a special mission. From British Intelligence under a character known only as R Charles Carcon Brodie learns that his assignment will be to track down and kill a German spy who is undermining Britain's efforts to form an alliance with Arab countries. To assist him an eccentric character known only as The General Peter Lorre is assigned to him.With his new identity Richard Ashenden he arrives in Switzerland and learns that as a cover he has a wife Elsa Carrington Madeleine Carroll. When he arrives in his room he discovers playboy Robert Marvin Robert Young putting the moves on Elsa. The Ashendens and The General begin their search for the German spy. They are directed to an organist in a small town who has information they need but he is found dead. They then are led to suspect that Cayper Percy Mormont is their man. The men lure him into a ski area and The General causes him to have an unfortunate accident. All the while they are away Marvin continues to pursue Elsa.Later they learn that they have murdered the wrong man and that the real German spy is still at large. The General learns from a comely young wench Lili Lili Palmer that her fianc Howard MarionCrawford may have information that will identify the spy. In the suspenseful climax aboard a train going to Germany................................John Gielgud as good an actor that he was just doesn't come off as a dashing leading man. It's difficult to imagine the beautiful Madeleine Carroll being romantically interested in him. He simply comes across as a stuffed shirt. Peter Lorre is way over the top as The General. His role is played more for comic relief rather than the cold blooded killer he's supposed to be. I'm not quite sure how Robert Young an American came to be cast in this film. In any case he carries off his part quite well. And as was the case in several of his movies Hitchcock again uses a train as a key plot item.Watch for early appearances by Sebastian Cabot Michael Redgrave and Michael Rennie in minor bit roles. I have to say that I missed Hitchcock's trademark cameo in this one. He's gotta be in there some place.".

John Gielgud plays a WWI pilot who is hired by his government as a spy. He meets up with two operatives one who is playing the part of his wife Madeleine Carroll and one who is just Peter Lorre. I'm not sure what his cover was perhaps this is just a small flaw I think that if these were real spies they wouldn't make it very far but I think I'm mature enough to suspend my disbelief on this kind of thing. They are in Switzerland to root out a German spy. Robert Young plays an American tourist who has a thing for Carroll. The script is excellent with some fine dialogue. The characters are well developed. Hitchcock's direction is supertaut. The acting is just great here especially Peter Lorre who is just delicious. One thing to note in this movie as well as Hitch's other 1936 film Sabotage in my opinion one of his greatest achievements is the weight that death carries. In most of his other films the death of a human being is treated rather cynically. One need only view The Trouble with Harry which displays Hitch's wildest cynicism. I don't particularly mind this normally but it's interesting to see the moral implications explored more fully in Secret Agent and Sabotage. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hitchcock directed this thriller based on a novel by W. Somerset Maugham. The movie finds British soldier and novelist Edgar Brodie John Gielgud returning home from WW1 to find that a government agency has faked a report of his death. Indeed they have changed his name to Richard Ashenden. Why? He must now travel to Switzerland and track down and eliminate a ruthless German agent.'Ashenden' is then teamed with two professional agents an amoral deadly assassin known as The General Peter Lorre and Elsa Carrington Madeleine Carroll a beautiful blonde who will pose as his wife and cover for his new identity. The plot strikes several of Hitchcock's famous themes including mistaken identity and murder. But most of all the film is a winding tale of deception. Nothing is what it appears on the surface and people tell lies constantly. Everyone it seems is either impersonating someone else or mistaken for someone else.For one Elsa and Ashenden soon begin to question the morality of the very own mission they have been ordered to undertake. In espionage killing often takes place at close quarters and sometimes innocent lives are lost or at least ruined in the course of a day's work.  We're not hunting a fox. We're hunting a man Ashenden says at one point. The reason being is that they end up killing the wrong man. This scene is very striking with the owner's dog reacting to what we as an audience knows is going to happen... the dog ends up making this terrifying howl.One problem with the film is the 'integrity' of Madeleine Carroll's character Elsa Carrington. Had the British government known how wishy washy she was would she have ever been given such an important mission? Come to think of it how did she even become a spy? Her basic premise is that she doesn't want anyone's death on her conscience the German Agents or any soldiers. So why'd you get involved? Robert Young plays a socalled American playboy named 'Robert Marvin' who develops quite the liking to Elsa. However as I wrote earlier. Deception. Deception. Just as Elsa and Ashenden aren't who they say they are so goes Mr. Marvin. Who it turns out.... is actually the German Agent. Yes the same very agent they've been hunting from the beginning.  It is nice to note as well that is what Mr. Marvin who tiped off our agents to the man who they believed wrongly was the German Agent! Beautiful Misinformation. Love it! John Gielgud is a little stiff in the main role and I for one just think that Madeleine Carroll is way too young for him to be even 'posing' as his wife. Peter Lorre is just a freaking maniac here he is everywhere overacting and proud of it.Kindly tell me who you are what your name is and why your passing yourself off as my wife?  Yes me friend of everyman with beautiful wife. Beautiful accident very very sad but could not be helped. Poor Poor Gentleman!  I was there all right. Half a mile awayat the other end of a telescope. Yet it's quite true. Just one of those long range assassinations. That doesn't make it any better does it? I think your beginning to find that out too? Aren't you?".

	schema:headline " Outlandish spy thriller occasionally awkward but frequently very powerful.";
	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock was riding the crest of one of his early masterpieces The Thirty Nine Steps when he released this unusual spy thriller based on the Ashenden escapades by W. Somerset Maugham. Secret Agent is a very impressive film though one inevitably experiences a mild feeling of anticlimax when Hitch isn't able to reacquire the sublime heights of his previous film. But as we all know it's hard to strike gold EVERY single time so it is perhaps unfair and irrelevant to compare the two films. Secret Agent is a worthy movie in its own right with many powerful sequences and some fascinating performances. Certain moments might seem cluttered or awkward but the overall result is an effective and wellmade film.During World War 1 British Intelligence fakes the death of a popular novelist named Edgar Brodie John Gielgud and give him a new passport and identity. Posing under the name Ashenden he is instructed to travel to Switzerland to locate and eliminate a German spy. It seems the spy in question is just about to head to Arabia to build sympathy and support for the German cause among the various Arab tribes. Ashenden's job is to stop this from happening. Joining Ashenden on his dangerous mission is a Mexican assassin known as the General Peter Lorre and a female spy called Elsa Carrington Madeline Carroll posing as Ashenden's wife. During their hunt for the enemy Elsa finds herself pursued romantically by incorrigible American playboy Robert Marvin Robert Young. Eventually the trio of agents think they've located their target in the shape of an elderly Englishman named Caypor Percy Marmont. They lure him up a mountain on a climbing expedition and kill him only to learn later that they've accidentally assassinated the wrong man. The real German spy is Marvin  Elsa's charming admirer  and in a desperate final chase into enemy territory they try to stop him from making his escape by train to Arabia.The film is quite interesting in showing how Ashenden and Elsa grow to despise the dirty work they're involved in. In espionage killing often takes place at close quarters and sometimes innocent lives are lost or at least ruined in the course of a day's work. While The General takes an obscene pleasure in his murderous trade Ashenden and Elsa find it increasingly distasteful and devious. This kind of reaction is most unusual for a screen hero and it makes the film rather different from the norm. Gielgud is OK in the lead role but he is upstaged by the charismatic Lorre and the gorgeous Carroll. Some scenes in Secret Agent are slightly fudged such as the chase in the chocolate factory which suffers from terribly fuzzy sound quality it seems almost as if the sequence belongs in a silent movie. However other scenes are tremendously powerful especially the tense sequence in which Caypor is mistakenly killed during the climbing trip and the exciting trainset climax. Secret Agent is by no means the best film that Hitchcock made during his illustrious career but it is proof once again that even when he was slightly offform he was more than a match for other directors.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is hard to assign this interwar Hitchcock thriller to any one genre... it is clearly a spy thriller but there are also romantic elements and a good number of comic moments.John Gielgud plays writer Edgar Brodie who returns from service in France in 1916 to learn that he has died while on leave! This is all part of establishing his new cover as Richard Ashenden he is to go to neutral Switzerland with a man known as 'The General' to identify and eliminate a German agent before he can get to Constantinople. When Ashenden gets to Switzerland he is surprised to hear that his 'wife' Elsa has got there ahead of him when he goes up to his room he finds a beautiful blonde wearing nothing but a towel and an American by the name of Robert Martin. It turns out that his boss known as 'R' had sent her to improve his cover he isn't impressed at first though as he sees her as a thrill seeker who doesn't really know how deadly their mission might be. They both learn when Ashenden and The General find their contact dead the only clue to the killer is a button the dead man is clenching. That night at the casino Ashenden accidentally drops the button onto the roulette table. There is a bit of a laugh when it lands on the winning number then another player says he things it must be his... he is an Englishman married to a German woman as he is undoubtedly the spy Ashenden and The General work up a plan to dispatch him. When the job is done Elsa no longer feels what they are doing is exciting and glamorous it is grubby work... and it seems even grubbier when they learn that they got the wrong man! I lead puts them in the right direction but by then their target is on the move heading to Constantinople which is in enemy territory.This Hitchcock film may be over seventy five years old but it doesn't feel particularly dated because it has a decent plot that has a few nice twists without being so convoluted it is hard to follow. The cast did a good job with a young John Gielgud putting in a sold performance as Ashenden Madeleine Carroll was delightful as his 'wife' Elsa... I certainly won't forget her introductory scene and Peter Lorre was particularly entertaining as this lecherous slightly creepy 'foreign gentleman' The General. As one would expect from Hitchcock it was shot in a way that captured the tension of the situation... if you are a fan of Hitchcock's other works or just want to see a thriller that doesn't involve any offensive material then this is well worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "The series of espionage thrillers produced at British Gaumont Pictures in the midtolate 1930s scripted by Charles Bennet and directed by Alfred Hitchcock have a consistent quality to them. They don't repeat characters or plot elements but they all follow a similar winning formula  not merely that of Hitchcockian suspense of which there isn't really that much in Secret Agent but of the notion that scrambling all over Europe bumping off spies and leaping off trains constantly in fear of your own life can be made to look rather good fun.First we have the cast and characterisation. A relatively young John Gielgud takes the lead and although the director reportedly didn't like his performance he does here epitomise the classic British hero. Laid back unassuming with an air of effortlessness he is in some ways reminiscent of a certain other fictional British spy popularised in the latter half of the twentieth century although Gielgud's Ashendon is far more human than the somewhat mechanical Mr Bond. Paired with a bubbly and very believable Madeleine Carroll and supported by bluff gentleman Percy Marmont chirpy yank Robert Young and crazy generic foreigner Peter Lorre the overall feel is like one of those Brits on holiday comedies. The only difference is occasionally people kill each other or send out coded telegrams.Then there is the Charles Bennet screenplay. Bennet was after Elliot Stannard in the silent days the second writer to really work well with The Master of Suspense. Like Hitch Bennet loves double meanings and secret knowledge. Take the scene where Gielgud arrives at the hotel finds out from the clerk that his new persona has a wife. He asks the clerk Did she look well? meaning of course Is she attractive? It is of course a little joke with no bearing on the plot but it's moments like this that keep us engaging with the material and root us in the world of spying and bluffing. He also brings characters in with memorable bits of business to give us strong and meaningful impressions of them  for example Peter Lorre chasing a woman up the stairs or Percy Marmont being introduced when Gielgud trips over his dog.And then there is the director who is let's face it the only reason anyone pays attention to what would otherwise be obscure English films in the first place. Hitchcock has simplified and streamlined his technique which a few years earlier had been little more than a needlessly showy display of camera tricks. He's still not subtle  he never would be  but at least he is now tasteful. We see here his regular method by which the camera leads the audience by the hand dollying in on an object or throwing a closeup at us as if to shout Look at this! What's good about it is that it allows Hitchcock to move the audience at any rate he wants. At the end of the first scene there is a dolly in on a portrait of a soldier. Noone is looking at or gesturing at it but Hitch forces us to take notice. Later when Gielgud walks into his hotel room and finds both Carroll and Young inside there is a quick montage of closeups as he checks he has the right number and we essentially ride with his thought process for a few seconds.Secret Agent is by no means as good as The 39 Steps or The Lady Vanishes not really having any major buildups of suspense or danger. However it does gently pull us along for a wellpaced and slightly irreverent ride and is ultimately watchable because it has very few bad bits. It is a good example what Hitchcock and co. were creating at Gaumont  pictures which were undemanding on the attention because they were smooth unpretentious and yet continually gave us something to tickle the brain.".

	schema:headline " Lots of fun";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a good early effort from Hitchcock. As the title implies it's full of espionage international intrigue and hidden motives and it's very entertaining. A very young John Gielgud is the male lead who becomes embroiled in spy drama at the height of WW1. Madeleine Carroll is the very pretty very English woman who at the behest of the mysterious R comes along to help the British cause by posing as Gielgud's wife. Peter Lorre is Gielgud's curly haired sidekick The General with a ridiculously long name. Robert Young also plays a major role as a young man apparently after the hand of Carroll yet who turns out to be someone far more sinister.I enjoyed this film a lot. Hitchcock didn't have much of a budget to work with in this period yet he creates a lot of suspense with what he has. The film is also very witty and many moments are played for pure comedy. Gielgud is solid as the male lead yet unfortunately lacks charisma. He is very much in the stiff upperlip Brit style and as a young man he hadn't developed enough as an actor to counteract this.

	onyx:emotionText "This is a good early effort from Hitchcock. As the title implies it's full of espionage international intrigue and hidden motives and it's very entertaining. A very young John Gielgud is the male lead who becomes embroiled in spy drama at the height of WW1. Madeleine Carroll is the very pretty very English woman who at the behest of the mysterious R comes along to help the British cause by posing as Gielgud's wife. Peter Lorre is Gielgud's curly haired sidekick The General with a ridiculously long name. Robert Young also plays a major role as a young man apparently after the hand of Carroll yet who turns out to be someone far more sinister.I enjoyed this film a lot. Hitchcock didn't have much of a budget to work with in this period yet he creates a lot of suspense with what he has. The film is also very witty and many moments are played for pure comedy. Gielgud is solid as the male lead yet unfortunately lacks charisma. He is very much in the stiff upperlip Brit style and as a young man he hadn't developed enough as an actor to counteract this.

Despite the creakiness of the film it is a pleasure to see John Gielgud as he must have looked in his theater star days. I enjoyed him most in his scenes of repartee with Peter Lorre and with Madeleine Carroll. He conveys his growing affection for Carroll slowly and subtly and I like the way he befriends Lorre yet manages to make it clear that he doesn't approve of him. However I'm less impressed with the rest of the cast. Madeleine Carroll's performance overall is average and I find it hard to distinguish her from other 30s leading ladies. Peter Lorre always is worth seeing but here a little of his offthewall performance goes a long way. It's interesting to see Robert Young as a young man and as a suspicious character. However his portrayal is too bland to stand out much. Still all in all Secret Agent is well worth seeing. I suggest watching the hotel scenes between Gielgud and Carroll more than onceGielgud really tosses off some witty dialogue and delightful bits of business in those scenes.".

The time is 1916 in the midst of the First World War. An amorous American playboy Robert Young and assorted Europeans are also involved. The film is full of humor and suspense and emotionally rather cool.What makes Secret Agent work is its director and authors' love of paradox and playful irony. Nothing is what it appears on the surface and people tell lies constantly. Everyone it seems is either impersonating someone else or mistaken for someone else. Things never quite go as planned and errors on the parts of all involved abound and multiply as the story proceeds. If one relishes brainy demanding thrillers this one's as good as it gets. The film gets a bit farfetched and melodramatic near the end with a slambang climax and a remarkable garbled statement of identity by the wounded general. For all its minor flaws this is a smart smooth movie one of Hitchcock's most underrated and might have been had it been made twenty years later his Beat the Devil.

	schema:headline " Wow";
	schema:reviewBody "The Battle of Neretva is an often confusing badly edited mess on American home video that is. I've seen multiple versions of this film and combined they make one fine epic. Unfortunately it has yet to be released in its entirety domestically on video or DVD so it's hard for me to piece together a review of 3 entirely different movies.In 1943 Hitler orders the final destruction of the Yugoslav Partisans. The Partisans begin a trek northward to the relative safety of the Bosnian Mountains  their goal is to cross the treacherous Neretva gorge over one remaining bridge. Along the way they battle German tanks Italian infantry Chetnik Cavalry strafing airplanes disease and natural elements.Yugoslav director Bulajic is telling his story from all points of view but his sympathies lie with the Partisans. The film has proCommunist leanings and tells several interwoven stories stressing the importance of comradeship in wartime. There are many important characters Yul Brynner Morituri is crack demolition expert Vlado Sergei Bondarchuk director of Waterloo is shorttempered artillery officer Martin Franco Nero The Mercenary is an Italian Captain with no faith in Fascism Hardy Kruger A Bridge too Far is Colonel Kranzer who fights with dedication which begins to dwindle as he realizes the bitter reality that the partisans are a formidable enemy Ljubisa Samardzic Battle of the Eagles and Sylva Koscina Hornets' Nest are brotherandsister and Koscina is to marry Ivan Lojze Rozman after the war the list goes on and on and although every character is significant it's impossible to list them all. There's an interesting twist too the legendary Orson Welles plays a Chetnik Senator who battles for concessions with General Lohring the great Curd Jurgens a committed Nazi officer who is determined the wipe out the Partisans once and for all. Surprisingly Welles plays his role with boundless passion and gusto and Jurgens departs from his usual role as an antiNazi realist German officer here he is a coldblooded Nazi officer  he may be his usually cool and restrained yet occasionally explosive self  but he's still a coldblooded Nazi.What's important is that unlike many epics such as The Longest Day and Is Paris Burning? every subplot is clear and crucial at all times and Bulajic manages to keep them every character engaging and recognizable at all times. Despite the scope of the battle scenes the audience has a personal involvement with them because they feature characters we've come to care about.These battle scenes are the real stars of the show. They involve thousands of extras dozens of T34 Tiger and Sherman tank German fighter planes huge explosions and stunt horses which get blown in every direction. Bulajic uses wide shots quite often to show just how massive the combat zone is. Battles take place in green valleys narrow streets and in the snowcovered mountains and we can see just hazardous and realistic this scenery is. The Yugoslav landscape has never been so beautifully photographed and the destruction amidst this beauty is quite sad and often depressing. The final scene in which several of the main characters are killed ironically enough the battle takes place amidst an old cemetery is epic in scope with thousands of Chetnik horsemen being gunned down and shelled in a valley but the personal sacrifice of the partisans is felt at the same time. Bernard Hermann's score is appropriately thunderous at times and also has meaningful mournful cues. This music was written exclusively for the edited international versions the original equally fantastic Klaus Vladimir Ratjeric score retained on longer prints and used only to aid the dramatic scenes.This is truly a great epic story with strong character development interwoven with necessary spectacle. Even on home video in the United States it's a good movie and simply improves with each longer cut. The Battle of Neretva is simple one of the great lost films of the 20th Century.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Battle of Neretva is an often confusing badly edited mess on American home video that is. I've seen multiple versions of this film and combined they make one fine epic. Unfortunately it has yet to be released in its entirety domestically on video or DVD so it's hard for me to piece together a review of 3 entirely different movies.In 1943 Hitler orders the final destruction of the Yugoslav Partisans. The Partisans begin a trek northward to the relative safety of the Bosnian Mountains  their goal is to cross the treacherous Neretva gorge over one remaining bridge. Along the way they battle German tanks Italian infantry Chetnik Cavalry strafing airplanes disease and natural elements.Yugoslav director Bulajic is telling his story from all points of view but his sympathies lie with the Partisans. The film has proCommunist leanings and tells several interwoven stories stressing the importance of comradeship in wartime. There are many important characters Yul Brynner Morituri is crack demolition expert Vlado Sergei Bondarchuk director of Waterloo is shorttempered artillery officer Martin Franco Nero The Mercenary is an Italian Captain with no faith in Fascism Hardy Kruger A Bridge too Far is Colonel Kranzer who fights with dedication which begins to dwindle as he realizes the bitter reality that the partisans are a formidable enemy Ljubisa Samardzic Battle of the Eagles and Sylva Koscina Hornets' Nest are brotherandsister and Koscina is to marry Ivan Lojze Rozman after the war the list goes on and on and although every character is significant it's impossible to list them all. There's an interesting twist too the legendary Orson Welles plays a Chetnik Senator who battles for concessions with General Lohring the great Curd Jurgens a committed Nazi officer who is determined the wipe out the Partisans once and for all. Surprisingly Welles plays his role with boundless passion and gusto and Jurgens departs from his usual role as an antiNazi realist German officer here he is a coldblooded Nazi officer  he may be his usually cool and restrained yet occasionally explosive self  but he's still a coldblooded Nazi.What's important is that unlike many epics such as The Longest Day and Is Paris Burning? every subplot is clear and crucial at all times and Bulajic manages to keep them every character engaging and recognizable at all times. Despite the scope of the battle scenes the audience has a personal involvement with them because they feature characters we've come to care about.These battle scenes are the real stars of the show. They involve thousands of extras dozens of T34 Tiger and Sherman tank German fighter planes huge explosions and stunt horses which get blown in every direction. Bulajic uses wide shots quite often to show just how massive the combat zone is. Battles take place in green valleys narrow streets and in the snowcovered mountains and we can see just hazardous and realistic this scenery is. The Yugoslav landscape has never been so beautifully photographed and the destruction amidst this beauty is quite sad and often depressing. The final scene in which several of the main characters are killed ironically enough the battle takes place amidst an old cemetery is epic in scope with thousands of Chetnik horsemen being gunned down and shelled in a valley but the personal sacrifice of the partisans is felt at the same time. Bernard Hermann's score is appropriately thunderous at times and also has meaningful mournful cues.

I wont describe the movie itself you must see it yourself and it is worth it. However I would like to update some potential nonYugoslav viewers about some important facts about that movie. The movie was made in 1969 in that period Yugoslav socialistcommunist as you like itregime was running the most openminded and liberal politics in his whole history. At that time some critics about regimes most outstanding icons were possible. The Partisan movement in WWII was one of them. A figure of a Partisan was in official ideological interpretation considered as a natural born patriot ready to sacrifice fully political aw eared in two words A man of steal almost a mythical figure only possible to be compared with an ancient hero. In Bitka Na Neretvi we are faced with quiet another partisan hero. It is still a hero but the one who knows the fear. One scene is thus so fascinating when you see partisans running off the battle line screaming They are gonna kill us all! Another scene shows elements of Partisan cruelty in discussion what to do with wounded comrades one commandant saysWhats more important the fate of the revolution or the fate of our wounded comrades? That kind of scenes would have been in pure propaganda movie impossible as well as in John Wayne type of war movie. Other details are also very interesting. You would hard to notice the word of communism or communists completely different as another movie Bitka Na Sutjesci. The main hero is thus The People itself. Josip Broz Tito is only present in a short military order. Worth of notification is also the representation of the enemies. Germans are of course evil but described as noble opponents. Italians are sometimes shown almost even more humanly than partisans with moral doubt Two Italian defectors even join partisans. The worst characters are collaborationist Chetniks and Ustashas shown as coldblooded murderers.".

	schema:reviewBody "A grandscale account of one of the most decisive campaigns in the Balkans in World War 2. Considering it was made largely for propaganda purposes THE BATTLE OF NERETVA manages to remain somewhat true to the historical details and certainly delivers on action.This is one of those oldstyle painstakingly flawless films  you know where almost every shot is beautifully composed and it's all directed with a certain dramatic fervor. Before this film I'd only seen low budget smallscale Yugoslavian films so I was surprised they were even capable of this. There's plenty of sweeping shots of thousands of extras battling charging or marching through the snow as far as the eye can see. Add to that even the plain Jane strategy meetings between generals are shot and written to deliver the interesting battle details to make it all make perfect sense. Excellent unflinching air attacks and artillery bombardments sparing us nothing of the constant suffering and loss of life. You really get a great sense of how furious the German high command was and how frustrated they were that the Partisan army could not be knocked out.Add to that a topnotch international cast for the time including Yul Brynner Orson Welles Hardy Kruger Curt Jurgens Anthony Dawson Sylvia Koscina Sergei Bondarchuk and Franco Nero all in substantial roles. A lot of Yugoslavia's top stars of the day make appearances as partisans but unfortunately there's so many that they start to blur into each other after a while. Bondarchuk was given a role and brought on as technical adviser and it's easy to see his hand in things after watching his battle scenes in WAR AND PEACE and WATERLOO.There are several different versions of this film of various lengths. Eastbloc and Westbloc versions tend to be the main alternates from which various other smaller ones were cut. My favorite cuts tend to fall under the Westbloc category as they contain the glorious score by Bernard Herrmann has most of the higher profile names speaking English in their own voices and cut away some of the more outrageous propaganda. Then again the Eastbloc version contains a lot more humanity and fleshes out its characters a lot better but to each his own. The commie version is a character drama the capitalist version is an action movie.Like with any 60's World War 2 film there are plenty of technical inaccuracies and continuity problems due to the budget. For instance a lot of the tanks and planes are improper equipment but at least they made the effort to dress two T34's to look like Tiger tanks. Unfortunately the Germans would have more likely used Panzer III and IV tanks which make no appearance here. Nicely it does include lengthy subplots involving the numerous Nazi collaborators during the war with the climactic battle not being Partisans vs. Germans but Partisans vs. poorlycoordinated and lowmorale Chetnik Militia.This film unsurprisingly enough was followed up with a similar though not quiteasgood yet not entirely deservedly obscure sequel SUTJESKA doubling as a biopic for Yugoslavia's dictator and Partisan leader Josip Tito.".

This is a far superior version professionally edited into a coherent well flowing narrative. It seems that the 102 minute stub has been edited from this. I can only imagine how much deeper the characterization would be with the 40 minutes still missing from the original.

	schema:reviewBody "What is so great about this movie is its near matteroffact portray of the reality of the war namely the bloody defeats and suffering of the partisan army.  This honest portray of what really happened in the past history is often taken for granted in movies made in west but it is extremely rare in the eastern blocks including the formerYugoslavia that is until this movie was made.The movie was based on the historical facts of German attack on the Yugoslavian Communist bases including inflicting great casualties on the partisan army and in addition the logistic parts of the partisan army such as the central hospital and heavy equipment such as artillery and vehicles were completely lost.  However German failed their original objective of eliminating the partisan army once for all in one decisive blow despite the fact wiping out every partisan base and inflicting significant casualties on partisansTito narrowly escaped the German spear head of the assault and successfully planned and lead the remaining forces to break out opening new fronts in Bosnia after escaping and eventually establishing a new base there.  For this reason this battle was considered a victory by partisans because they escaped the total annihilation and with the tiny surviving force they eventually recovered and fight to their final victory.This movie is an relatively accurate portrait of the extremely difficult breaking out attempts and the eventual success of the partisan army a technical defeat but a strategic victory.  In comparison to other war flicks made in communist countries such as that of formerUSSR Romania Vietnam and North Korea this movie presented the facts that most communist regime would rather not want to talk about  the heavy casualties of communist army and its cause the inabilities of the commanders to make the best decision at the right moment at the place.In the war flicks made in the other communist countries listed above the heroes never dies and their commanders never makes mistakes and the enemy was always stupid and incapable.  This movie honestly admits that the enemy is not only better equipped but is equally capable if not better Tito's commanders.  The German war fighting capabilities were given proper credit.In this sense this movie is the Yugoslavian equivalent of The Longest Day made in USA in which Germans were treated as they were  human beings and professional soldiers who did their job despite the failure of their high command.  Although there are still obvious onesided scenes due to obvious political reasons such as the world is bleeding when a partisan was killed the movie is far better than any others made in the communist countries and for its honest description of the history it deserves a perfect ten.".

	schema:headline " A Tough Partisan Nut";
	schema:reviewBody "Allegedly the most expensive film ever undertaken by the Yugoslav film industry The Battle Of The Neretva is a tribute to the Partisan army that Josip Broz Tito raised to resist the Nazi occupation of his country. Operating in the mountains the Partisans proved to be tough nut to crack for the occupying Axis armies.The country of Yugoslavia which was created by the Allied countries at the Versailles Treaty did not long out last the man who saved it. That was once Yugoslavia is several separate states now. It was an unwieldy conglomerate nation composed of several ethnic groups with various religious backgrounds who had a legacy of Balkan hate of centuries. The Chetniks who collaborated with the Nazis just wanted to make sure they came out on top no matter who won the war. The monarchy of Yugoslavia was that of the former Serbia raised to be ruling all of what became Yugoslavia. No one who was Croatian Montenegran Macedonian etc. wanted Serbian primacy. The Marxist Tito was more acceptable to most than a Serbian king.A lot of the politics is necessary to know in order to understand what was going on while this battle was being fought. The Germans launched an offensive in the winter of 1943 aimed at wiping out Tito's Partisans and they did drive them to the Neretva River where ordered to stand with their backs to said river offering no retreat the Partisans turned around and instead and kicked Nazi butt.The Battle Of Neretva is a brutally uncompromising film about ugly guerrilla war and the version I saw is a slimmed down version. I'm betting I would have rated it higher had I seen the original 3 hours the film's release in Yugoslavia was exhibited at.Such various international players as Yul Brynner Franco Nero Orson Welles Curt Jurgens and Hardy Kruger all have some interesting cameos. But the stars are the Yugoslav players most of you won't know in this film. I'm sure the Oscar for Best Foreign language film is based on the Academy voters having the original to judge.This film is a nice tribute to a part of World War II that is not talked about too much in the west.".

The Partisans left no onebehind. Not even their wounded. They also had refugees withthem and they all had to get across the river before the Germans blow the bridge. They also have to contend with the Italians and a regiment of Cetnik Cavalry. Why are the Germans about to blowthe last bridge across the Neretva? Because they're afraid of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. It's January 1943 and the Germans are afraid that the Allies are going to invade the Balkans whichthey never did but still they have to isolate the Partisans. Blowing the last bridge over the Neretva would do that. Do the Germansblow the bridge or do the Partisans escape before the bridge isblown? Do you think I'm an idiot? I'm not telling.

	schema:headline " Epic international Yugoslavian war flick";
	schema:reviewBody "There were quite a few proPartisan Yugoslavian WWII films to come out of the Balkans during the 1960s and 1970s but THE BATTLE ON THE RIVER NERETVA is definitely the biggest and most expensive the result of a collaboration between West Germany America and Italy as well as Yugoslavia itself. The film proudly shows its budget from the very beginning as it is as packed with as much action and battling as you could want from any war movie. The film takes the format of having lots of different subplots with different characters subplots which play out against numerous skirmishes and battles as Yugoslavian refugees attempt to flee across the titular bridge and are hounded by the Nazis the Italians and even Fascist Yugoslavians at every turn. The action scenes in the film are largely authentic with planes bombing all over the place tank attacks and plenty of machinegun firing on the battlefields. The Yugoslavian scenery snowy and rugged is put to very good usage and only adds to the realism of the movie.Unfortunately the storyline is little more than an us vs. them narrative and it remains difficult to engage with many of the leading players due to the fragmented nature of the plot. Additionally while the nonYugoslavian cast members are easy to spot many Yugoslavians play the young male heroes and it is often difficult to tell them apart  or even tell who they are! The film benefits from three massive Hollywood stars imported from America to add to the spectacle. Curd Jurgens is the Nazi commander but unfortunately for him he's relegated to a desk role never leaving his office through the movie at least his scenes were easy to shoot then. Also on hand is an elderlylooking but stern Orson Welles playing a Chetnik senator who comes off worst in the battle with his own general and finally we have Yul Brynner star billed but hardly in the movie excellent as an engineer responsible for rigging explosives all over the landscape. Brynner is always wicked and of course he ends up as the best thing in the film it's just a shame that we end up seeing so little of him for much of it.A number of Italian actors and actresses have also been imported into the scenery revealing the influence that Italy had in this film's production. Former peplum actress Sylva Koscina gets to wield a gun and act tough for a change while Howard Ross is as dependable as ever. Italian film regular Hardy Kruger also pops up and given his nationality you can guess he's on the Nazi side. Best of all is Franco Nero playing an Italian general who ends up defecting to the other side when he sees the devastation left by the Nazis Nero is as blueeyed and heroic as ever and he gets to engage in a great protracted death scene including a shot of him hanging over a wooden cross complete with bloodied hands which is a neat homage to Django.Other than the lack of a main storyline the major problem with the film is the running time which means that some scenes  definitely around the saggy middle  become a bit boring especially when there's no actual fighting going on. However things pick up for a rousing climax in which lots of the good guys die their heroic touching deaths and the Nazis are bombed to hell!".

Best of all is Franco Nero playing an Italian general who ends up defecting to the other side when he sees the devastation left by the Nazis Nero is as blueeyed and heroic as ever and he gets to engage in a great protracted death scene including a shot of him hanging over a wooden cross complete with bloodied hands which is a neat homage to Django.Other than the lack of a main storyline the major problem with the film is the running time which means that some scenes  definitely around the saggy middle  become a bit boring especially when there's no actual fighting going on. However things pick up for a rousing climax in which lots of the good guys die their heroic touching deaths and the Nazis are bombed to hell!";

Also for lack of a better word...it's 'foreign' to most...uncommon. The same with Poland's Katyn2007 Italy's Torpedo Zone1955 and many others...The Netherlands' Soldier of Orange1977.Although these 'same' T34 Russian tanks converted into Tiger 1 German tanks and American Sherman tanks are in the same movie as well as the American M3 halftracks converted to German Sd.Kfz. 251s because it's a Hollywood production 'filmed in Yugoslavia' everyone in the world can see Kelly's Heroes1970 but rarely this great movie. Just as everyone can see Hollywood's Battle of the Bulge1965 and Patton1970 both filmed 'mainly' in Spain that use the same tanks...because it's bigbudget Hollywood. Hollywood is great but it sometimes leaves equally great nonHollywood movies behind and sadly forgotten.To me this is likely the best eastern European war documentarymovie production ever. The German movie Stalingrad1993 filmed in Germany Finland Czech Republic and Italy is another sadly 'forgotten great.'As per national budget at that time this movie's ranks up there with Doctor Zhivago1965 Lawrence of Arabia1963 The Guns of Navarone1961 The Sand Pebbles1966 and A Bridge Too Far1977.This movie even has an international 'Hollywood' moviemaking cast  Yul Brynner and Oleg VidovRussia Hardy Kruger and Curt Jrgens Germany Franco NeroItaly Orson WellsUSA Sergey BondarchukUkraine Sylva KoscinoCroatia and Anthony DawsonScotland. Despite this...this great movie isn't nearly as famous as similar Hollywood movies that take place in 'Yugoslavia' like Force 10 From Navarone.If you're a World War II buff who likes to see every aspect of that war even the lesserknown parts...see this.".

But this would not be 100 true plus every war story is unique and we must respect that. So I'm reviewing Bitka na Neretvi as if it wasn't influenced by other WWII titles which again isn't the reality either. So it's the partisans communist rebels facing off against the Germans and their allies. As a background information we must know the fights against the civil population on the Balkans really got nasty in the war. If someone from the locals threw a hand grenade killing a soldier multiple civilians got massacred by the Nazis. It means the Yugoslavs had a good reason for wanting to glorify their heroes. It must have been very annoying to see all the western movies being released about various world war deeds but they didn't have their own though they had numerous stories about total war to tell. All these feelings manifested in this movie a superproduction of the time. They contracted a handful of worldwide stars for the main roles and they did well! Sergey Bondarchuk felt so natural in every sketch as father of the soldiers. Then there is Hardy Krger the German general  the most German man they could find on the piece of Earth actual Nazis unfortunately died or were too old by the time of filming. Brynner Dawson Welles also were magnificent I'm sure money wasn't the sole reason motivating them to take part in the creation of this movie. However the Yugoslavian actors...some of them were fine but the more minor the role got the stupider they looked on the screen. At some crowd scenes you can clearly notice something is wrong...the people just wander around like in a zombie movie. Unless it's a crowd scene with horses  those are breathtaking without a doubt. Speaking of horses I'm not sure this would qualify for the no animals were harmed in the making stamp  lots of brutal battle scenes and fantastic control of the animals not to mention the bridge  I really appreciated that can't see action like that in today's films. Costumes and sets are fine as far as I can tell they looked authentic. I don't know if they had luck with the snow and weather during filming but even with the mediocre cinematography the locations seem rather beautiful. One thing the woman protagonist's makeup and hair. I don't want to disclose too much info to avoid spoilers but it was a big negative for me  it's like she stepped out of some kind of '60s shampoo advert not a WWII production. Again something that shows the Yugoslavs inexperience with feature films. The main line in the storytelling is rather straightforward and easy to follow but the side stories sometimes get a bit shaky. I'm not sure it was a good decision to try and feature all off these aspects in this short playtime. Still in the end I stood up satisfied this is a war movie to watch for any war movie enthusiast and probably the best one about the Balkan battlefield.".

And it's worth it. If you're not a war veteran you've never seen anything like this.But this film is much more than its fx. It's a deep moving story told on the grand scale with Oscarclass cinematography. It is both a major outdoor adventure and a small intimate story. It has some of the quirkiest scenes blackest humor and darkest betrayals too.Don't look for it on TV unless Turner Classic Movies shows it uncut. It was horribly mutilated in editing for television and therefore unpopular and rarely shown. Get the original theatrical version and watch it undisturbed.

	schema:headline " Leone's most underrated filma rich masterpiece which gets better and better with each viewing";
	schema:reviewBody "It's generally thought that this film is Leone's weakest major filmand it is far less well known than the Dollars trilogy and the two Once Upon a Times. In actual factthis is a masterpiece that deserves to be far better known and regarded than it actually is. It sees Leone attempting new things such as character development and political commentwhile refining elements from his earlier films. It's really the bridge between Once Upon A Time In The West and Once Upon A Time In Americaand it contains a great many elements of both films which let's face itdespite both being Leone films are quite different.It starts in humorous veinright from the opening sequence of the dirtyvery poor Rod Steiger character Juan being taunted by some rich folk aboard a lavish carriagethe camera showing lots of close ups of mouths and eyes in what almost seems a parody of Leone's style. Juan is much like Tuco in The Good the Bad And The Uglyloudsimple and very funny he's even often accompanied by comical music .Juan's first encounters with the other main protagonistIRA man Sean James Coburn are treated like comical duelsand as they go to rob a bank it seems the picaresque tone will continue.Howeverabout a third of the way through the film becomes more and more serious. As Juanthanks to Seanbecomes more and more involved in the Mexican Revolutionthe tone becomes darker as more and more scenes take place at night and there is serious tragedy. The change in tone may jar to some peoplebut one can see the maturecontemplative Leone of Once Upon A Time In America reveal himself before our eyes.Of course there are still some great action scenessuch as the taking of a bank which is superbly cut to Ennio Morricone's music listen for the cheeky quotes from Mozart!or Sean and Juan machinegunning what seems like a whole army. There is as usual a great deal of violencebut it's less personal and graphic and instead is shown to have more consequence. The film's plot does move rather slowlywith Leone taking his time as usualbut this mean we can more enjoy the mannered Steiger and the laid back Coburn as one of the greatest partnerships in cinema history.Of particular interest are the several flashbacks dotted throughout the movieshot in dreamlike slow motion and usually set to what is quite simply one of the most beautiful film themes EVER Morricone excels himself with the score for this film. Representing Sean's pastthey ask as many questions as they answerLeone trusting his audience to work things out. The final one is missing from many versions of this filma tragedy because as well as being sublimely beautiful and ambiguousis it Sean's memory?a marijuanaenhanced hallucination?a vision of Heaven? it adds yet another element to the story.A Fistful Of Dynamite wellthe French Once Upon A Time..The Revolution is the films' best titleis a masterpieceit's extremely entertaining whilst also being full of complexity. Things become clearer and more interesting on second and third viewings. Don't expect the operatic ritualism of Once Upon in The West or the comic crowd pleasing of the Dollars filmsbut if you watch this you will be watching a cinematic master at the height of his powers.".

It sees Leone attempting new things such as character development and political commentwhile refining elements from his earlier films. It's really the bridge between Once Upon A Time In The West and Once Upon A Time In Americaand it contains a great many elements of both films which let's face itdespite both being Leone films are quite different.It starts in humorous veinright from the opening sequence of the dirtyvery poor Rod Steiger character Juan being taunted by some rich folk aboard a lavish carriagethe camera showing lots of close ups of mouths and eyes in what almost seems a parody of Leone's style. Juan is much like Tuco in The Good the Bad And The Uglyloudsimple and very funny he's even often accompanied by comical music .Juan's first encounters with the other main protagonistIRA man Sean James Coburn are treated like comical duelsand as they go to rob a bank it seems the picaresque tone will continue.Howeverabout a third of the way through the film becomes more and more serious. As Juanthanks to Seanbecomes more and more involved in the Mexican Revolutionthe tone becomes darker as more and more scenes take place at night and there is serious tragedy. The change in tone may jar to some peoplebut one can see the maturecontemplative Leone of Once Upon A Time In America reveal himself before our eyes.Of course there are still some great action scenessuch as the taking of a bank which is superbly cut to Ennio Morricone's music listen for the cheeky quotes from Mozart!or Sean and Juan machinegunning what seems like a whole army. There is as usual a great deal of violencebut it's less personal and graphic and instead is shown to have more consequence. The film's plot does move rather slowlywith Leone taking his time as usualbut this mean we can more enjoy the mannered Steiger and the laid back Coburn as one of the greatest partnerships in cinema history.Of particular interest are the several flashbacks dotted throughout the movieshot in dreamlike slow motion and usually set to what is quite simply one of the most beautiful film themes EVER Morricone excels himself with the score for this film. Representing Sean's pastthey ask as many questions as they answerLeone trusting his audience to work things out. The final one is missing from many versions of this filma tragedy because as well as being sublimely beautiful and ambiguousis it Sean's memory?a marijuanaenhanced hallucination?a vision of Heaven? it adds yet another element to the story.A Fistful Of Dynamite wellthe French Once Upon A Time..The Revolution is the films' best titleis a masterpieceit's extremely entertaining whilst also being full of complexity. Things become clearer and more interesting on second and third viewings. Don't expect the operatic ritualism of Once Upon in The West or the comic crowd pleasing of the Dollars filmsbut if you watch this you will be watching a cinematic master at the height of his powers.";

	schema:headline " Sergio Leone's Sad Funny Beautiful Epic Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Coming off the triumphs of his Man With No Name series and his frustrations with the cutting of The Good The Bad  The Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West Sergio Leone directed the big budget epic western originally titled Once Upon a Time in the Revolution. Since ...West had been released by Paramount and United Artists was releasing ...Revolution some executive decide the rename the movie Duck! You Sucker! after the phrase Sean James Coburn uses repeatedly before blowing someone or something up with dynamite. Likely the same executive choose an advertising campaign reminiscent of The Good The Bad  The Ugly creating caricatures of Sean and Juan Rod Steiger adding the caption ...the master of adventure Sergio Leone. Well I doubt many theater audiences knew who Sergio Leone was since he was yet to be recognized as a directoral genius the equal of John Ford or Howard Hawks. Worse the advertising implied Duck! You Sucker! was a laugh romp a parody of Leone's early masterpieces. This impression was made even worse when the film failed to perform. In any event A Fistfull of Dyanmite was a dismal failure at the box office and Leone never made another big budget western drama.It's too bad because A Fistfull of Dynamite is Leone's trueist work his most accurate vision of life politics and revolution. Neither Rod Steiger nor James Coburn were strongly associated with westerns even though both played strong roles in earlier films Steiger in Run of the Arrow and Jubal Coburn in The Magnificent Seven and Ride Lonesome. Worse Steiger's Juan looked like something of a buffoon and the movies villains were bland and underdeveloped. However I believe this was Leone's intention corrupt politicians and Prussian officers are pretty well interchangeable. Kill one and another pops up. This isn't a very satisfying truth but it is truth nonetheless. Juan is a peasant a bandit with a large family of bandits. Sean is a Irish Republican Army terrorist an explosives expert. In Leone's world or at least in all his films there are only two types of people predators and victims. His major characters are all predators. The only thing that distinguishes his protagonists from his antagonists is that his antagonists start with a large body count and his protagonists usually spare the innocent. That works with a taut enough storyline but ...Dynamite covers large areas of real estate and the goal is never clear. Juan didn't plan to become a hero of the revolution and that is small payment for his losses. When one looks at history the rewards of revolution and warfare are never worth the sacrifices for just as we kill one bastard another takes his place.I think A Fistfull of Dynamite largely reflects Leone's fate as well. Leone proved he was the greatest western director in less than four years with only four major films. Yet he was hardly appreciated during his short life and only a few films after his magnificent achievement. A Fistfull of Dynamite is also Leone's saddest movie. A beautiful big budget metaphor for a man's talent wasted by underappreciate film executive and smug selfserving critics.Coburn should have won an Oscar for Dynamite. With the exception of some tabletop model trains the effects are convincing and exciting. The color cinematography is phenomenal clearly the equal of Once Upon a Time in the West. The sound and music by Ennio Morricone is phenomenal as usual. While not as satisfying as Leone's best films A Fistfull of Dynamite is an exemplary film. I give it a 9.".

	schema:reviewBody "With Fistful of Dyanmite a.k.a. 'Duck You Sucker' a.k.a. 'Once Upon a Time in the Revolution' the second part of a 'trilogy' legendary Sergio Leone puts together something experimental even more so than the other films in his catalog. Here he now deals with war but he still has the crime elements of his 'dollars' films it somehow makes a very clear cut balance between bits of comedy within the tragedy worked in the story it isn't very brutal but it is graphic in the genre sense of the time. It's also one of his best films if you happen to see it within its full running time like most of Leone's films this suffered drastic cuts in American versions reducing critical character points and other Leone surprises.A Leone film however can only be as strong as the leads pushing it up as in the dozens and dozens of westerns and other films that inspired Leone. Here he uses two character actors for the most part of their careers but indeed very good and astute ones at playing their parts. Rod Steiger who has been in classic films like On the Waterfront and The Pawnbroker here is slightly like a maturer version of Tuco from The Good the Bad and the Ugly he's still a bandit with pillaging and beating and raping his way across the countryside but he's also got a family to look after who within his antihero heart are the most important things to him. Steiger's Juan is usually either surprised quietly delighted or agitated off to certain degrees. He plays this for all it's worth but he also finds the best notes in the moments when he brings out laughs and in the more sorrowful moments later on in the film.There's also James Coburn veteran of many many films given one of the great themes of any character in a Leone film by composer Ennio Morricone there's some sort of instrument or distortion of one in his theme that calls for complete unusual attention on the viewer. Coburn's Sean err John depending is a character with some ghosts perhaps in his past and who unlike Juan is more interested in 'other' interests. Although Juan tries not to notice it until the sequence at Mesa Verde which I won't reveal Sean has been through a revolution in Ireland and understand more or less what happens with it. He brings in Juan after a rather strange yet hilarious encounter into his web of revolutionary fighters which doesn't go over to well with him at first. As their story unravels Coburn still plays it like a pro being the straight character to Steiger's very theatricallike performance. He doesn't quite have the mystery an Eastwood or Bronson had in the other Leone films but he does carry a certain quality about him that puts him in a needed place in the Leone cannon.Speaking of which one must not overlook how complex a film like this is in some ways. Leone was not originally the director it went through the hands of Peter Bogdanovich and Sam Peckinpah before coming to him coincidentally the opening scene with Juan is a cool homage to the Wild Bunch opening. Yet somehow he puts his stamp and wonderful mark on Fistful of Dynamite. This time more history is worked into the film unlike the civil war acting like a harsh backdrop to the more 'fun' elements of the adventure in The Good the Bad and the Ugly the war in this film affects the main character and adds a serious tone to an otherwise standard genre picture. The Steiger character along with the audience gets a look at a massive amount of death or rather the images of the dead a tower filled with soldiers blown at night the powerful pans and camera moves across the bodies real combat and the suggestions of what goes into the revolution. But its not just the violence of battles that get into the film its also the personal attitudes during the revolution the bourgeois vs the peasants one of Leone's masterstrokes at closeups in montage is displayed when Juan is on the train with the near monstrous American wealthy early in the film. Leone manages to work in various and cinematic explosions indepth or testing closeups and sweeping long shots of soldiers landscapes and struggle.Coming back to Ennio Morricone's score this time Morricone experiments with some styles of his talents. As when Leone uses a funny almost cartoonlike image above Sean from Juans' eyes of a 'Banco' sign akin the a 'dollar' sign above cartoon characters Morricone adds a church organ and choir to go along with it. There are also the uses of themes throughout the film as in Leone's other films that act like striking beautiful calling cards. The opening theme is pounding Sean's flashbacks are given the sumptuous qualities that go with the best and worst nostalgia the scenes with action and suspense though almost a little standard still work far better than many standard score of today. Fistful of Dynamite is entertainment on an epic scale with a broader and somewhat deeper subtext and it comes out with flying colors. Some may not take to it it could be argued that Steiger much like Eli Wallach isn't very convincing as a Mexican bandit or that the shifting in tones is a little much even conventional in a weird sense. But it's hard to argue the sense of control that Leone has over his environment in the film the assuredness of style and that at the least the parts are greater than the whole. For me it's a film I've seen twice in one week once to soak in and get more of the enjoyment the second time to get even more out of it and to notice the visual details and I hope it gets better the next time around.".

	schema:reviewBody "A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE aka DUCK YOU SUCKER 5 outta 5 starsI think this is Sergio Leone's third greatest movie... right after Once Upon a Time in the West and The Good The Bad and the Ugly.  Most Leone fans rank this film a lot lower... but I think that's because they are only familiar with the shortened two hour version.  Also for the record I absolutely loathe the retitling... A Fistful of Dynamite... how lame!  At least the original Leone title Duck You Sucker was... distinctive.  Even the French title translation Once Upon a Time... The Revolution is kinda classy. But AFOD???  Gimme a break!  This movie has absolutely nothing to do with A Fistful of Dollars so why even try to make the comparison?Anyway I loved this movie when I first saw it in the theatre in 1972 age 12.  I am pretty sure that what we saw at the time was the lengthy uncut version... and I don't remember being bored at all.  The most common complaint about this movie is that it is slow and boring... heck that's the most common complaint about EVERY Leone movie.  Rod Steiger and James Coburn play Sean and Juan respectively a poor Mexican bandit and a fugitive Irish terrorist... who meet up in Mexico and become involved against their wills with revolutionary warfare in that struggling country.  The movie is exciting funny dramatic suspenseful and well just plain brilliant. This is Ennio Morricone's greatest film score and the way it meshes with Leone's visuals is simply amazing... particularly in my favourite scene... the bank heist.  Juan and his young sons break into the Bank of Mexico shoot it out with the guards and go from door to door searching for gold and finding only political prisoners until finally... oh I can't give it away!  See it for yourself.  This is a movie filled with classic scenes Coburn's arrival on the motorsickle and his confrontation with Steiger's gang... Steiger and Coburn with their machine guns... Steiger's final act of vengeance which is severely chopped to bits in the short version... robbing it of its vicious power.  Its been said that Steiger's comical accent is stereotypical and insulting... but I say NO!  He is playing one of the richest and most complex characters of his career... with some of his greatest speeches And what happens to the poor people?  They are DEAD!. Not to slight James Coburn who also does a fantastic job but Steiger is the star of this one.".

	schema:headline " A typically strong Leone film with added interesting political content";
	schema:reviewBody "John Malloy is an IRA explosives expert on the run in Mexico. Juan Miranda is a Mexican bandit with no interest in the political upheaval in his country and only a dream of hitting the large bank his father once failed to rob. When the two meet Juan sees John's explosives as the way into the ban but John has no interest and it is only when Juan frames him for the murder of some senior soldiers that John relents. Arriving in the town the bank looks like a simple hit if they can find some way of distracting the masses of soldiers that now control the small town  luckily the revolution is in full swing and rebels are in great demand but it is not long before Juan's idea of a simple bank robbery sees him up to his neck in a struggle that he has no interest in.Many reviewers have said how strong the Leone formula is and I won't be able to add much to their words but for me this is a fine film mainly because it takes apart yet another of the cinema myths of the noble revolutionary fighters and has a fascinating thread of political commentary running all the way through it. It doesn't open this way though rather it starts with Leone's usual brand of wit and confrontation between John and Juan and it all feels like it will be similar and just as good to some of Leone's other westerns. However about an hour in it becomes more interesting thanks to the rather shocking portrayal of the revolution on both sides and the ripping into the ideas behind it. It only adds to the basic plot and when it becomes the main focus the film is stronger for it although Leone's Marxist views may be a little hard to swallow for some viewers in the west. That said it does still work as a typical Leone western and fans of his will still love this film.The cast is good but you gotta wonder how those accents would have been mauled if the film had not been as roundly good  certainly Coburn's attempts at an Irish brogue are not the most convincing I've heard. Other than that though he is good in the lead role coping well with making an IRA character likeable without damaging the cynicism and regret that exists within him. His flashback scenes are convincing even if it is not that important to the main thrust of the film. Steiger is less serious at first but develops his character well despite having to cope with a road to Damascus moment as part of it. He is consistently amusing as a character and he does tend to dominate his scenes to good effect. Support is fine but really these two men are the film and they do it very well coping with the laughs tension and political commentary equally well.Overall a typically strong film from Leone that has all his usual formula touches as well as plenty of commentary of value. The direction and use of music are as good as always and the cast cope well with the demands of the script. Reviewers who have taken this as an attack on John Ford's idea of the revolutionary Irishman are perhaps a little off since the film only confirms Ford's usual pointing out of printing the myth but it still has plenty of value and interesting political commentary.".

	schema:headline " Kind of like The Odd Couple with explosions";
	schema:reviewBody "A Fistful of Dynamite is often seen as the black sheep of Sergio Leone's commercial releases and there's a good reason for that as despite the fact that it's still a spaghetti western it's a completely different kettle of fish to both the Dollars Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West. A Fistful of Dollars features common western themes such as bandits guns and bank robberies  but as he did with The Good The Bad and The Ugly Sergio Leone has implanted war themes into the plot and we've also got the bizarre idea of one of the major characters being an IRA bomber! All this stuff doesn't quite come together cleanly and as the tone of the movie changes often it seems obvious that Leone has bitten off a bit more than he can chew...but luckily enough A Fistful of Dynamite remains a fun movie for most of its duration. The plot follows a bandit named Juan who bumps into a dynamiteladed bomber one day in the desert. Spotting an opportunity for robbery he manages to recruit the IRA man to his cause but he doesn't count on being dragged into the revolution that's going on at the same time.The first half of the movie features some very astute elements of tongueincheek humour and it seems obvious that the director isn't intending the plot to be completely serious. However at around the halfway point the movie turns in completely the opposite direction and the fun and silly first half gives way to a more deep and serious finale. For me this is the movie's main problem I like a movie that's unpredictable but this change in plot feels disjointed and doesn't go down well. The second half of the film isn't as enjoyable to watch either which harms the fun. However Sergio Leone's direction is as impressive as ever with some lovely wide angle shots capturing the beautiful landscapes while of course Leone enjoys giving full focus to his actors for some extreme closeups. Like the movie the cast is a mixed bag. James Coburn looks the part but his silly puton accent makes him feel like he's having a laugh at times and similarly Rod Steiger dons an arguably even sillier accent and doesn't quite get away with it. Overall A Fistful of Dynamite is not a film to please all viewers. I found it to be enjoyable despite many niggles but I can understand why a lot of people disagree.".

	schema:headline " Just saw the restored print";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a shame that most people will not get to see this film on the big screen. The new print makes the film look like it was shot recently. The sound has been re mastered also and is 90 perfect. A few of the restored scenes help the film along although they add to the already long running time. It is slightly different from the LaserDIsc version that came out a few years ago especially the end scene. However one friend a film reviewer told me that it's the same version that he saw when it came out in 1972 for two weeks before it was pulled retitled and cut.I have to say that this film is one of Leone's best and I now rate it above Once Upon a Time in America. It's not an easy film and there are a few flaws but in a strange way it is the most human film Leone made. Coburn and Steiger both come off as real people despite the occasional lapse in accents. It's amazing how much time Leone gave to searing closeups of the two actors and how they were able to convey so much of the story in silence. The story is very subtle and very unsubtle at the same time which can make following the film hard if you are expecting the hello stupid storytelling we get these days. Leone did the same thing in Once upon a Time in the West and America. There's a storytelling genius here that's all the more amazing if you consider that Leone was operating out of his native language.What makes this film stand out is the outright message Leone conveys with the story. He didn't do that with any of his other films.A few words on the restored scenes. As with other Leone films that have undergone editing by American distributors the removed scenes are a mixed bag. Some scenes were removed for length purposes others for content reasons and some I suspect were removed because they were perceived as not up to the quality of the rest of the film. This was certainly the case for The Good The Bad  The Ugly. In Duck You Sucker the restored opening helps the film's message which is probably not what the American censors though it was. The stagecoach robbery rape scene which in the American version was edited in a way to suggest that Juan is really a gentleman thief not a rapist is problematic unless you read it as a political comment and even then it's tough to take. The churchyard sequence which is completely absent in the American version is one of Leone's clumsiest scenes and it's absence didn't really affect the film. Some of it is out of focus! The ending sequence was apparently reedited by Leone after the opening in Europe and exists in several different versions over there! The version we see here is very very long but illuminates the main characters motivations better then the American version.Hopefully this limited rerelease signals the soon arrival of a DVD version.Update July 2007 Finally the DVD has been released. After watching the restored restored version I have to add that the film really holds up. This version is identical to the screened version except for one minor yet important difference at the very end. A crucial line from the American version has been restored. The extras deserve some mention. First of all they all have a copyright of 2005 which indicates that the release of this DVD was delayed for some reason. The interviews are very interesting but each extra is heavily intercut with scenes from the film the clips are frequently unrelated to the topic and often the same clips are repeated in each extra! You get to see James Coburn running in a field in Ireland over and over. One extra tracks the different versions that exist of this film shows stills from scenes that Leone cut before the premier in Italy the negatives of these particular scenes have apparently been destroyed and leads into a rumination on the SeanJohn confusion. The writer of this extra then comes to the conclusion that Sean isn't the James Coburn character! I don't agree at all but it's a useful extra.A DVD to own.".

	schema:reviewBody "Duck You Sucker 1971 aka A Fistful of Dynamite is an underrated gem that undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone. Anyone who has seen the Dollars Trilogy can easily mistake Leone for a mere showman but those who have had the privilege of watching his more personal works like Once Upon a Time in America would know better. Leone was indeed a master showman but he knew well how to blend style with substance.In the Dollars Trilogy style clearly is the real driver but deep down there is strong sense of realism that a keen eyed viewer wouldn't find hard to discern. The conspicuous levity only serves the purpose of a translucent film used to hide the naked reality so as to protect an average viewer from getting jumpy at its very sight. In Duck You Sucker this translucent film only happens to be a fraction more transparent than usual. In other words Leone chooses to be a bit more direct in his presentation of realism most evident in the firing squad sequences. Duck You Sucker thus serves to be a perfect amalgamation of style and substance.In many ways Duck You Sucker happens to be Leone's darkest work. And how could it not have been? For the movie revolves around a highly unlikely union of a Mexican bandit and an Irish dynamite expert caught in the turmoil of the Mexican revolution. The only thing that unites these two completely different personalities is the fact that one is called Juan and the other John. Juan sees this coincidence as a divine signal. That their union is meant to serve a much greater purpose to rob the great bank of Mesa Verde. The loquacious Juan desperately tries to convince the taciturn John but the later remains uninterested. Thus ensues a tantalizing game of cat and mouse between Juan and John as the two try their best to outwit each other only to be united by an eternal bond of friendship.There are scenes in Duck You Sucker that will stay with the viewer for ever. There are dialoguesmonologues spoken as well as unspoken that will leave a lasting impact on the viewer. Juan's commentary on his own understanding of the word revolution is one. There's is another when a caged bird defecates on Juan's head and the bandit looks up and says For the rich you sing! Ennio Morricone's mystical music will continue to haunt the viewer much beyond the length of the movie. The movie's use of nonverbal language is probably as strong as the use of verbal one best explained by Rod Steiger's expressions of elation shock disgust and selfpity. Duck You Sucker is Sergio Leone's second best work after Once Upon a Time in America and features an unforgettable performance from the great Rod Steiger who is well complemented by James Coburnin arguably his best role ever. Duck You Sucker will serve as an elixir for any intelligent viewer and offers enough food for thought to keep him occupied until long after the film the over.httpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

	schema:reviewBody "At first I was going to rate this a 9 because I felt like my praise for this film was influenced by the fact that it was made Sergio Leone one of my absolute favourite directors and that it would seem odd to give so many of his films a 10. However the truth is his films usually are that great with the exception of his preFistfull of Dollars movies and upon further reflection I realized that I really do think this film deserves a 10.This film certainly has a much more profound and very moving exploration of the main characters' lives and relationships than Leone's prior films. This is one of the key elements here as the story really gets deep into the psyches and emotions of Juan and Sean revolves heavily around the development of their relationship and truly explores their places roles and goals in life as well as how Juan must figure out and cope with his future.The film is profound in other ways going deeper than the surface of politics and revolution. As is usual with Leone nothing is clear cut and even though the film makes the revolution appear justified in theory with the rich and powerful being pretty darn bad the good guys and the revolutionaries are themselves complex and not entirely noble although I should point out that this is not entirely original since the earlier A Bullet for the General showed similar complexities in the same subject even if it seemed more political and prorevolution. Juan and his family are essentially bandits interested in enriching themselves rather than improving society yet they are protagonists and they become accidental revolutionaries showing that revolutionaries weren't always fighting for just reasons or ideals. Moreover revolutionary leaders are shown as flawed and in some ways weak and hypocritical while the revolutionaries are not above spilling a little extra blood.The film is also the first of Leone's films to have an ending that is in some ways truly sad. The ending in Once Upon a Time in the West had some sadness to it but it was greatly mitigated and had a different emphasis and focus. Here one really feels Juan's loss after his life has been turned upside down his family who were the entire base of his existence wiped out the new friend whose relationship with him the film portrays dead and with him stuck in a role that he does not want or really understand. The film thus greatly touches upon the nature of and meaning in human existence in a way that really is not obvious at least until the very end.Rod Steiger and James Coburn really help bring out this strong character exploration and emotion. Both are at their very best in this film imbuing their characters with great life and making them utterly compelling.Duck You Sucker also has Leone's trademark artistic directing and cinematography. It is not chock full of the incredible scenes and images the way the two immediately prior films are but one only need see a few scenes to know who made it. The opening is typical Leone in that it shows something strange and in a way that does not immediately tell the viewer what is actually going on drawing the viewer in to find out what he or she is watching. The scene in the coach with the emphasis on the people eating is also very effective.The music is as usual for a LeoneMorricone collaboration great and highly effective. It's even more unusual than the music in the Dollars films and I think some find it odd or unsettling but it is highly effective.".

The part of the bandit Juan Miranda was originally written for Eli Wallach and I feel he would have played the part to perfection. Eli Wallach is a great actor as his performance in Il buono il brutto il cattivo 1966 proves. He has that necessary charm and charisma essential for the character of Juan Miranda. United Artists executives forced Rod Steiger on Leone and the Director succumbed to their pressure. The mistake of not going with Leone's original intention of Eli Wallach soon became evident as tensions grew between Steiger and the Director. Steiger has no charm as an actor and as a result we have no sympathy for the character of Juan Miranda. Steiger also has a habit of letting you see his craft rather than simply being the part. Examples of his tendency to overplay or ham it up can be seen in Run of the Arrow 1957 Al Capone 1959 and Waterloo 1969. Sergio Leone came to realise but too late that Steiger was completely wrong for the part. This unfortunate piece of casting ruined the film before a camera had even turned.Steiger's Mexican accent is a problem because it is so false. Another fault is with the Irish accent by James Coburn. At points it is so hard to understand what he is saying because his diction is so bad yet Coburn does have charm and commands the screen. Yet there is very little chemistry between the actors when compared with Eastwood and Wallach in Il buono il brutto il cattivo.The movie does feel disjointed which is strange because most of Leone's other films seem to flow with a majestic quality. The absence of Carlo Simi as production designer is also evident. So as a result what is left is a film that could have been an undisputed classic but clearly is not. However great a Director may be it is the hardest thing to save a film from a poor piece of casting. It is still an entertaining film with some wonderful moments yet it could have been so much better with Eli Wallach as Juan Miranda. The DVD extras are very good documentaries and commentary all dominated by Christopher Frayling.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen quite a number of Sergio Leone's films by now and I must say that I found this one to be the worst yet. I admit that I've seen worse films in general but in no way can I recommend this one to you. If you want to see good Leone catch one of his films from The Man With No Name Trilogy or maybe even Once upon a Time in the West. I found the latter to be quite disappointing to be honest but it was still better than A Fistful of Dynamite. There is almost no excitement no coolness and the west is somehow robbed of it's roughness and interesting nature by motorized vehicles. Now I know that this is not supposed to be a film about gunslingers but one about revolution and even in that aspect the film fails. First of all the four flashbacks which are supposed to give the film more depth are misplaced with the exception of the last two. They do not add anything to the film or the preceding events and only make sense when or if you watch the movie until the end. Secondly the film is just too long and not exciting enough to make you want to see the whole 158 minutes of it. Thirdly I found it a bit strange that Coburn's Irish accent is apparent at one time and absent the next. Fourthly and maybe most sadly the music of Ennio Morricone did not as in many other movies add anything to the experience except maybe that it showed that the film is of mediocre quality in each end every aspect. No wonder scores from this film are likely to miss on any of Morricone's Best of records. Last but not least I felt that as the film went on or better dragged on twists occur that made absolutely no sense to me. Concluding this comment I must say that this is a film I could have easily left off my list but Leone is just too catchy a name for me. This one tumbles into oblivion rapidly after seeing and is not likely to be seen on any list not even biggest disappointments. Films that have more famous names though perhaps got better ratings by me will have places on that list like Once upon a time in the West 6 out of 10. The verdict for this one5 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "This Sergio Leone film is definitely the least seen of all his westerns. For some reason this film is largely forgotten. It is never shown on cable and the video was out of print for many years but has recently been rereleased on both laser disc and video. Hopefully now that it has been rereleased it will start getting the attention it deserves.This movie is the exception to the rule that Leone gets better with time but it is only a slight exception. After all it's hard to beat Once Upon a Time in the West. Perhaps the slight imperfections comes because it was not originally a Leone project and so he did not have quite as much control as usual.This film despite its name is not a spaghetti western. It is what is called a Zapata Western after the famous Mexican revolutionary. These films are characterized by the simultaneously friendly and antagonistic relationship between a local bandit  and a foreigner who is an expert at revolution. In A Fistful of Dynamite  Juan Miranda Ron Steiger is a Mexican bandit who runs across Sean Mallory James Coburn who is an IRA terrorist on the run. After some initial hostility and a few explosions Juan convinces Sean to rob the Bank of Mesa Verde. Sean however arranges things so that Juan frees hundreds of political prisoners while looking for the safe in the bank.

Quemada!  also known as Burn! which stars Marlon Brando is the story of a British officer Brando who helps start a revolution in the Antilles sugar farms by duping the soontobe leader of the slaves to rob a bank then defend himself and then defend his people.One of the interesting things about A Fistful of Dynamite is the weird offbeat yet beautiful Ennio Morricone score. From the Main Title's refrain of Sean. Sean Sean Sean. Sean Sean. to the March of the Beggars Juan's Theme croaking wop. Wop. wop. Morricone created something different than the usual spaghetti western yet just as fun and certainly just as moving.The music is well suited to the equally quirky direction by Leone. This movie is full of fast zooms extreme closeups exaggerated cartoonish visuals and sounds. A good example is the scene in which Juan is traveling with the upperclass snobs who proceed to stuff their faces with all sorts of food which Leone shows in extreme closeups and make fun of Juan and the poor Mexicans like him. The same phrases are repeated over and over faster and faster until the train is finally stopped by Juan's men. And one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Sean first reveals his incredible array of explosives and the camera zooms to Juan's amazed eyes.. the organ music swells and we see Sean standing there with a banner floating above him which reads Banco National de Mesa Verde. It's one of those things that Leone does that reveals exactly what a character is feeling even though nothing has been said. And of course a banner floating in midair above someone is just never done in movies. When Leone does it it is surprising and hilarious.A Fistful of Dynamite is a film unique in the Leone body of work. It is a comic film yet serious at the same time. Even though Juan is the comic character in this film the comic character is every bit as important as the serious one John as opposed to The Good the Bad and the Ugly or Once Upon a Time in the West . It is Juan that we see develop ideals while at the same time Sean loses his When I started using dynamite I used to believe in a lot of things. All of it! Now I believe only in dynamite. In elevating the comic character to the equal of the serious one Leone creates a film that is sensitive as it is cartoonish . What about me? we hear Juan ask at the end of the film. After these sad parting words that Juan realizes that now he must fight by himself thus losing his comic sidekick quality and becoming a serious Johntype character. This is the only time that such a switch happens in Leone's oeuvre and I'm glad it does".

	onyx:emotionText "This Sergio Leone film is definitely the least seen of all his westerns. For some reason this film is largely forgotten. It is never shown on cable and the video was out of print for many years but has recently been rereleased on both laser disc and video. Hopefully now that it has been rereleased it will start getting the attention it deserves.This movie is the exception to the rule that Leone gets better with time but it is only a slight exception. After all it's hard to beat Once Upon a Time in the West. Perhaps the slight imperfections comes because it was not originally a Leone project and so he did not have quite as much control as usual.This film despite its name is not a spaghetti western. It is what is called a Zapata Western after the famous Mexican revolutionary. These films are characterized by the simultaneously friendly and antagonistic relationship between a local bandit  and a foreigner who is an expert at revolution. In A Fistful of Dynamite  Juan Miranda Ron Steiger is a Mexican bandit who runs across Sean Mallory James Coburn who is an IRA terrorist on the run. After some initial hostility and a few explosions Juan convinces Sean to rob the Bank of Mesa Verde. Sean however arranges things so that Juan frees hundreds of political prisoners while looking for the safe in the bank. After that Juan slowly turns into a full fledged revolutionary while Sean loses his revolutionary fervor.To contrast this plot with a few other Zapata Westerns in The Mercenary a Mexican who starts to get involved in the revolution is helped by a clever mercenary who treats himself to the Mexican's water women and gold.

But gentlemen please why get involved with such dribble if not for a big pay cheque and a false belief that a Sergio Leone film has to be a five star film? The film is way too long with far too many scenes drawn out with close ups and that terrible terrible oh so terrible music score sha shong...sha shong...sha shong...sha shong.I love a good western and I can even tolerate a slow western but this piece of Mr. Leone's body of work needed at least a 3040 percent cut left on the editing floor.

	schema:headline " The Lucas and Leone effect";
	schema:reviewBody "With the first Star Wars trilogy creator George Lucas borrowed from Leone Kurosawa Ford Tolkien etc and created one of the best slices of pop art a bouncy myth at once futuristic medieval and topical  ie Vietnam which resembled the kind of postmodern comic book that the Kill Bill movies would beat like a dead horse decades later.Fast forward some years and Lucas decides to revisit the universe of Star Wars. He wants to create a prequel trilogy. Problem is he's a different guy now. He's grown and matured. End result he decides to give us a Greek Tragedy rather than a Hero's Journey. The heavy darker side of the myth.And so the Talibanlike rebels of the first trilogy are replaced and contrasted by showing us the evil workings of the American Empire. And yes the prequels are overtly antiAmerican. In this context we can almost read the destruction of the Death Star as a 911 event.George Bush I mean Senator Palpatine comes into power assumes executive control and promptly wipes out the Jedi who are stand ins for America's exoticized enemies. The democratic Old Republic then gradually dissolves into a far reaching Imperial state whilst the beauty of their spaceships the artistry of their cruisers and the elegant designs of their cities as shown in the prequels is slowly replaced with the cold bland mechanical or bureaucratic look of the Empire originals. Free thought and individuality is then removed clonesstormtroopers and the Imperial Empire is born.Note also how the logical scientific approach to the Force medichlorians  a play on the word mitochondria present in the Old Republic gives way to the mythical religions and rationalisations of the Force in the originals. The Prequels are the age of Reason populated by thinkers scientists and agnostics. But when society crumbles the age of mystics of hope and religion is reborn.How does something founded on beautiful ideals The Old RepublicAmerica become so evil? Lucas hits the nail on the head throughout the prequels. Politicians and people ignoring the plight of small nations and species. Large Trade Guilds exploiting and bullying the weak notice that the enemy is merely a conglomerate of superbusinesses traders and corporate monopolies. Power is centralised. The media is blacked out or fed lies. Arms deals are conducted in proxy Afghanistan Lebanon Vietnam Iraq are all proxy wars and everyone not of your religion Lucas' Empire is comprised of stuck up Brits is swept aside.Today the American Empire has military bases in virtually every country in the world. No other country has this privilege. It also has the CIA not only a body which is completely unchallenged and unanswerable to anyone but the President but one which has become quite adept at instigating coups and installing puppet leaders in foreign countries.Anyway despite all the interesting thematic stuff present in the prequels they're all hokey failures. Lucas fell into the trap that a lot of authors fall into. Authors often develop a series of books which become successful and connect with an audience. But great artists don't like to repeat themselves. So as the author progresses and grows as an artist the tone and content of his series changes. Eventually the reader no longer identifies with or likes the way the characters or author's voice has changed. Audiences want familiarity. Artists want to experiment to challenge perceptions...but they love their fanbase too. So in an attempt to win back the reader the author then reverts back to his simple minded fun storytelling while subversively inserting intelligence into the thing. The result is a strange mix which again doesn't go down well with the reader.Because of his financial success with the originals Lucas is one of the few directors to have a series of his own. His evolution as an artist is exactly as described as above. His prequels are an odd mix of old George and New George of adult smarts and teen fun.Of course the second problem is that an adventure serial just can't hold the weighty themes and Greek myth overtones that he wants to insert. The prequels had to be far darker like the Godfather trilogy in both tone and style less roller coaster and kiddie oriented for his story to work dramatically. My point with all of this is that Sergio Leone went through the same artistic evolution. He started out making a group of fun cartoonish pop westerns and then transcended the genre with his masterpiece The Good The Bad and The Ugly. But no one took him seriously. No one would finance his serious projects. So throughout the rest of his career he gives us overlong somber pictures which try to be both fun and light while also being political Marxist historical and important. This results in a weird cocktail of flawed movies peppered with greatness. Of movies at once childish but longing for an adult sensibility.It's also interesting to compare Leone to John Ford. Ford's action westerns became dated and stupid the moment Leone started his Dollars trilogy. Leone then went on to emulate Ford with Once Upon a time in the West a melancholic pastiche of countless other westerns which uncomfortably jumps from somber meditation to comic book spaghetti. Meanwhile Ford had dropped the action western and started making meaningful subversive westerns Liberty Valance of his own.810 A masterpiece with a bit of an identity crisis. It has it's flaws but I'd argue I can't due to IMDb word limits that it's better than both Once Upon A Time In America and Once Upon A Time In The West both of which are suffused with nostalgia yearning for the tropes and images of the western and gangster movies of Leone's childhood. They're Tarantino territory films about films.".

He turned it from being yet another Zapata western see Quien Sabe? Il Mercenario and Companeros into a statement against the genre.The intended message of Duck You Sucker is in short an evenhanded condemnation of the left and the right the moral of the story being that it's best not to get involved and that the home and the family are what matters most. A rather dubious philosophy when taken to such extremes but a real tonic when you look at how preachy some of those Zapata westerns were. Personally though I'm more drawn in by the delicate humanism that was maturing with Leone's work. There were occasional emotional moments in his earlier films but now Leone is really giving them time and complexity. Take for example the scene where Juan and John discuss the realities of the revolution at the camp  you can really believe in these characters.Like his final film Once Upon a Time in America this one can be seen as almost being a love story between two men. Not in a literal sense of course  it's not homoerotic  but in the way it's structured. Juan and John are opposites thrown together by fate are antagonistic towards each other at first but somehow a bond develops between them and they become inseparable. There's also the back story with Sean the other man in the Ireland flashbacks with whom John obviously had a similar relationship.As far as his technical style goes this is actually one of Leone's most perfectly constructed films. The editing is all spot on and incredibly rhythmic. Although it's a lot subtler than in the dollars westerns watch closely and you'll see he still choreographs the opening credits in time with music. Duck You Sucker is one of the best examples of what Michael Powell calls a composed film  that is one in which every aspect of the image  movement editing and even the colours and arrangement of objects and people  responds to the music are the collage of sounds. Powell himself was one of the best directors of composed films Robert Wise was another and so was Leone.A brilliant example of this compositional style and one of my favourite moments in all cinema is when Juan realises John's potential as a dynamiter and the Mesa Verde bank logo appears above his head just as Morricone's music references Bach's Toccata. A lot of people really hate that bit. Yes it's completely overthetop almost cartoonish but this is really Leone saying Hey this is cinema we don't need rules! Having said that there is one sequence along these lines which I dislike and that is when the bourgeois travellers are demonising the peasants whilst stuffing their faces and we see all these closeups of their mouths and hear the same words repeated over and over. It's such an obvious boring device and not really very effective.A big weakness with Duck You Sucker is that being caught between the old and new Leone styles sometimes it doesn't really know what sort of film it wants to be. Leone's westerns for better or for worse stuck to the formula of a hero and a villain pitted against each other from the start destined to meet in a final showdown. As his films progressed he concentrated more on social drama and character development and Duck You Sucker certainly continues this trend. However it is still tied to the old tradition and consequently has a few token villains  but the nazilike army officer Ruiz and the governor whose face is on all the posters while they are necessary background figures don't really belong as characters. The drama in Duck You Sucker is fully formed  Leone had fully developed the humanistic element in his films by now  but at the expense of making the action elements feel tacked on. Also despite the picture being in part a statement against political violence the action scenes are still done in an exciting heroic fashion.An awkward Leone picture to pigeon hole but still a very enjoyable one. It's the closest he came to making a message film even if it is the ultimate political antistatement. It has its flaws but it looks great and has a brilliant pace to it. Both Rod Steiger and James Coburn have been criticised in the lead roles but I think they're both perfectly cast. Considering the circumstances in which it came about Duck You Sucker isn't half bad.".

His faith in God severely tested during one memorable scene in the cave hideout where his family have been massacred through betrayal of a friend.Coburn's performance comes a close second. He is like a middle class intellectual compared to Steiger's working class hero and yet they both seem to depend on each other.Leone has this wonderful talent with character development and how he can pull at our heart strings as our heroes suffer the kind of inhumanities they hand out to others.DYNAMITE lacks the style of WEST  AMERICA and the flashbacks are a little lumpen  crude. The settings also seem a little less grandiose  beguiling compared to the refined township world of Jill McBaine from WEST.The music from Morricone who else!? is a little more eclectic  scatty than his previous works for the first time he adds some random sound effects  chants which goes against the operatic style of the master.

	schema:reviewBody "Cookers was quite a movie. When I made my first attempt to watch it I was expecting to see a simple story about drug addicts fighting off evil spirits much like any other low budget haunted house horror flick that we've all seen before but with an interesting twist in that the main characters were speed freaks. After watching about thirty minutes I had to shut it off to take a break. With only three characters and an empty house in the woods Cookers manages to create such a tense and unsettling atmosphere that I found it to be almost unbearable at times.The story could indeed be viewed as a simple one as we see a young couple Hector and Dorena who are on the run with a crystal meth lab in their van and are looking for a place to set up shop for a while to lay low. With the help of Hector's buddy Merle they find a secluded house that has been abandoned on the outskirts of town and make it their temporary home. Dorena is a cooker who specializes in actually making the crystal meth so that it can be sold on the street. Hector's specialty is doing crystal meth so they are a good couple. Things get spooky and strange very quickly after Hector and Dorena get high as the house may not be completely empty after all... Are they seeing ghosts or just hallucinating? And will Merle eventually betray them to cash in on the deal himself? Brad Hunt plays Hector and he deserves much credit for holding this flick together. His acting in Cookers is award worthy. I don't remember ever seeing a junkie portrayed with such realism. Cyia Batten as Dorena was also impressive. The two of them worked very well together. Even Patrick McGaw was believable as Merle who provided brief moments of comic relief and added a muchneeded element to the film. All three actors delivered the goods and were always interesting to watch.Cookers also succeeds in the writing and directing department. Although it doesn't have a big budget the few special effects that we do see are suited to the shooting style of the film and never distract from the overall sense of what's real and what's not that keeps you guessing until the end. But this movie is not about building to a big twist or tricking its viewer. It is about drawing you into a bleak world of fear and hopelessness and director Dan Mintz does an admirable job in capturing these emotions on film. Jack Moore and Jeff Ritchie wrote the script and it is fresh with gritty realism and excellent dialog. Merle tells a bizarre story one night as the three of them are getting stoned and it is truly chilling. Dorena also tells a story to Hector about her past and it was heart wrenching.Cookers is not a film for everyone nor do I think that I will ever watch it again. It is a movie that I will always remember and one that I am very glad that I saw. Although the ending is somewhat weak it is a relentless and riveting story that will appeal to those with an open mind who are in the mood for something different.".

Creepy and compelling the film builds in tension with every frame and surrounds you with a constant feeling of dread. You just know something bad is going to happen you just don't know when. Helped along by decent acting and some very clever audio design there are a couple of scenes that should make your flesh crawl a few that will surprise you and some that will make you say wait...was that reality or a hallucination?

It forces us to think and analyze or interpret. No cliffnotes here it is up to you to decide for yourself what the film means what is happening how it affects you. The acting was superb. Each character clearly defined and sussedout. Brad Hunt gave a strong performance if at times slightly exaggerated. Cyia Batten's performance was impressive gutwrenchingly touching and extraordinarily brave particularly being the only female to have to stand against two very powerful men. Patrick McGaw was unrecognizable and fantastic funny and tragic all at once. In my opinion awards should be doled out here to each one of them for what they brought to the table but if I had to pick just one I would have to pick Cyia Batten who plays the heartbreaking Dorena. It is not easy to embody vulnerability and power at the same time and yet she appeared to do it with ease. The editing can be dizzying at times fast paced and overstimulating but it fit perfectly considering the nature of the demons these characters fought. It almost got you into their heads for a time. Overall I was moved scared saddened angered overwhelmed by this movie. I couldnt get it out of my head for a long time. I hope this movie does well because everybody should see the raw brutal truth of drug addiction annd losing oneself to their own private demons.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cookers is a tidy lowbudget number an excellent foray into the world of Meth addiction. Two cookers Dorena and Hector disappear into the wilderness with the idea to cook up a batch of highgrade meth sell it at a huge price and spend the rest of their lives on permanent vacation. The problem is the cookers can't keep their fingers  and noses  out of the goods. As they continue to cook they continue to use staying up for days at a time. Paranoia hallucinations and petty squabbles ensue. The story pretty much demands that you buy into their addiction otherwise it's just going to fall apart. Brad Hunt's performance as the constantlytweaking Hector really sells the entire movie his twitching nervous Methfueled paranoia realistically portrayed.There are a few minor problems however. Dorena's backstory is a little shall we say TYPICAL which is kind of odd considering how well the script is otherwise. Also the film tends to lose steam as it reaches its ultimate conclusion as if the writer couldn't think of an appropriate way to end the film. I will note however that Hector's demise is horrifying especially considering his stateofmind at the time. And other than a few poorlyexecuted special effects sequences  which could have easily been replaced with more of that bumpinthenight suspense the film relies on most of the time  there's really nothing to complain about technically speaking. The film looks great despite its limited budget though you can't go in expecting this to look like a slick Hollywood production. No the film wears its budget on its sleeve something you'll have to overlook if this type of thing is a problem for you. Let me put it this way If you dug Session 9 then Cookers shouldn't be a problem.The guy at the video store gave me a headsup in terms of what to expect and I'll repeat it here It's basically just three actors one camera and one house. I think the Blair Witch Project had a bigger budget though it works on the same level. If that doesn't tell you what you're in for then I don't know what else to do for you.Cookers could have fumbled the ball especially considering its subject matter. But instead of using stereotypical images situations and characters to dress a bythenumbers horror film the director has chosen to insert these tragic figures in the middle of a realistic situation something a lot of Internet reviewers seem to have a problem with. Though the following statement may give away a bit too much I'm of the belief that the things in my head are far more terrifying than anything in the real world supernatural or not. Was I expecting a big payoff? Not really. The film ended as it should I think with the viewer coming down from a serious mindfck and stepping into the sunlight for the first time in days. My hats off to everyone involved. Fine work indeed.Cookers is a little flawed but highly recommended. Keep in mind however that it's not strictly a horror movie. Horrifying yes. Horror no.But don't let that stop you from seeing it.".

I was expecting a really cheezy SOV borefest but instead got a pretty damn solid mix of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM meets THE AMITYVILLE HORROR that pretty much works on all levels. For a relatively nobudget unknown film  COOKERS surprised and impressed me...Hector and Dorena are a couple of whitetrash methheads who are running from some thugs that they ripped off. They hole up in an abandoned house to set up a lab to cook up a whole rack o' crank. Hector's dimwitted pal Merle joins the fun to help out  and a good bit of the film is watching Hector and Dorena smoke snort and slam about 400 ounces of meth while Merle drinks beer and smokes a bit himself. Eventually we find that the house is haunted  add to this the increasing paranoia as Hector and Dorena's drug use escalate to ridiculous proportions  and you have a pretty tense horror film that'll make you wish you had an 8ball handy...Seriously though  there are a lot of plussides to this film. The performances by the three leads are all strong and believable. The actor's who played Hector and Dorena were either addicts at one time or REALLY did their homework  they were spoton as a couple of skeezed out speedfreaks. Their performances rival any other actor playing the role of an addict that I've ever seen. The storyline was interesting and the mounting sense of tension was well handled. The only gripes I have were that there were a few cheezy CGI scenes that were ineffective an actually brought the realism of the situations down a notch and there were a few spots that tended to drag a little bit  but COOKERS is the type of film where the good aspects definitely outweigh the bad. The ending was also downbeat and dark and I dug that a lot too. I'd definitely recommend this one to anyone lookin' for a haunted house story with a twist and a strong message  Don't do a bunch of crank in a haunted house...I got that message loud and clear...8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Girlfriend comments1 I had no idea it was this exciting!2 Did you know there was this much suspense? 3 I love this movie. 4 This is so rad!People afraid of horror movies but like offbeat or indie films should not overlook this title. This is actually not a horror movie at all. It's more like a suspenseful drug movie with supernatural overtones. There are no serial killers or monsters and the filmmakers are uninterested in doing things many more accomplished filmmakers might do if they were to make a horror movie  like inserting a pointless murder or similar scene of carnage just to keep things interesting. Cookers is one of those kinds of movies that seems like it should have been a play or possibly was adapted from the stage. The dialogue is great fun with sinister and paranoid ramblings scattered throughout. The cast is very strong and seems quite comfortable with the dark material. Each of them is given a specific character arc that we get to watch them travel on and there are some nice payoffs for each of them. The story definitely plays second fiddle to the creepy ambiance. This movie is all about the enclosure of these unpredictable characters in a claustrophobic dilapidated setting. The dusty and abandoned old house is perfect. The production designer did some superb work on the interiorit's reminiscent of the wildly confusing layout of the house in Evil Dead 2. The music is perfectit isn't manipulative or inappropriate and has a studiolevel quality that is very satisfying. Another strength of the film is how effective and consistent the quality of light is throughout it never seems like there shouldn't be as much as there is or that there is too little of it for all the sources present. The overall look of the film falls somewhere between video and celluloid not quite cheap but not glossy at all. 35mm might have been a more appropriate format but it looks fine in standard. The sound however leaves much to be desired. At times it is extraordinary but at other times dialogue levels are either disproportionate or completely inaudible. One of the most glaring weaknesses of the DVD is the lack of captions. For an indie effort that's saying somethingusually there are either major continuity errors logic blips pathetic actors andor a lack of understanding of tone story momentum showing not telling etc. The fact that this movie contains no real noticeable hiccups like these is quite extraordinary and the creators should be proud of their work.".

	onyx:emotionText "Girlfriend comments1 I had no idea it was this exciting!2 Did you know there was this much suspense? 3 I love this movie. 4 This is so rad!People afraid of horror movies but like offbeat or indie films should not overlook this title. This is actually not a horror movie at all. It's more like a suspenseful drug movie with supernatural overtones. There are no serial killers or monsters and the filmmakers are uninterested in doing things many more accomplished filmmakers might do if they were to make a horror movie  like inserting a pointless murder or similar scene of carnage just to keep things interesting. Cookers is one of those kinds of movies that seems like it should have been a play or possibly was adapted from the stage. The dialogue is great fun with sinister and paranoid ramblings scattered throughout. The cast is very strong and seems quite comfortable with the dark material. Each of them is given a specific character arc that we get to watch them travel on and there are some nice payoffs for each of them. The story definitely plays second fiddle to the creepy ambiance. This movie is all about the enclosure of these unpredictable characters in a claustrophobic dilapidated setting. The dusty and abandoned old house is perfect. The production designer did some superb work on the interiorit's reminiscent of the wildly confusing layout of the house in Evil Dead 2. The music is perfectit isn't manipulative or inappropriate and has a studiolevel quality that is very satisfying.

He also offers some effective jump scares but it's the oppressive claustrophobic atmosphere which makes this surprisingly strong horror film stand out for me.

They pick up the dregs of societyprostitutes homeless hitchhikers etcand take them back to their isolated villa with its weird crimsoncolored bloodstained lawn. They feed them drinks and weird drugs and engage them in wild orgies before hooking them to a strange machine which drains all the blood from their bodieswhich they then package and sell in wine bottles! This is an genuinely creepy movie. I know little or nothing about the director Riccardo Ghionne but he definitely does a pretty effective job here. Enzo Tarascio who plays the husband is very creepy looking especially during the orgy scene where he wears a bizarre oversized blue bow tie which like the red lawn is a very offkilter and disturbing image. His hardasnails wife is excellently played by Marina Malfatti who was in a number of Italian gialli usually as the second banana to more famous actresses like Edwige Fenech Barbara Bouchet or Erica Blanc. This is is one of her few leading roles and undoubtedly her best. The victims as per usual are a pretty hapless lot. Dominique Broschero plays a prostituteshe was a pretty prolific actress during this period but I'm not very familiar with her previous work. The busty Barbara Marzano plays a female hitchhiker. She mostly did numerous usually topless cameos in movies like Torso but her most famous role was probably in Ferdinand DiLeo's The Seduction where she played the sexually curious best friend of the teenage daughter of the girlfriend of the male protagonist who he cheats on the teenage daughter with AFTER he cheats on his girlfriend with her daughter! Naturally she's pretty desirable.The statement this movie makes about the bottomless appetites of the Italian upper classes and the mindless pleasureseeking of the lowers classes and the aimless youth is pretty blunt and obvious but effective nevertheless. I was lucky enough to see this obscure but very rewarding movie with English subtitles but the dialogue is probably the least interesting thing about it. Definitely recommended.".

	schema:headline " The lighter side of a very real '70s concern";
	schema:reviewBody "Riccardo Ghione's amusing and selfaware black comedy takes a rather wry look at a very real concern in the early 1970sAlvin Toffler's Future Shock was required reading on college campuses back in 1972 and the alarmist book about the future and the shock that its arrival brings was only a forerunner of the fears the Me Decade grappled with especially on screen with nightmarish fare like WESTWORLD and DEATHRACE 2000. Two other 1973 cautionary tales SOYLENT GREEN and TRAITMENT DE CHOC also envisioned a cannibalistic future but THE BLOODSTAINED LAWN the third in this futuristic triptych goes where no man has gone before by making light of the rampant paranoia.Amoral aristocrat Nina Genovese Marina Malfatti who looks a bit like Sharon Tate her mad scientist husband who looks a lot like Soupy Sales right down to the big bow ties and the brother she's in love with bring a drunk a hooker a gypsy and a pair of hippies back to their ultramodern estate for some dope orgies and music but soon the guests disappear one by one to become the secret ingredient of a rejuvenating wine the depraved trio bottle and sell.

	onyx:emotionText "Riccardo Ghione's amusing and selfaware black comedy takes a rather wry look at a very real concern in the early 1970sAlvin Toffler's Future Shock was required reading on college campuses back in 1972 and the alarmist book about the future and the shock that its arrival brings was only a forerunner of the fears the Me Decade grappled with especially on screen with nightmarish fare like WESTWORLD and DEATHRACE 2000. Two other 1973 cautionary tales SOYLENT GREEN and TRAITMENT DE CHOC also envisioned a cannibalistic future but THE BLOODSTAINED LAWN the third in this futuristic triptych goes where no man has gone before by making light of the rampant paranoia.Amoral aristocrat Nina Genovese Marina Malfatti who looks a bit like Sharon Tate her mad scientist husband who looks a lot like Soupy Sales right down to the big bow ties and the brother she's in love with bring a drunk a hooker a gypsy and a pair of hippies back to their ultramodern estate for some dope orgies and music but soon the guests disappear one by one to become the secret ingredient of a rejuvenating wine the depraved trio bottle and sell.

It's basically about a group of rich decadent people who pick up various less fortunate people and take them to their remote luxury villa. The aristocrats entertain this assortment of poor people with a wild orgy and plenty of other sensual pleasures. There is a catch of course. And that catch is that these poor fools are to have all their blood drained from their bodies via a strange machine built by the resident scientist. Their blood is then sold in wine bottles for a tidy profit.The idea of the rich leeching off the poor is the social commentary. It adds an unusual dimension to what is a quite strange film to begin with. The blooddraining machine and the other bizarre devices in the house give the film a slight science fiction element which is not exactly typical for a film of this type. I wouldn't really go as far as to say that this is a particularly good film though. It's a bit meandering and unengaging a lot of the time. But as I say it does have its eccentricities and that is a plus point. It stars Marina Malfatti as the chief ice blonde. She starred in a number of gialli such as All the Colors of the Dark and The Red Queen Kills 7 Times. This film is definitely not up to the standard of those but at least Malfatti gets a more central role in this one.It's a bit different and it is a definite obscurity. But it's not essential though.".

That message comes across loud and clear.

He takes them back to his modern home where his sister Nina Marina Malfatti and her weird husband Antonio live. Antonio is an eccentric scientist obsessed with biological perfection who has all sort of crazy robots lying around the place.

The drunk guy seems to be the only one who realises that he's stumbled into some modern version of Hansel and Gretel only instead of being filled up with sweets and shoved in an oven the evil rich people give you what you want booze jewels etc then suck all the blood out of the back of your neck using a bizarre robot that looks like Metal Mickey has gone off the rails pretty badly. Eventually the captives are whittled down enough and the hippies come out of their smug stupor and finally cotton on that they are next.Meanwhile there's this agent trapped in a subplot throughout the film that initially finds some wine bottles containing blood who is trying to trace everything back to his source. He doesn't get to do much but I guess he turns up at the right time when needed. Most of the madness occurs inside the house however my favourite being when Antonio invites everyone who is still alive at that point to enter a weird hall of mirrors he's designed...if only they'll jump through the giant plastic fanny he's using as a doorway!This is the blackest of black comedy right here but there are the odd effective bits of horror too from the hippies finding a fridge full of dead bodies to the exsanguination of the prostitute.

One of the more engaging parts of this one is the fact that there's quite a lengthy and prolonged first half that really does a great job at building a chilling and creepy atmosphere. The scenes of the group securing the different people ranging from the different degenerates and hitchhikers in the various parts of town then bringing them back to their house under the guise of treating them well only to have the tables turned on them makes for a solid exploitation premise that features all the usual sleaze and nudity usually found there yet subtly instituting clues that something's not quite right along the way. From the couple's odd habits finding the nude woman tied up in the bedroom and the psychedelic soundtrack playing over the orgy in the hall of mirrors there's enough weirdness going on that it really makes for an appropriate setup already so that once it turns around in the second half it's gradual induction of their strange machines kept hidden away really turns this one into quite the chilling effort. Once there the raging thunderstorm and the reveal of their trap gives this a nice air that's magnified by the actual draining procedure conducted by the robot which is quite a surreal sight. There's quite a lot to really enjoy here with these elements though there's a few minor problems with this one. The biggest issue is undoubtedly the confusing investigation going on alongside this one as it is so lazily shoehorned into the proceedings that it's quite obvious an afterthought by the short quickcut inserts they are placed into the film and interrupt the sleaze and exploitation in the remaining parts of the film. Likewise this also tends to cause the film to stutter along with quite a rather plodding pace during this section and really keeps the film from unleashing it's full gimmick until quite late in here which is due to the rather unnecessary inclusion here.

In fact this is a very German movie which is slightly based on Father Brown storiesIf you see this film without regard of the periodplace it was made you might find the storyline and acting terrible backdated. However this movie fits perfectly in the German 60's era of somewhat fuzzy detective thrillers after stories of Edgar Alan Poe and other English writers. For that era I find Das schwarze Schaf and also the second father brown movie Er kann's nicht lassen better than average.The feeling of those movies and especially the both Father Brown films rely very much on the bigband jazz sound of Martin Boettcher who was regularly asked to compose soundtracks during that period later Boettcher would compose the famous Winnetou soundtracks.As conclusion Do not watch this movie if you want to see the Father Brown of the stories. Do not watch it if you hate backdated films. For all others it is an old but nice movie typically for it's era.".

For that era I find Das schwarze Schaf and also the second father brown movie Er kann's nicht lassen better than average.The feeling of those movies and especially the both Father Brown films rely very much on the bigband jazz sound of Martin Boettcher who was regularly asked to compose soundtracks during that period later Boettcher would compose the famous Winnetou soundtracks.As conclusion Do not watch this movie if you want to see the Father Brown of the stories. Do not watch it if you hate backdated films. For all others it is an old but nice movie typically for it's era.";

Emphasis in this adaptation is very much on Father Brown himself rather than on a good detective story.

	schema:reviewBody "Das schwarze Schaf or The Black Sheep is a West German blackandwhite movie from over 55 years ago. The star here is lead actor Heinz Rhmann and he also won a German Film Award for playing the main character here a priest who keeps solving murder crimes. It runs for 90 minutes and is 90 crime story in my opinion. This is not a good thing as the plot twists and the story in general are just not good enough and not even Rhmann can make it work. I personally think Rhmann delivered his best during the years when this was made but here the comedy is very limited and he cannot shine in that era as he usually does. Instead the film has a touch of Edgar Wallace attached to it but is equally disappointing as most of the Wallace adaptations.This film here runs for 90 minutes exactly pretty much and its success resulted in a second film being made. Apart from that Father Brown is a character who has appeared many times in films and especially series in the last decades. German audiences may know Ottfried Fischer's take on the story. But back to this one here. In order to let me recommend it the crimerelated stories should have been much better. I also did not like how basically everybody in this film were displayed as fools in order to make Rhmann's character look good and I personally did not like how Brown seemed fairly arrogant at times. This film lacks what made Adelheid und ihre Mrder for example a good watch. It just takes itself way too seriously and the solid solution and revelation about the murder at the end cannot make up for it either. I give this film a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

The director Nacho Vigalondo told us this was his world premiere and he was very nervous giving his introduction. After about 90 minutes I realized my second movie at Fantastic Fest 2007 may be the best one I see all week. Timecrimes was an engaging movie that is easy to follow despite it's complex plot. I would hate to give away even the smallest of details the title says everything you need to know. Even though I felt like I was in the driver's seat the whole movie there were still surprises throughout that kept things interesting until the closing credits. The journey taken by Hector Karra Elejalde develops his character beautifully and he is complimented by a small and effective cast. It would be a crime if this movie doesn't get the distribution it deserves. The QA afterward revealed some interesting behind the scenes stories and some info that made me want to see the movie again. Fortunately the buzz from our half full screening was enough to sell out the second screening at the festival. The film won Best Picture at Fantastic Fest 2007 was the Silver Medal winner for Audience Favorite and was the highest rated film at the festival. If you get a chance to see this movie DO IT!!UPDATE Timecrimes has been picked up by Magnolia Pictures.".

There are not really any plot holes except that main character acts somewhat in fear of not ruining what he knows happens at least at first which is somewhat dubious but the consistency is preserved. What would happen if he tried to subvert it is not explored but still a solid work and an unexplored angle.

There are not really any plot holes except that main character acts somewhat in fear of not ruining what he knows happens at least at first which is somewhat dubious but the consistency is preserved. What would happen if he tried to subvert it is not explored but still a solid work and an unexplored angle. Less ambitious than Predestination and at a lower budget but delivers similar experience if in more low key way which is sometimes sweeter in a way small but clever films can be.";

	schema:headline " Timecrimes is lazy with characters that act outside of any common sense";
	schema:reviewBody "Timecrimes is the type of film that relies purely on its concept much in the same way as The Human Centipede. The problem with that is the concept becomes a crutch. This review will contain spoilers but unless you have seen the film the spoilers will probably make little sense anyway.The concept that I'm talking about is the idea of an illogical time travel paradox. To be more exact a predestination paradox. A predestination paradox is when a time traveler is caught in a loop of events that predestines or predates them to travel back in time.Hector 1 is caused to go back in time because of the actions of Hector 2. The only reason Hector 2 exists is because Hector 1 went back in time.Similarly Hector 3 exists only because of events Hector 3 puts in motion before Hector 2 even knows there is a Hector 3. It could be more accurate to say that Hector 2 decides to use the time machine to become Hector 3 once Hector 2 becomes aware that there is a Hector 3.It's actually not as complicated as it sounds and that is the entire plot of the movie summed up. Once the concept becomes apparent within the first 15 or 20 minutes of the film or so the rest of the film plods along in a very predictable fashion. We know the destination of the character because for him it has been predestined.The problem is that watching Hector go through events and then put events in motion again once he travels in time becomes a bore. The film takes place across a day the character only traveling back in time 90 minutes or so. Hector is an unlikeable character and his actions as the various versions of himself make no sense.To be more clear an example is when Hector 2 has wrapped bandages around his entire head making himself look like a maniac who then stabs and chases Hector 1 and forces a woman to undress. The motivations are completely unclear. The only reason Hector 2 does these things is because it predestines Hector 1 to go to the time travel machine in the first place. Hector 3's actions are similar in their lack of clarity and the only seeming motivation being to keep the predestination paradox intact. Maybe the writerdirector is trying to make a point about lack of free will. Personally I just think its lazy writing. You can't have a plot that revolves entirely around a predestination paradox and have characters that behave outside of any idea of logic or common sense. Otherwise what is the interest of the film? What is the draw? When the entire draw of a film is its concept rather than story and characters something was fundamentally wrong right from the script up to the filming.".

But then you quickly figure out what is going on and then elements of it become quite predictable! This was unfortunate in that the next half hour or so was really boring to watch because it was obvious how things would happen. It's after this initial predictable bit that things start to get more complex and the story also begins to fall apart.It really wouldn't make for an interesting read if I was to simply type out all the loose ends and random actions that the characters take in the film that seem to have no explanation at all. I will just say that it had even more inconsistencies than Primer  a film which Los Cronocrimenes is almost identical to. Primer was also a poor film out of the two I couldn't decide which was worse so I guess that means they were equally as bad.Now I'm quite sure I've upset a lot of people with my negative comments about this film so far. People always seem to get tetchy over negative reviews of films that for some reason they see as untouchable. Believe me I wanted dearly to like this film but I left very disappointed bored feeling I had just watched 'Primer 2' wandering why Hollywood have already bought the rights to make this film and more importantly wondering why so many good reviews when it is quite blatantly contrived predictable and full of loose ends!Hector the main character does so many unexplained things it leaves you feeling frustrated and as another reviewer has stated there are many moments of unbelievably in this movie that requires the audience to leave reason at the door on the way in. Although the other reviewer did state these moments were made acceptable via humour I did not find much humour in this movie myself.If a film maker is going to take on a time travel movie then they should at least have the integrity to make sure it all 'works'. However as usual all this seems to have been looked over by people who insist on giving this film a great review. There only seems to be a minority of people who are willing to point out that there are too many loose ends to make this film work. And if you have a time travel movie that doesn't work then what good is it?".

The ramifications from our computer restore are usually saving time and money from a time machine may come a chance to upset the balance of nature to throw ourselves into a primitive state of lawlessness.

	schema:headline " Time Travel Make Hector Dumb";
	schema:reviewBody "As far as i can tell this is a movie about the unwarranted humiliation and murder of beautiful Good Samaritan by a nervous horny simpleton because time travel makes you dumber. It is obvious from the very first scene where Hector accidentally dumps all of his home and garden purchases from his car as he drives up the driveway that he is not very bright. But on each consecutive trip into the time machine and through his day he becomes increasingly moronic sadistic and cruel. He repeats mistakes he's seen himself make and does nothing to fix any of the problems he has or knows are coming. The first Hector Hector 1 is forgivable for his blunders. He is simply lured into the woods by a beautiful naked woman and then attacked and chased my a masked maniac man who eventually frightens him enough to break into a building and then trap himself by climbing into a large vat filled with milk. He's not showing us that too many brain cells are working but at least his actions are plausibly understandable. It is his second journey through the evening as Hector 2 where his mental capacities apparently begin to break down. Here he ignores the advice of the time machine operatorscientist by first calling his house and then stealing a car and leaving the compound to go somewhere possibly to his house to make things worse when he sees the nice girl he saw naked riding her bike. After a quick car accident Hector 2 wraps his head in a bloody bandage turning himself into the masked maniac man and proceeds to degrade and humiliate the pretty young girl he saw naked after she stops to help him and gives him some water. Hector 2 then stabs Hector 1 with some scissors he stole from the pretty girl he saw naked and frightens him into running for his life setting the scene for his previous time travel. He then inexplicably breaks into his own house and accidentally murders a woman he thinks is his wife which results in his having to go back in time again to correct his mistake. But it is Hector 3 who is the real idiot. Not only does he allow all the horrible things that he did the last time and experienced the first time to happen again this time he knowingly lets the beautiful young girl he saw naked and was only trying to help be humiliated and then killed in place of his wife. He also steals another car breaks his fourth fence and destroys the nice coffee table he'd bought for his wife earlier in the day while he's locked her in the shed. And this is the Hector that is allowed to live. With all that being said I thought this was a very entertaining movie particularly for those who enjoy screaming at the screen when the characters do things we know are stupid. And as far at time travel movies go this film unquestionably picks fate over free will as it's driving point.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's really not that obvious for a young and still aspiring writerdirector to revolve his longfeature film debut on the hugely complex topic of time traveling as a failure could immediately affect your credibility as a director and maybe even ruin your further career before it properly started. True Nacho Vigalondo already received an Oscar nomination in 2005 for one of his short films so you know he must somehow be talented but still to take on subjects like paradoxes and time loops in your first film displays a lot of courage and ambition. But Vigalondo was right to feel confident as his script is intelligent engaging and not nearly as implausible as you'd expect from a SciFi film. When thinking of films about time traveling you promptly imagine there to be giant laboratories full of machinery with thousands of little buttons and colorful lights or maybe a DeLorean macho men in futuristic costumes and endless overlong speeches about scientific theories. The last things you expect to see are normal identifiable characters in their everyday environments and how they're suddenly and involuntarily involved in ScienceFictionesque situations. Timecrimes introduces Hctor a middle aged house father with a slight voyeuristic habit. When Hctor spots a naked girl in the woods through his binoculars he decides to look for her who wouldn't? but suddenly he finds himself chased by a madman with an uncanny bandage wrapped around his head and waving around a pair of scissors. Hctor finds shelter in a nearby lab and the technician advises him to hide in a peculiar device filled with liquid. The real problems only just begin when Hctor emerges again. Realizing he traveled back a few hours in time Hctor witnesses himself running through the woods and painfully also comes to realize who exactly he was running away from The plot grows increasingly convoluted with each minute but strangely enough the film always remains easy to follow and fastpaced. When the whole script is one giant paradox you also prepare to encounter a lot of plot holes and improbabilities but the film actually makes sense all the time. There's a more than fair amount of suspense beautiful photography and atmospheric musical guidance. Karra Elejalde is simply superb in his difficult and unconventional role as Hctor the antihero and Barbara Goenaga is  apart from a really great actress  a stunningly ravishing woman. Terrific film.".

	schema:reviewBody "While introducing the movie director Nacho Vigalondo said that he thought this was the first ever Spanish timetravel movie. More accurately this was the first Spanish biggerbudget variation of Sundance 2005's Primer.Hector appears to be living a happy and contented life in their new house with his pretty and affectionate wife Clara when one day he spies through his binoculars a woman in the woods in the act of undressing. When Clara leaves Hector goes off to investigate. And there the fun begins as Hector's quest thrusts him into an adventure that includes the discovery of a time machine and a dogged quest to unravel its effects.If you like mind game movies like Memento Proof or the even harder to follow Primer then Time Crimes will have some appeal. And while the movie does have some timetwisting inconsistencies it generally ties the loose ends into a knotty if not absurd conclusion. The story moves along briskly requiring intellectual energy to keep up and a forgiving attitude to a few ridiculous devices. Fortunately there is an occasional and welcome infusion of humor that makes some of the cheesier elements a little easier to swallow. But somehow the whole thing felt more like a Twilight Zone episode stretched into a featurelength film. Fortunately like most Twilight Zone episodes this one had a great ending. I just loved the final shot which is quaintly ironic although it will leave some viewers unsatisfied I am sure.Sundance Moment In the postmovie QA Vigalondo said that after shooting his film he realized what it really wasa love triangle story. My reaction was Huh? Did I watch the right movie?".

I just loved the final shot which is quaintly ironic although it will leave some viewers unsatisfied I am sure.Sundance Moment In the postmovie QA Vigalondo said that after shooting his film he realized what it really wasa love triangle story. My reaction was Huh? Did I watch the right movie?";

	schema:reviewBody "The wonderfully fresh and vivacious Jean Seberg here shines in her second film. The previous year she had played Joan of Arc chosen from 18000 young girls who auditioned for the role and here Otto Preminger directs his protg again to superb effect. The film opens with very dramatic music by Georges Auric. This film is based upon the bestselling first novel by the young Francoise Sagan which created a scandal then but now is not scandalous at all. What passed for 'decadence' at the time was a life of aimless idling by the rich on the Riviera some gambling some boating some swimming some affairs and a great deal of insipid selfindulgence. This we see epitomised in Seberg's father played to perfection by David Niven a shallow idler and womanizer who straightens his bow tie selfconsciously between seductions in the bushes. He and Jean have a 'fatheranddaughterthing' because her mother died long ago and they really don't want anybody else in their lives apart from casual partners with whom they can romp only to throw them away when used joking about them to each other as they get ready to have an evening out. As the film opens Niven's girlfriend of the moment is Elsa a charmingly emptyheaded creature played delightfully by Mylene Demongeot who shows such talent as a restrained comedienne. Juliette Greco makes a fullthroated appearance in a club singing the film's theme song all the way through as the dancing and whirling Jean stares at her glassyeyed over men's shoulders lost in haunted visions of regret. In 1958 the teenage girls of Britain all swooned over and identified with Jean Seberg who seems to have originated the shorn boyish haircut which Mia Farrow later copied. Niven as the amiable cad was pretty much what one would expect. But into this mix comes Miss Straight in the form of Deborah Kerr who says to Niven when he gets flirty 'I don't want to be casual.' That's for sure. When Niven finally decides he wants to marry her she becomes a Little Hitler in no time bossing Jean around stopping everyone having 'fun' and generally making herself odious with her controlfreakery. This leads to a campaign to drive her out by Jean and Elsa who has been unceremoniously dumped. Meanwhile Kerr has fallen hard and in a revealing shot in the harsh sun we even discover that her true complexion was rather gingery and freckly something concealed in her other films. Tragedy is not long in coming hence the 'tristesse'. This is a social document of the 1950s which people interested in knowing what things were once like should watch. The film is directed by a master Preminger and Jean Seberg 'makes it' entirely. She is so refreshing natural young real. Poor Jean Seberg. By the age of 40 she was dead. But she left much to remember her by no one who has seen 'Breathless' 1960 can ever forget her. This film too keeps her wonderful memory alive. Her best acting performance was probably in 'Lilith' but she does well enough here wholly dominating the screen and acting circles round the old pros. Oh yes and then there's the inside joke about Eveline Eyfel playing three identical sisters who act as the maid which is an amusing touch. The Mediterranean sparkles in the sunshine the pine trees along the beach are exuding their aroma swim suits dry in minutes come on in the water's fine!".

	schema:headline " Preminger in transition";
	schema:reviewBody "A fascinating frustrating though ultimately deeply satisfying film. Many readers have commented on the frustrations and they are hard to deny. My experience of this movie goes back to the early 70s when I first encountered it in ideal circumstances at the Museum of Modern Art during its complete Preminger retrospective and in a gorgeous perfect print. A great introduction to a film whose very meaning resides in its glossy surface. The first few minutes of the film powerfully set up the tragedy that is to come Saul Bass's dripping teardrop titles underscored with Auric's deeply tragic music followed by the first black and white scenes depicting Cecile's current active but deeply disengaged life. Then as Cecile arrives home and begins remembering last summer the blue Mediterranean sea begins to invade the frame little by little  a striking effect to say the least  we are there in the midst of a carefree vacation with Cecile Raymond and Elsa and quite successfully invited to forget the tragedy that seems to be in the making and enter a carefree sunlit world where nothing seemingly could ever go wrong. Masterful filmmaking and thus far perfectly pitched Seberg's perfectly expressionless and beautiful face has no small part in making it work. That she is less secure in the flashback scenes is unfortunate but her physical presence at least gives the right signs this is a very young girl happy but extremely shallow. Yes I will admit that the line readings are quite stiff  no question she is acting. But if one is already in the proper frame of mind they are not all that damaging. What's important is the holiday mood and the performances of Niven and Mylene Demongeot are sufficiently effervescent to evoke it. Demongeot is a real charmer  beautiful beyond belief and full of joie de vivre. The arrival of Deborah Kerr on the scene changes all this a dignified Lady coming into the midst of a world she finds immoral distasteful and in the deepest sense unacceptable her reaction to realizing that Raymond is shall we say shacking up with Elsa is the turning point of the film the crossroads of comedy and tragedy. And from this point we are invited to see how step by step comedy turns to tragedy. What's most wonderful about this film is how diverting that progression is. The world of the French Riviera is after all a world of carefree bliss at least on the surface and we are given ample opportunity to enjoy that along with the characters in the film a delightful casino scene enlivened by the presence of that wonderful actor Walter Chiari a truly handsome man with a wonderful flair for comedy and here playing opposite Demongeot particularly delightful and a visually stunning dance at the dock a masterpiece of costume design in delicious color and Cinemascope worthy of a Minnelli musical and in its delirious scale surpassing most of them. Finally let me just say that the final moments of the film and I will refrain from spoiling them are among the most moving in all cinema an evocation of selfloathing and emptiness that remains unrivaled in its beauty. Yes beauty. Caveat emptor It is useless to see this film in the panscan version I have had the experience and it is horrible.

	onyx:emotionText "A fascinating frustrating though ultimately deeply satisfying film. Many readers have commented on the frustrations and they are hard to deny. My experience of this movie goes back to the early 70s when I first encountered it in ideal circumstances at the Museum of Modern Art during its complete Preminger retrospective and in a gorgeous perfect print. A great introduction to a film whose very meaning resides in its glossy surface. The first few minutes of the film powerfully set up the tragedy that is to come Saul Bass's dripping teardrop titles underscored with Auric's deeply tragic music followed by the first black and white scenes depicting Cecile's current active but deeply disengaged life. Then as Cecile arrives home and begins remembering last summer the blue Mediterranean sea begins to invade the frame little by little  a striking effect to say the least  we are there in the midst of a carefree vacation with Cecile Raymond and Elsa and quite successfully invited to forget the tragedy that seems to be in the making and enter a carefree sunlit world where nothing seemingly could ever go wrong. Masterful filmmaking and thus far perfectly pitched Seberg's perfectly expressionless and beautiful face has no small part in making it work. That she is less secure in the flashback scenes is unfortunate but her physical presence at least gives the right signs this is a very young girl happy but extremely shallow. Yes I will admit that the line readings are quite stiff  no question she is acting. But if one is already in the proper frame of mind they are not all that damaging. What's important is the holiday mood and the performances of Niven and Mylene Demongeot are sufficiently effervescent to evoke it. Demongeot is a real charmer  beautiful beyond belief and full of joie de vivre. The arrival of Deborah Kerr on the scene changes all this a dignified Lady coming into the midst of a world she finds immoral distasteful and in the deepest sense unacceptable her reaction to realizing that Raymond is shall we say shacking up with Elsa is the turning point of the film the crossroads of comedy and tragedy. And from this point we are invited to see how step by step comedy turns to tragedy. What's most wonderful about this film is how diverting that progression is. The world of the French Riviera is after all a world of carefree bliss at least on the surface and we are given ample opportunity to enjoy that along with the characters in the film a delightful casino scene enlivened by the presence of that wonderful actor Walter Chiari a truly handsome man with a wonderful flair for comedy and here playing opposite Demongeot particularly delightful and a visually stunning dance at the dock a masterpiece of costume design in delicious color and Cinemascope worthy of a Minnelli musical and in its delirious scale surpassing most of them. Finally let me just say that the final moments of the film and I will refrain from spoiling them are among the most moving in all cinema an evocation of selfloathing and emptiness that remains unrivaled in its beauty. Yes beauty. Caveat emptor It is useless to see this film in the panscan version I have had the experience and it is horrible. The Columbia DVD edition looks great absolutely NO extras by the way it appears to have been simply dumped on the market  odd treatment of a masterpiece. Oh yes my title heading Preminger's previous films had mostly dealt with little events  noirs small comedies etc. most of his subsequent films Exodus The Cardinal Advise and Consent In Harms Way with Big Events.

	schema:headline " Jean Seberg weaves her magical charm on the viewer like none other.";
	schema:reviewBody "Jean Seberg is an absolute joy. I just wanna give her a big fat hug and kiss... well that's just two things anyway. What makes Otto Preminger's film so wonderful is that Seberg is the right age to play the part of a spoiled rich girl coming of age. Also the film is given an authenticity and heart because it was written by Franoise Sagan when she was the same age as Cecile Seberg. That's right this amazing and brilliant work was penned by a 17year old. The plot is fairly standard. A young girl living with her playboy father becomes jealous of his new love and when marriage is proposed she does her best to break it up. Gee nothing remarkable there. What is remarkable is the characters and their relationships. They have an extra amount of depth and the situation between Cecile and her father Raymond David Niven borders on the incestuous. This gives it an added dimension and depth when Anne Deborah Kerr threatens to steal her father away. Another place where it avoids clichs is dealing with Anne. Kerr plays her magnificently and with a warm passion. She is not the wicked step mother here but a sympathetic and self sacrificing woman who wants to bring love and stability into Cecile and Raymond's morally ambiguous and flighty lifestyle. This film while a modest success in America was a huge hit in Europe and inspired JeanLuc Godard to work with Seberg. Bonjour Tristesse also foreshadowed the films dealing with the idle rich that quickly popped up in its wake including two masterpieces Antonioni's L'avventura and Fellini's La Dolce Vita. Preminger directs Bonjour Tristesse with a sure hand and I love how the flashbacks are in color and the present day scenes are in a somber black and white to fit with the mood. Oh and yes the story is told in flashback for the most part and the technique along with Seberg's narration gives a heightened sense of loss that Cecile and Raymond feel towards the events that transpired concerning Anne. Remarkable film and Seberg is so delightful and hot running around in her bathing suit practically the whole time. Grade A".

The idea that a deepthinking responsible career woman comes into the lives of two bon vivants is an interesting one and you couldn't ask for a better cast. The beginning of the film and even Cecile's plan to get rid of Anne that she brings Elsa and her own boyfriend Phillipe in on has a lighthearted feel to it. What Raymond and Cecile never considered is that there are ramifications for actions Cecile due to her immaturity and Raymond because he's Raymond.David Niven is terrific as the dashing Raymond who loves a party and Deborah Kerr gives a warm performance as Anne who truly loves him and wants to ground both him and his daughter. The curiosity here is Seberg. She is as always the perfect gamine. Any time she's in a scene you can't take your eyes off of her. She's so darn beautiful.

	schema:reviewBody "Reviews of this film are more interesting and thought provoking than most. A number of them convey critical insights that certainly deepened my appreciation. Yes the film is flawed but it also resonates beyond standard soap opera mainly because of its tragic central premise. That the movie doesn't fully realize its aim I'm sorry to say is largely because of limitations in Seberg's performance. I agree she's a lively and compelling screen presence with a freshness that's genuinely appealing. However the role of Cecile calls upon more emotional depth than Seberg manages to convey especially with the absence of troubled emotions. Thus the sense of tragic outcome stems from sources other than Seberg's performance. Now there are several ways of looking at Cecile's emotional makeup and maturity but there's one I believe that most strongly recommends itself and also puts Seberg's performance in the best light.On this view Seberg has Cecile's character just right during the sunny Technicolor phase. Cecile is simply too immature to realize the potential consequences of her scheming actions. Thus Cecile Seberg attaches no more gravity to breaking up her father's relationship than she does to skipping her studies. She's all spoiled selfishness wrapped in a winsome smile. And it's not until the car crash that she realizes the consequences of her selfish act and experiences an emotional depth for the first time. Her scheme thus results not from making a wrongful choice but from not even realizing that a choice is being made. This view would vindicate ninetenths of Seberg's unconflicted Technicolor performance but not the black andwhite phase where Seberg fails to convey the conflict required. This view would also explain the added features of narration color change and Saul Bass graphics once Preminger realizes that Seberg's performance is not enough to convey the necessary sense of tragedy.Despite this central flaw the movie remains oddly haunting. Maybe it's because of a sun washed paradise so carelessly lost or of a summer of such promise turned into a lifetime of regret. I really like the observation that father and daughter behave as though actions have no consequences. As a result their humanity is only realized once the importance of this lesson is tragically driven home. Only by then it's too late. In my view the movie remains regrettably underrated.".

	onyx:emotionText "Reviews of this film are more interesting and thought provoking than most. A number of them convey critical insights that certainly deepened my appreciation. Yes the film is flawed but it also resonates beyond standard soap opera mainly because of its tragic central premise. That the movie doesn't fully realize its aim I'm sorry to say is largely because of limitations in Seberg's performance. I agree she's a lively and compelling screen presence with a freshness that's genuinely appealing. However the role of Cecile calls upon more emotional depth than Seberg manages to convey especially with the absence of troubled emotions. Thus the sense of tragic outcome stems from sources other than Seberg's performance. Now there are several ways of looking at Cecile's emotional makeup and maturity but there's one I believe that most strongly recommends itself and also puts Seberg's performance in the best light.On this view Seberg has Cecile's character just right during the sunny Technicolor phase. Cecile is simply too immature to realize the potential consequences of her scheming actions. Thus Cecile Seberg attaches no more gravity to breaking up her father's relationship than she does to skipping her studies. She's all spoiled selfishness wrapped in a winsome smile.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Preminger a man who went through many different phases in his work seemed to have a thing at least for a time for precocious young ladies see also Maggie McNamara in The Moon is Blue which also starred Niven. Here he directs a story about a playboy father Niven and his adoring but restless daughter Seberg whose idyllic vacation in the French Riviera turns sour upon the arrival of a motherly fashion designer. Niven and Seberg are frolicking carelessly along with his current squeeze Demongeot when word arrives that Seberg's godmother Kerr a friend of her deceased mother's is on her way to visit. At first Kerr is appalled at the setup and with the way Seberg behaves but once she realizes her options are few she begins to lighten up and enjoy herself. She enjoys herself so much that pretty soon Niven is smitten with her and curvy platinumblonde Demongeot is out on her tail! Meanwhile Seberg has fallen for local hunk Horne and they contemplate taking their relationship to the next level. When Kerr begins to assert a degree of control over Seberg and influence over Niven this sets in motion a plan to wreck her and Niven's relationship but in fact a great deal more than that is wrecked. In a gimmicky but reasonably effective move the film opens in stark black  white with Seberg narrating in an unfortunately pretentious and irritating way until the film flashes back to the glorious French scenery and Technicolor seeps in eventually filling the screen with lavish beauty. Occasionally the action shifts back to the black  white present day though the bulk of the film concerns the flashback sequences. Seberg still sporting her closecropped hair from Saint Joan her previous film with Preminger is a striking and interesting presence. Any lack of seasoning in her acting is compensated for by her exquisite beauty and her radiant energy which does occasionally stray over the top. Niven adeptly handles his role though he is given fairly few closeups in the film. He and Seberg share an unusual and controversial relationship with her calling him by his first name and with both of them frequently kissing each other and interacting physically. Kerr by now ensconced in ladylike roles gives an excellent and shaded performance though her initial costume is ghastly a big taupe sack basically. She deftly treads the line between unsympathetic interloper and caring concerned sensitive matron. Demongeot gets a rare chance in Englishspeaking films anyway to play a decent role and she handles it well bringing much humor and energy to it. Horne frequently clad in skimpy swim trunks is delectable and charming. Stalwart character actors Chiari and Hunt appear briefly as amusing casino patrons and Hunt is Horne's mother in the film. Greco is shown on screen in the present day section and sings the title song. It's a strangely unheralded film considering how splendidly it is photographed and how charmingly and effectively performed it is. The story is rather captivating as well. It's well worth a look.".

David Niven is more charming and relaxed than usual in contrast to the typically tightlaced Deborah Kerr who tries to impose some decorum upon the hedonists. Jean Seberg is delightful. Though her acting is terrible she makes up for it with warmth and beauty. It also helps that she spends most of the film running around in bathing suits. She beat Mia Farrow to the short cropped hair by ten years.

Cecile Jean Seberg an immature teenager fears her hedonistic but emotionally unsatisfying life will change once her likeminded playboy father Raymond David Niven decides to wed his late wife's prim and proper best friend Anne Deborah Kerr. Bound and determined not to let that happen the superstitious Cecile sets up a scenario for Anne's benefit that precipitates a fatal accident. Ann finding out that Raymond was incapable of changing was bound to happen on its own sooner or later but a guilty conscience caused a young girl to change Ann's accident to suicide in her mind. Fear of change is expected in a child and if they can children will try to influence adults. The events that unfolded that fateful summer although sad were not particularly unusual ...but not if seen through the eyes of a child. Cecile's reaction to the tragedy would eventually mature given the right conditions but in an odd filmic extension arrested development will have SebergCecile pedaling Parisian papers in Jean Luc Godard's BREATHLESS the following year. This is a visually stunning film with the black and white sequences symbolizing an empty lifeless present contrasted with the vibrant colors of a romanticized melodramatic past are particularly effective here and this device was later used for the same reason in Wade William's 1992 remake of Edgar Ulmer's DETOUR. Jean Seberg makes the movie and was far better than she was ever given credit for but her radiant beauty is almost matched by the Monroelike Mylene Demongeot playing Niven's latest ladylove. Deborah Kerr breathes life into a decent woman who's sense of right and wrong clashes with reality in the wrong environment and David Niven is suitably debonair doting and shallow as Cecile's childlike father on whom the girl models her behavior. Darryl F. Zanuck's mistress Juliette Greco sings the title tune as herself.I've never read the teenage author Francois Sagan's novel but BONJOUR TRISTESSE is not nearly as dark as I remembered it and now plays like The Teenage Confessions Of A Drama Queen right down to the detached yet overwrought voiceover narration. The inherently tragic irony here is that by not changing her lifestyle Cecile's life has been irreparably altered ...or so she thinks at that young age. Although highly praised in France both Seberg and the film were not kindly received at the time of its release but time has proved Preminger's instincts spot on.I'd give this a Recommended even though many find it fodder for SATURDAYNIGHT LIVE's Bad Cinema.".

I am not sure if any other films have this distinction but it certainly is unusual. Then throughout the film it switched from color to black  whitea daring move that may or may not distract the viewer.As another reviewer pointed out the film has very strong Oedipal overtones. The film centers on the life of two rather freethinking peoplea father and daughter David Niven and Jean Seberg who seem amazingly chummymore so than is typical. They hug and kiss so often and have very vague personal boundaries that the viewer most likely will feel a bit creeped out by them. And the father and daughter talks about the father's love life with the young bombshell Mylne Demongeothis latest conquest. Unusual to say the least! Because there is this seething undercurrent things turn out very bad when a domineering woman Deborah Kerr comes back into their lives and threatens the relationship between father and daughter. Unlike Dad's other women Kerr seems less willing to share him with SebergMylne who was quite young acted more like a goofy sister or friend to Seberg instead of an adult. Kerr is definitely NOT goofy or much fun for the daughter. In fact Kerr begins acting like she is Seberg's mother soon after her arrival .Now this brings me to a major problem with Oedipus II I mean Bonjour Tristesse. Niven is a bit of a bohemian...yet he suddenly gives up his funloving life for the wet blanket Kerr. She is neither young nor sexy and seems as much fun as a missionary at a sex workers' convention! So what exactly motivated Niven?! I have no idea. While I am a pretty conservative type guy I thought Kerr was dull and antifunso why would Niven then be drawn to her?! Now I could understand Seberg disliking this new arrangementthat at least made sense. After all Kerr is rather awful and Seberg just wants to have fun.Now I actually think the Oedipal angle while creepy was pretty interesting. While they never could have gotten away with this in the 1950s it would have really been interesting if Niven and Seberg's relationship had been much more intimateor at least more strongly implied. Then the creepy love triangle might have been a lot more explosive and interesting. But while I am thinking about it Kerr's character needed to become less unlikable. This is because she was too easy to hate and too onedimensional. As I said above it made no sense that Niven could want to marry this awful person. So toning down Kerr and increasing the fatherdaughter sexual tension might have made the film a lot more interestingand completely blown away audiences of the dayso much so that this might not have made it past the censors.So as it is is the film worth seeing even if it is a tad sanitized for 50s tastes? Well the idea of Seberg plotting to destroy Kerr is awfully intriguing. Plus to a degree you must agree with Sebergthough not her methods. After all I felt like rapping Kerr's character in the mouth myself and wanted to see something bad happen. Because of this and good acting the film really is interesting and hard to stop watchinglike a high quality but sleazy soaper such as Peyton Place. Beware that it is a bit slow at the beginningbear with it it does get betterand it ends quite well. In fact the ending is quite hauntingand lingers even after the final credits have rolled.".

Beware that it is a bit slow at the beginningbear with it it does get betterand it ends quite well. In fact the ending is quite hauntingand lingers even after the final credits have rolled.";

Oy.Preminger's adaptation of Franoise Sagan's breathlessly juvenile fantasy soap opera plot is noteworthy only for his lush cinematography  but then that's difficult to funk on the photogenic French Riviera and perhaps for his apt but certainly not groundbreaking employment of black  white for the present day scenes from which Seberg's monotone narration delivers us to the flashedbackto color past.Juliette Grco has a brief moment as a nightclub chanteuse in the black  white spotlight delivering in smoky Dietrichesque voice the bleak existentialist lyric of the title song. This moment is nowadays in retrospect more than a wee bit drle. Except of course if you're French  particularly if you're a French 68er longing for the glorious days of the barricades roundabout the Sorbonne  and your kids riot to retain the lifelong sinecures which have blighted and emasculated France's economy then you still believe in Sartre and Foucault and all such arcane irrelevant theorists.David Niven has the hardest role having to play with sufficient gusto an aging hedonist who's yet to grasp that life isn't all about Sagan's teenybopper notions of a hip cool swingin' mon copain! Papa. Deborah Kerr delivers her usual consummately professional presence convincingly playing the woman who suffers undeservedly Seberg's spiteful teenaged snotnose jealousy fulfilling Sagan's shallow teen fantasy of the Classical theme of there can be only one Queen Bee in the hive in fact to Kerr belongs this film's sole great and memorable onscreen moment.The dialogue is unnatural  I agree with an earlier reviewer who said that it sounds to be badly translated from French combine the unnatural scripting with Seberg's incomparably dull unendurable monotone and you can save that Valium for another night. Atop all that the ineptly synched postproduction voice dubbing is almost throughout obvious and thus much more than irksome this is especially true of the dubbing for Mylne Demongeot because it spoils her otherwise very pleasing dumb blonde performance.Hunky Geoffrey Horne gets the short end of the stick here  a very good looking young man who also suffered from a lessthanlovely uncinematic voice which when paired with Seberg's drone yields unconvincing scenes of puppy love. Horne was shall we say merely adequate in 'Bridge On the River Kwai' perhaps because his end was held up by those great cinema pros William Holden and Jack Hawkins instead of being unsupported by the regrettably ungifted Seberg.In sum 'Bonjour tristesse' is pretty to look at but it's shallow immature soap thin gruel with suds.".

Then bang Raymond expresses his affections to Anne and proposes to marry her and suddenly Elsa being kicked out of the picture. The match seems perfect even in the eyes of Ccile maternity endearment is something very healthy for her growth and nobody could be more suitable than Anne to assume that role. But soon the spoiled side of her nature eggs her to defy Anne's matronly discipline and an apparently naive plan with the help of Philippe a fool in love and the brilliant Elsa to scuttle Raymond and Anne's marriage will go haywire and the aftermath will make Ccile rue the day.There is something inherently vapidly in Sagon's story but the movie retains magnificently a superficial but bewitching unpretentiousness of Raymond and Ccile which makes them watchable they are not intelligent people Anne is evidently too good for them but on the other hand they are very much honest to themselves the tragedy could have been avoided there is no clarification it is an accident or a suicide but the marriage would still hit a bumper road in a long run in a way Ccile's scheme only help Anne to see through Raymond's nature so from a more cautionary aspect the whole story seems to bear witness that we should never have the illusion that one's unconditional love can change a person either take it wholly or leave it immediately there is no grey area here.Preminger really loved Seberg after the flop of SAINT JOAN 1957 Seberg's screen debut he didn't give her up here he cherrypicks her a tailormade role and unreservedly puts her in the centre of the narrative to flesh out her elfin mischief singular delicacy all in a continental style prepares her for the starmaking triumph in Godard's BREATHLESS 1960.The NivenKerr pair works side by side twice in a calendar year compared with a more self inflicted restraint in Delbert Mann's ensemble piece SEPARATE TABLES 1958 Niven is much more nonchalant as a sybarite to quote Raymond  is silly and vain whereas Kerr hops up with a refreshingly relaxed air of being the unattainable Anne during her flashy entrance only not soon would she backtrack to the stereotype of Raymond I cannot be casual seriousness or in Ccile's words the prim prissy and prude.Calling BONJOUR TRISTESSE a high point of Preminger or any these leading stars' coruscating careers is a farfetched argument however its reputation and mojo as a levelheaded cinematic raconteur endures the test of time sleekly orchestrated by Preminger's efficient artifice and Auric's stringheavy score.".

But soon the spoiled side of her nature eggs her to defy Anne's matronly discipline and an apparently naive plan with the help of Philippe a fool in love and the brilliant Elsa to scuttle Raymond and Anne's marriage will go haywire and the aftermath will make Ccile rue the day.There is something inherently vapidly in Sagon's story but the movie retains magnificently a superficial but bewitching unpretentiousness of Raymond and Ccile which makes them watchable they are not intelligent people Anne is evidently too good for them but on the other hand they are very much honest to themselves the tragedy could have been avoided there is no clarification it is an accident or a suicide but the marriage would still hit a bumper road in a long run in a way Ccile's scheme only help Anne to see through Raymond's nature so from a more cautionary aspect the whole story seems to bear witness that we should never have the illusion that one's unconditional love can change a person either take it wholly or leave it immediately there is no grey area here.Preminger really loved Seberg after the flop of SAINT JOAN 1957 Seberg's screen debut he didn't give her up here he cherrypicks her a tailormade role and unreservedly puts her in the centre of the narrative to flesh out her elfin mischief singular delicacy all in a continental style prepares her for the starmaking triumph in Godard's BREATHLESS 1960.The NivenKerr pair works side by side twice in a calendar year compared with a more self inflicted restraint in Delbert Mann's ensemble piece SEPARATE TABLES 1958 Niven is much more nonchalant as a sybarite to quote Raymond  is silly and vain whereas Kerr hops up with a refreshingly relaxed air of being the unattainable Anne during her flashy entrance only not soon would she backtrack to the stereotype of Raymond I cannot be casual seriousness or in Ccile's words the prim prissy and prude.Calling BONJOUR TRISTESSE a high point of Preminger or any these leading stars' coruscating careers is a farfetched argument however its reputation and mojo as a levelheaded cinematic raconteur endures the test of time sleekly orchestrated by Preminger's efficient artifice and Auric's stringheavy score.";

The cinematography is wonderful the music is superb. I wouldn't watch it for the story as much as for the interesting take on relationships and especially for the way the director tells the story through the camera set ups.The acting is not always compelling. Jean Seberg and the younger actors are attractive and charming but not brilliant. David Niven is very good. Deborah Kerr is on a different level she gives a very polished and meaningful performance.".

	schema:headline " Alternately quirky and affecting this heartwarming movie with its laidback charm and deadpan humour is anchored by a virtuoso performance by Sean Penn";
	schema:reviewBody "Is there a role which eludes Sean Penn? In Italian director Paolo Sorrentino's Englishlanguage debut following his 2008 Cannes hit 'Il Divo' the twotime Academy Award winner takes on an unlikely comedic role as an overthehill pop star named Cheyenne and pulls it off with aplomb. Indeed even though the movie never does quite come together as a cohesive whole Penn's brilliant performance more than anchors the entire film and you'll find yourself hardpressed to take your eyes off him.To say that Penn owns the entire movie is not an overstatement right from the start Penn mesmerises with a bizarre getup consisting of a jetblack fright wig and allblack lipstick and eyeliner even in the comfort of his own sprawling home. As is typical of such characters Cheyenne suffers from depression and besides doing the groceries while his fireman of a wife Frances McDormand is off at work spends most of his time in the day hanging out with a spunky teen Mary Eve Hewson at a caf in a shopping mall.Purpose is what is lacking in his life haunted by the suicide of two brothers who said they were inspired by his lyrics Cheyenne has not been able to return to his music since. For the first half hour Sorrentino familiarises his audience with the idiosyncrasies of his lead character as well as his marriage with his wife Jane and thanks to an empathetic performance by Penn your heart will go out to this lost soul searching for that elusive thing called meaning. It is testament to Penn's flawless performance that you'll still feel the warmth and heart behind his character's eccentricities.Cheyenne awakens from his stupor when he gets news that his father is dying and promptly makes the travel by cruise because of his fear of flying to New York. Unfortunately he arrives too late missing the very last opportunity to connect with the father he has not spoken to in years. So when his cousin Richard Liron Levo informs him that his dad was obsessed with tracking down a Nazi war criminal at Auschwitz named Aloise Lange Heinz Lieven Cheyenne takes it upon himself to complete his father's mission.And so begins a road trip across the United States each pitstop in Michigan New Mexico and finally Utah offering memorable encounters with locals that in their own way serve to give him closure and reconciliation. Mirroring Cheyenne's own inner transformation Sorrentino adopts a measured pace as Cheyenne meets a history teacher Joyce Van Patten a war widow Kerry Condon his dad's fellow Nazi hunter Mordecai Midler Judd Hirsch and finally of course Lange himself. Less patient viewers will probably be frustrated but those willing to accept the laidback tone of the film will find Cheyenne's journey a rather therapeutic one especially in its closing lesson on the importance of learning to let go of the past.Sorrentino who cowrote the script with Umberto Contrarello also lightens the mood of the film with some wellplaced deadpan humour delivered with panache by Penn. A scene where Cheyenne meets a gaggle of women in the lift discussing which brand of lipstick is best and finally gives them due advice just to shut them up is sharply hilarious while his wellmeaning attempt at matchmaking Mary with an earnest shopping mall staff proves sweet and amusing. But through the varying types of humour it is Penn's unpretentious acting that makes them work with a recurring gesture of Penn casually blowing a wisp of hair falling across his face perhaps the most consistently delightful narrative device. Among his costars McDormand shines in her role as Cheyenne's wife and a sequence where she is practising taichi in her lawn while distracted by her husband in the upper window one of the best moments in the film.For rock fans the participation of David Bryne is no doubt a highlight in itself and Sorrentino pleases his fans with an extended concert scene that has the rock star performing the title song of the film while a woman in a room that reflects a period setting floats above the crowd. Nonetheless for us cinephiles the delight is in watching Sean Penn take on an unlikely comedic role in spite of his dramatic credentials. If it isn't yet apparent we'll say it again Penn's flawless performance is good enough reason to visit this place and it's one that is warm touching and unexpectedly affecting. www.moviexclusive.com".

	schema:headline " Its about time!";
	schema:reviewBody "It took quite a while until this movie comes to the US I do not know why it took so long yet I hope it gets the response it deserves I saw it in Europe months ago already. Sean Penn is just amazing and the whole movie is something you don't see much in US cinemas. Its so different that there is almost no comparison. Of course it will be a big hit within the Gothic scene but also the regular movie fan should give it a try. Its very slow paced road trip but Penn carries that overwhelmingly with his outstanding performance of the character who reminds of course of Robert Smith but in a superb way. The story is very simple and so I leave that totally out since it would spoil it right away.My favorite scene is when he visits the show from David Bryne playing This must be the place keep it in mind and enjoy the show! Its certainly an experience for real movie fans! That it won't be a huge box office hit most likely should not hold anybody back who wants to see a good movie!".

The firsttime viewer watching Sean Penn apply eye make up and lipstick doesn't know whether his character is a psychotic killer or a sad sack cross dresser but over time we learn that he is a childlike creature an aging pop star who can be simultaneously a nitwit and a truthteller. The Nazi connection was a stretch that took me by surprise it comes about at the death of Penn's character's father. Judd Hirsch playing the role of Nazi hunter galvanizes Penn's lost soul into following his father's mission and together they pursue a neglected Nazi war criminal to a onepersonal trailer park in Utah. Great casting here. Harry Dean Stanton has an intriguing bit part. Francis McDormand is the most understanding spouse in the whole world. Very quirky plot. Can't wait to see it again.".

The topic of the Holocaust is presented in a smart sophisticated and almost delicate way like I have never seen before. Despite that or maybe because if the delicate approach it is no less effective in recalling the Holocaust than let's say The Schindler's list. But very different of course. The film is very well directed and I like the soundtrack as well. The film has a strange hypnotic flow and rhythm to it despite being slow in some parts. It can be funny too. The acting is excellent especially by Penn but not only. Highly recommended.".

Sean Penn's performance was for me the centre of this film especially the dialogue that was sometimes very sharp and unexpected. It must be said however that the movie went on a lot of unnecessary tangents. Whole plot lines were opened up and then left unresolved. The biggest one seems to be the disappearance of the Irish boy Tony. There are several scenes involving Tony's mother but they lead nowhere. Basically someone should have got into the script cut all the flab out and focused on what is important here  the character of Cheyenne and his misadventures.If you had to categorise this movie you would probably put it in the selfdiscoveryroad movie basket. Cheyenne is having a bit of a crisis goes travelling and then rediscovers himself. Unfortunately in Cheyenne's world there is very little meaning to be found. Things happen arbitrarily people launch into meaningless random conversations in almost every scene. The camera focuses on bizarre unrelated objects. It seems like there isn't very much to learn from a world like this so the message I got was you may as well be yourself. I was expecting the movie to end with Cheyenne back in Dublin hugging his wife and saying something like I guess I like things just the way they are. It was therefore surprising to me that there was only one scene with Cheyenne back in Dublin and it didn't involve his friends of family at all. Instead he is looking at the cranky mother who lost her son and he is dressed as blandly as possible. It's difficult to draw any meaning from this scene although it's possibly implying that he is now embarking on a normal life. It was a contradictory and a very dissatisfying conclusion.".

I know the director is Italian but there's nothing European about this movie yes that's a criticism!.It's studiously quirky. So studious that the quirkiness becomes predictable. Pan.... reveal! Cut! Quirkiness in every shot.Sean Penn's character is believable but mostly close to inaudible.This movie could be a lot more fun if played at 33 speed with graphic speech bubbles for Sean Penn.The indie Americana spirit continues with the simpering acoustic soundtrack. I don't think this had ever annoyed me I was always a fan of folk and acoustic music until I saw Juno. Then I heard acoustic guitars and simpering in almost every indie movie. Awww... so sensitive. So sensitive they're afraid to move beyond the five safe notes. Bless.David Byrne's cameo felt as much an awkward nonsequitur as the inclusion of The Lovin' Spoonful in Whats up Tiger Lily? and that was 1966 so I guess the director achieved something there.I personally think David Byrne isn't clever original or interesting so I'm probably biased.If you like David Byrne want to see Sean Penn play Robert Smith's Aspergers doppelganger and like high levels of quirkiness delivered quite slowly watch it. I wish you well and hope that your time will feel less wasted than mine.".

Quirkiness in every shot.Sean Penn's character is believable but mostly close to inaudible.This movie could be a lot more fun if played at 33 speed with graphic speech bubbles for Sean Penn.The indie Americana spirit continues with the simpering acoustic soundtrack. I don't think this had ever annoyed me I was always a fan of folk and acoustic music until I saw Juno. Then I heard acoustic guitars and simpering in almost every indie movie. Awww... so sensitive. So sensitive they're afraid to move beyond the five safe notes. Bless.David Byrne's cameo felt as much an awkward nonsequitur as the inclusion of The Lovin' Spoonful in Whats up Tiger Lily? and that was 1966 so I guess the director achieved something there.I personally think David Byrne isn't clever original or interesting so I'm probably biased.If you like David Byrne want to see Sean Penn play Robert Smith's Aspergers doppelganger and like high levels of quirkiness delivered quite slowly watch it. I wish you well and hope that your time will feel less wasted than mine.";

It was really distracting and I didn't find the camera work that fun to look at.The script leaves a lot of stuff untold. There is talk about people who are seemingly important but they are never explained who they are and while you have ideas it's not something you'd like to spend any energy guessing.

	schema:headline " A confused rare misfire for the ever reliable Sean Penn due to a hopelessly muddled screenplay";
	schema:reviewBody "An ageing softly spoken Gothic rock star named Cheyenne Sean Penn is bored with his life in Dublin. He opts to wear full makeup everyday and lives in a huge mansion with his wife Jane Frances McDormand who is a firefighter. He is also friends with Mary Eve Hewson an unhappy Goth girl who has been separated from her mother. Cheyenne tries and fails to set her up with someone in the mall who is interested in her. He also regularly visits the grave of a boy because he feels responsible for his death even though the parents tell him not to visit. One of the other major threads in Cheyenne's life is that he has not spoken to his father in thirty years who was a holocaust survivor in Auschwitz. When he learns of his death Cheyenne decides to travel across America and with the help of a man named Mordecai Judd Hirsch he works to find the Nazi war criminal Aloise Heinz Lieven who humiliated his father. This is a confused rare misfire for the ever reliable Sean Penn due to a hopelessly muddled screenplay. It is the first English language feature of Italian director Paolo Sorrentino who also cowrote the script with Umberto Contrarello. The film starts promisingly because Sorrentino's first major theme isolation is a successful one. He resorts to giving Cheyenne's house a cool sterile look through a white colour palette scheme. This is deliberately at odds with Cheyenne's Gothic appearance. He's been compared quite accurately to the lead singer of The Cure Robert Smith. He is always dressed in black with dark eyeliner and red lipstick that characterises him deliberately as feminine and therefore misplaced against any lighter tones. People stare at him in malls and supermarkets either to take pictures or just to laugh at his appearance. Further visualising his stasis and isolation is Sorrentino's camera where the tracking shots are purposely slow in their movements to show how this bloke is drifting rather aimlessly through life. Unfortunately the same can be said about the film itself. The script is so overloaded with strange details side characters and threads that its almost an impenetrable movie. There's little clarity about who exactly these people are how they relate to each other and why they're in this film other than to project an idea rather than a personality. I found the relationship between Mary and Cheyenne who he insists is not his daughter to be quite bizarre since they regularly hang out together. Even more unlikely is the brief time he spends with a waitress who recognises him and then lets him stay with her and her son briefly. It's equally frustrating that many characters including the wasted talents of Frances McDormand fade out of the story for so long that there is no continuity in the plot leaving the film without a focus. The misguidance of the narrative is apparent is just how long it takes to reach the film's main revenge thread. It's close to an hour into the film and ends on a whimper. Adding further confusion is the film's reliance on selfconscious dialogue that is infuriatingly cryptic. When he's told that his burger is overcooked Cheyenne replies We go from an age when we say 'My life will be that' to an age when we say 'That's life'. I'm all for Wes Andersonlike quirkiness but lines like this really test your threshold for pseudointellectualism. At most one can praise the bravery of Penn's performance one of the strangest of a distinguished career even if his character's motives are unclear and implausible. 'Remote' is not a word you normally associate with Penn but he succeeds in making Cheyenne cold and distant and sometimes funny through his small whispery voice followed by an occasional outburst that is true to his passiveaggressive nature. In spite of the lead performance though it's a very unsatisfying and unmoving film that shares all too much in common with its central character.".

	schema:headline " Sean Penn in The Sims";
	schema:reviewBody "I strongly believe this movie was taken right out of The Sims where some 11 year old kid had his imaginary mind come to play as he made up some imaginary story about some 50 year old Goth living in a big house. Even if the story was true why would anyone make a movie about this??? There are 50.000 stories out there and a 50 year old Goth avenging his fathers death hunting down a Nazi. Cmon! For the fact that the goth is a whispering weak slow just out of a coma kind of guy doesn't make this interesting. If he at least had some character to him rather than the weakling he plays it could be somewhat enduring for me. And now they are probably going to rave it up to the skies like the 7 score here on IMDb with it because people think different is all it should take to make it cult.First of all its not even remotely interesting. Slow and badly eccentric. And then when you find out the scenes which are so intelligently glued together has nothing to do with the plot of the movie but to bring forth some ordinary people dressed up as puppets it all starts to make even less sense. The activities they have in the movie are just glued together in different locations. The third part is that the role Sean plays just kills every interest you have about it. When i found out there is nothing really more to it than what you see that just did it for me. Like staring at paint drying. Maybe some special people will find this interesting. I found it stupid boring badly eccentric and SLOW. Not even once did my imagination start to ask questions there is absolutely nothing behind the curtains of it. I was hoping for something and there has been other movies like it where i just sit through it enduring for it to hopefully have a catch in the end. There is nothing. Like the creator thought he made it for it to be viewed as art and that it will become a cult movie or something.If you don't mind staring at a film with no relative story to the actors and can endure slow and rather mixed up scenes which are not tied up to the rest of the plot and the ending then fine go ahead and watch it. I personally cant believe this movie got a 7 score. Sean Penns character and i like Sean Penn looks like a messed up neurotic dressed up in Goth clothing and not the other way around. Make that a 50 year old messed up neurotic with speech problems dressed up in goth clothing. I thought it would bring forth a laugh his character is so... like a puppet a weak slow stupid clown of a puppet could be the worst character i have ever seen in any movie. Maybe i just don't get this DramaComedy even if its Dark. Maybe if they hired Keith Richards for the role it would have been better loll. And when he opens his mouth you start to wonder if thats what this film is about. I just wonder why he did not stutter and roll in on a wheelchair on the opening scene put some psycho music score in the background and it would have all been so very much more entertaining. I don't know if they tried to make another eccentric hit like Edward Scissorhand or what this is that people can make movies that leaves you traumatized without even trying. At least Tim Burton knows what he was doing as Scissorhands is not the best played out stories on screen either but at least he got Edward through the film and made him memorable. This movie i just want to forget about but that cover is going to haunt me for the rest of my life.".

When i found out there is nothing really more to it than what you see that just did it for me. Like staring at paint drying. Maybe some special people will find this interesting. I found it stupid boring badly eccentric and SLOW. Not even once did my imagination start to ask questions there is absolutely nothing behind the curtains of it. I was hoping for something and there has been other movies like it where i just sit through it enduring for it to hopefully have a catch in the end. There is nothing. Like the creator thought he made it for it to be viewed as art and that it will become a cult movie or something.If you don't mind staring at a film with no relative story to the actors and can endure slow and rather mixed up scenes which are not tied up to the rest of the plot and the ending then fine go ahead and watch it. I personally cant believe this movie got a 7 score. Sean Penns character and i like Sean Penn looks like a messed up neurotic dressed up in Goth clothing and not the other way around. Make that a 50 year old messed up neurotic with speech problems dressed up in goth clothing. I thought it would bring forth a laugh his character is so... like a puppet a weak slow stupid clown of a puppet could be the worst character i have ever seen in any movie. Maybe i just don't get this DramaComedy even if its Dark. Maybe if they hired Keith Richards for the role it would have been better loll. And when he opens his mouth you start to wonder if thats what this film is about. I just wonder why he did not stutter and roll in on a wheelchair on the opening scene put some psycho music score in the background and it would have all been so very much more entertaining. I don't know if they tried to make another eccentric hit like Edward Scissorhand or what this is that people can make movies that leaves you traumatized without even trying. At least Tim Burton knows what he was doing as Scissorhands is not the best played out stories on screen either but at least he got Edward through the film and made him memorable. This movie i just want to forget about but that cover is going to haunt me for the rest of my life.";

	schema:reviewBody "The central character in 'This Must be the Place' is arguably the film's biggest problem. Cheyenne is a fiftysomething exmusician self lobotomised by a drink and drugs fuelled rock star life who has been hiding out in reclusive splendour in Dublin Ireland for over twenty years. It is unbelievable to anyone with even a fleeting knowledge of Dublin that a man with that name could live in the Irish capital and not end up being called Shy Ann or Shane the Apache or some other reductive appellation typical of Dublin wit. While Sorrentino may have known that there was a time in the Nineties when everyone with a celebrity sticker from Lisa Stanfield to Salman Rushdie came to live in 'Cool Hibernia' he appears not to be aware of that Irish intolerance for pretentious whackery would have made it virtually impossible for this bushy haired moron to leave in peace on the Island. Why do you think Bob Geldof lives in London? I'm just saying . . ..Apparently Cheyenne was inspired by The Cure's Robert Smith. Well in the hair and lipstick department maybe this is true. But it is worth noting that Mr. Smith has a 'normal' name and still makes great music. I am sure he would be none too pleased being associated with the self indulgent heroin saturated pile of royalties driftwood dished up by the man who previously gave us brilliantly Harvey Milk or Jimmy Markum. Sean Penn's latest persona is a limping cross between an Ozzy Osbourne meetsJack Sparrow caricature and someone who has somehow survived the terrible intellectual trauma inflicted by a plane crash only to emerge suffering from rapiddescent induced haemorrhoids. Some will say Cheyenne is more Penn acting genius but whether it is or its is not it does not work here. The opening third of the film is set in a Dublin that barely escapes the gardens of what looks like the British embassy residence !! and a suburb under the shadow of the new Aviva stadium. Apparently the melancholy of Dublin was chosen as suitable territory for a story that later deals with themes of regret and retribution leading Sorrentino to move the opening filming location from London. But Dublin itself features very little however and plays no real part in conveying any sense of the pain or suffering of the protagonist. However the Irish scenes feature some of the film's best comedic moments like Simon Delaney's hilarious exposition of his tricks to attract women. The Irish cast also including Olwen Fouere acquit themselves admirably but in side action which seems like unessential stuffing. Cheyenne for example has a mercilessly dull galpal Mary played by the bland Eve Hewson. Mary a sort of twentysomething groupie has found herself latched onto Cheyenne perhaps to represent a character balance to the pop icon's insanity but instead she hovers about like another reason for it. Mary is only valuable for a laugh at her expense when a young suitor who has been fruitlessly chasing her affections turns out to be gay thus bestowing the audience with a joyous sense of salvation for the young man's future happiness. The news is broken to us by none other than the brilliant Frances McDormand playing 'Jane' Cheyenne's adoring wife of thirty years. And yes it stretches credibility to its elasticated limits that Jane is an active member of the Dublin Fire Brigade. But if you can bring yourself to overcome this further absurdity . . .It is really not until 'Place' slowly drags itself and the audience away from Dublin to the USA that the real story begins to unfold. By now of course the heretofore maudlin Cheyenne is such a painful article that you neither care for him or his musical past. From the minute the boat arrives on the east coast he doesn't fly one feels that Cheyenne almost gets in the way of the evolving story. Despite the mounting odds a slowly emerging storyline concerning Cheyenne's Jewish father who has spent a lifetime hunting a persecutor from his time in Auschwitz ropes the viewer in. Cheyenne's father has died just when he had almost tracked the Nazi down thus bringing Cheyenne on a road trip to complete his father's quest. Thus Cheyenne remains as the irritating conduit through which we get to meet a host of other characters as he embarks on his journey. Oh well at least the wonderful Judd Hirsch who is on top comedic and dramatic form steps in. The brilliant Kerry Condon also features as a tragic war widow Rachel and Shea Wigham is memorable a busy if disturbed Texan investment broker. Other cameos from Harry Dean Stanton and David Byrne however are not so successful. Stanton's set of gum delph is a complete distraction the set of porcelain looks like it has been robbed from the mouth of Reese Witherspoon. Byrne on the other hand takes over a full scene with a stirring if overlong rendition of the song from which the film takes its title but he then promptly dies like a rabbit stuck in headlights in the subsequent scene looking as though he cannot come to terms with Penn's character.'Place' is billed as a comedy and despite strong comic moments they often feel out of place. As the film progresses the comedy ultimately seems pointless as the seriousness of the subject matter takes hold until the dnouement somewhere in the Utah Alps when all sense of comedy evaporates. Sorrentino has brought his old cinematographer mate. Luca Bigazzi on board again with this film which it has to be said is beautifully shot. But the visual experience is lost to a frustrating and overly ambitious story one which was perhaps too much too soon for Sorrentino to take on and control not least his leading man.".

	schema:reviewBody "OUR LITTLE GIRL Fox 1935 directed by John Robertson a domestic drama taken from a story Heaven's Gate stars Shirley Temple Joel McCrea and someone by the name of Rosemary Ames in her final screen appearance following a very brief movie career. Similar in theme to RKO Radio's WEDNESDAY'S CHILD 1934 that revolves around a boy Frankie Thomas whose happy home is disrupted by the separation of his parents Edward Arnold and Karen Morley OUR LITTLE GIRL centers around the moppet Temple facing the same situation of her own but without any courtroom or child custody battles which might have helped quicken the pace or added more interest to a somewhat slow scenario.Set in a small town the plot introduces the Middletons as a happy family Donald Joel McCrea a respectable doctor Elsa Rosemary Ames his loving wife and their little girl Molly Shirley Temple who looks forward to their twice a year family picnic each May and September Saturday at a park called Heaven's Gate. Donald works long and hard on his experiments along with his assistant Sarah Boiton Erin O'BrienMoore a nurse who's secretly in love with him. Because he's away from home too often Elsa spends much of her lonely hours with Rolfe Brent Lyle Talbot her former horse breading beau who recently has moved into town from Europe. Due to Donald's misunderstanding and jealously towards Elsa and Rolfe the couple argue leading little Molly to find herself caught in the middle of things and unable to comprehend why her father will no longer be living with them anymore. After overhearing a conversation between her mother and Rolfe that has her believing that she's the cause for her parent's separation Molly decides to take matters into her own hands by leaving home.A minor Temple drama with little of the Temple formula intact. Aside from singing a lullaby to her doll and later playing Stephen Foster's Banjo on My Knee on the piano there are no songs nor dance numbers. Considering its theme song interludes have no precedence in the story though some slight doses of humor including Temple on the seesaw with her dog Sniffy as examples that keep the narrative from becoming strictly melodramatic. Unlike her more recent releases OUR LITTLE GIRL is the only one of Temple's leading roles that can be categorized as strictly B product considering it being the shortest 63 minutes of her starring film roles.Others in the supporting cast consist of Poodles Hannerton as the Circus Performer Margaret Armstrong Amy the Middleton housekeeper Ruth Owin Alice and Leonard Carey Jackson each as Brent's servants and best of all J. Farrell MacDonald billed as Mr. Tramp playing a homeless man who comforts little Molly by listening to her story as to why she's leaving home. This little scene is well handled with some humor in spoken dialog by Shirley thrown in for good measure. Watch for it. OUR LITTLE GIRL became one of many Temple movies to become available on video cassette during the late 1980s and then on DVD in both black and white and colorized formats. Formerly presented on The Disney Channel in the 1980s in colorized version it then turned up on American Movie Classics as part of its Sunday morning Kids Classics 19962001 and finally on the Fox Movie Channel in its original black and white format. Bob Dorian former host of AMC once commented in his profile about OUR LITTLE GIRL in saying that its working title Heaven's Gate had been changed prior to release due to it the name suggesting a cemetery leaving an indication as being a movie about death.Although OUR LITTLE GIRL didn't turn out as interesting as the rarely seen WEDNESDAY'S CHILD 1934 nor become the Academy Award winner as KRAMER Vs. KRAMER 1979 it's one of those little movies that might have been better had it not been hampered by a weak script. Had it not been for Our Little Girl Shirley Temple in the title role keeping the story alive with her knowhow performance then this minor effort of hers would certainly have ended up along with many old Fox Films to be either lost forgotten or both. 12".

	onyx:emotionText "OUR LITTLE GIRL Fox 1935 directed by John Robertson a domestic drama taken from a story Heaven's Gate stars Shirley Temple Joel McCrea and someone by the name of Rosemary Ames in her final screen appearance following a very brief movie career. Similar in theme to RKO Radio's WEDNESDAY'S CHILD 1934 that revolves around a boy Frankie Thomas whose happy home is disrupted by the separation of his parents Edward Arnold and Karen Morley OUR LITTLE GIRL centers around the moppet Temple facing the same situation of her own but without any courtroom or child custody battles which might have helped quicken the pace or added more interest to a somewhat slow scenario.Set in a small town the plot introduces the Middletons as a happy family Donald Joel McCrea a respectable doctor Elsa Rosemary Ames his loving wife and their little girl Molly Shirley Temple who looks forward to their twice a year family picnic each May and September Saturday at a park called Heaven's Gate. Donald works long and hard on his experiments along with his assistant Sarah Boiton Erin O'BrienMoore a nurse who's secretly in love with him. Because he's away from home too often Elsa spends much of her lonely hours with Rolfe Brent Lyle Talbot her former horse breading beau who recently has moved into town from Europe. Due to Donald's misunderstanding and jealously towards Elsa and Rolfe the couple argue leading little Molly to find herself caught in the middle of things and unable to comprehend why her father will no longer be living with them anymore. After overhearing a conversation between her mother and Rolfe that has her believing that she's the cause for her parent's separation Molly decides to take matters into her own hands by leaving home.A minor Temple drama with little of the Temple formula intact. Aside from singing a lullaby to her doll and later playing Stephen Foster's Banjo on My Knee on the piano there are no songs nor dance numbers. Considering its theme song interludes have no precedence in the story though some slight doses of humor including Temple on the seesaw with her dog Sniffy as examples that keep the narrative from becoming strictly melodramatic.

In one she is separated from her father and is pursued by a creepy guy who keeps offering to take her out and buy her candy in MANY she's an orphan and in this one she's in the middle of two parents who are divorcing! Familyfriendly perhaps but definitely films with a dark side.In this film it begins with the Middleton family being happy as can be. Their daughter Molly Temple is adored and everything seems just peachy. However over time you notice that Dr. Middleton Joel McCrea is often so wrapped up in his work that he neglects his sweet wife Elsa Rosemary Ames. It's obvious to everyone but him that his wife is lonely and needs him. Eventually she sets her eyes on the Doc's best friend Rolfe Brent Lyle Talbot and soon she and Brent are in love...and she's seeking a divorce! Molly naturally is effected by all this and eventually runs away! Will these dopey parents give up their selfish ways and make a family for Molly once again? What do you think?!Like so many of Shirley's films this one is an obvious object lesson on good parenting and the importance of family. So despite being a tiny bit traumatic it does all end well and emphasizes good old fashioned values. It is a bit of a departure though as in this one Shirley does NOT sing and the film has a much more compact plot than usual...hence its very short running time compared to her other fulllength films.

	schema:reviewBody "During this film a love quadrangle develops then dissipates at the last moment. The wife and Doctor husband love each other and have a 6 year old girlShirley but the wife feels unfulfilled now that her daughter is less dependent on her and she doesn't have a job to keep her busy. She is distraught by her cramped social life with her husband working long hours on his patients and his research. The husband's current nurse is in love with him but the husband seems not interested in her romantically although he much appreciates her. The husband's playboy friend strikes up a friendly relationship with the wife and they spend more time together mostly at sports than does the husband and wife. Eventually they imagine they are in love and make plans for a quickie divorce and marriage with Shirley living with the wife and new husband. But Shirley doesn't like her stepfathertobe partly because he doesn't know how to be a daddy. So Shirley packs up a few things and hits the road with her little dog. She comes upon a talkative tramp who inquires about her destination. She's going to her favorite picnic spot by a stream. The husband comes upon the tramp and is told where she says she's going. The wife isn't far behind. They find her unharmed enjoying her lunch and decide it's best for Shirley if they don't separate. The 3 end happily reunited.The problem with the screenplay is that nothing has been solved. The husband wife and Shirley are in the same situation they began with. So how long is their new found bliss going to last? One obvious solution is for the wife to get a job to keep her busy. But perhaps she would only be happy working as a nurse as she did before Shirley was born. But this is a small town so there may not be any openings for a nurse. Hubbie likes his current nurse and doesn't want to give her up. So perhaps they would have to move to a city to find a nursing job. Another possibility would be to have another child if this was agreeable to both. Still another possibility is to get active in several organizations.This is a very unusual S.T. film in that she has both parents all the way through. I'm surprised the Hays commission allowed this theme. I've read they frowned on divorce subjects although there was no actual divorce here. In most of Shirley's films she's an orphan or missing one of her parents. In no case I'm aware of was the parent missing because of divorce.If you want to see and hear Shirley sing and dance this isn't the right film. If you just enjoy the cute vivacious little girl this film may satisfy you.".

This must be one of her only films that give her both a father and a mother with nothing dire happening to either one of them along the way.Donald Middleton Joel McCrea is a small town doctor who let domesticity get in the way of his dreams but he is more than making up for it with countless important experiments taking him away from Elsa Rosemary Ames and little Molly. Trouble is brewing early on when Don almost misses May Saturday a picnic at idyllic Heaven's Gate where Don and Elsa first met and it is there that they meet new neighbour Ralfe Brent Lyle Talbot. Donald being as obtuse as he is keeps throwing Elsa and Ralfe together even though Ralfe comments I wouldn't like to leave my wife with me etc and Nurse Boynton Erin O'Brien Moore is only too eager to console Don.Of course Shirley Temple is the star so there are lots of cute scenes of Shirley testing a cake playing with Sniff patting little foals and enjoying the park. But strangely enough no singing except for a pretty mournful lullaby to her doll. By the time September Saturday comes around the parents are headed for the divorce court and daddy ends up taking Molly to the circus but as usual is called away to the hospital and in the confusion Molly decides to take Sniff for their own Heaven's Gate picnic. Along the way she meets a philosophical tramp J. Farrell MacDonald who ends up giving Don a lecture on what is important in life!!Joel McCrea was between contracts in 1935 hence his appearance in Our Little Girl apparently Shirley developed a big crush on him but he was seen to better advantage as yet another overworked doctor in Private Worlds. Rosemary Ames was promoted as Fox's big new star in I Believed in You 1934 but it was a disaster and Fox believed no more in Rosemary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even today it's doubtful that anyone settling down to a Temple movie will have 'accidentally' stumbled upon it whilst browsing and knows what they're letting themselves in for. Temple's vehicles are a subgenre of their own and in terms of cinematic artistry are amongst the kind of films who's best critics by far are their own core audience.The plot of OLG seems the kind of mawkish fare that Miss Curly Top was a dabhand at resolving with a starry smile and a twinkly eye  mum and dad's marriage hits the rocks divorce beckons following infidelity and Shirley is of course caught up in the middle of it all.This particular entry somewhat subverts the given formula however and throughout the film's brief hourlong running time the perspective is in the main unusually dour. Whilst we're not exactly talking 'Requiem For A Dream' there is no sanguine songanddance routine to make everything alright here. It takes a runaway Shirley one of those stockcharacter postdepression aphoristic hobos and much wincing solemnity on the part of respected Thesps McCrea and Ames to win the day.Director Robertson apparently chose not to heed WC Fields' advice regarding children and animals having already directed a version of 'Annie' in 1932 and having to contend with a lot of one and a little of the other here too.

	onyx:emotionText "Even today it's doubtful that anyone settling down to a Temple movie will have 'accidentally' stumbled upon it whilst browsing and knows what they're letting themselves in for. Temple's vehicles are a subgenre of their own and in terms of cinematic artistry are amongst the kind of films who's best critics by far are their own core audience.The plot of OLG seems the kind of mawkish fare that Miss Curly Top was a dabhand at resolving with a starry smile and a twinkly eye  mum and dad's marriage hits the rocks divorce beckons following infidelity and Shirley is of course caught up in the middle of it all.This particular entry somewhat subverts the given formula however and throughout the film's brief hourlong running time the perspective is in the main unusually dour. Whilst we're not exactly talking 'Requiem For A Dream' there is no sanguine songanddance routine to make everything alright here. It takes a runaway Shirley one of those stockcharacter postdepression aphoristic hobos and much wincing solemnity on the part of respected Thesps McCrea and Ames to win the day.Director Robertson apparently chose not to heed WC Fields' advice regarding children and animals having already directed a version of 'Annie' in 1932 and having to contend with a lot of one and a little of the other here too. One has to wonder whether there was any sadistic pleasure taken in the fabled 'dead animals' factor necessary for Temple's required tears quota which on this occasion would certainly have been higher than usual.";

This tale about a journalist mother and daughter of the builder of the dam played by Raquel Meroo  her daughter performed by Charlotte Salt and a diver acted by Michael McKell  all of them are involved into a twisted as well as terrifying intrigue begins well and grows more and more until a downbeat finale .

That is more than I can say for the 'special effects' which comprised mainly of slowmotionhow 80s and painfully clumsy green screen work. The monsters were about as scary as something out of an Ed Wood movie. I've seen toddlers make scarier monsters from playdough. The plot was neither going here nor there. It was clichd and methodical yet still managed to be quite unfathomnnable. It seems the director was writing the script spontaneously and whatever popped into his head was hastily squeezed in. This movie is an insult to anyone who may have the misfortune to endure 92 minutes of unprofessional directing poor special effects poorer acting and an altogether mediocre performance and story line. I am still very surprised that this even made it to a theater and even more surprised I didn't walk out of it halfway.

Great director good source material... what could possibly go wrong?A great many things apparently.The acting and dialogue are stilted the atmosphere which should just create itself given the setting simply isn't there and the dreadful scenechewing performance of Patrick Gordon as the villain of the piece deflates any sense of dread one may have had. Even the one decent monster effect is wasted in a brief and poorlysequenced shot. As much as it pains me to say Mr. Yuzna seems to have hit a bit of a slump.

It's a decent premise with quality production design it puts most of its respectable budget on the screen Charlotte Salt is very easy to look at and it features the most effeminate looking warlock in cinema history for some needed although probably unintentional comedy relief.The negative reaction mostly comes from an extremely weak ending and a final moronic twist that takes about 10 IQ points off the target audience. But compared to the staggeringly lame low budget garbage going direct to DVD these days Beneath Still Waters is a breathe of fresh air.Things set up nicely with an interesting flashback scene to 1965 when a damn project flooded a valley in Spain and submerged the village of Marinbad. The reason for this is slowly revealed during the first half of the film as it is tied to a supernatural force which has caused several recent deaths in the town and appears to be structurally weakening the damn on the eve of the new village's 40th anniversary celebration.The last third of the film is like a bad remake of Jaws 3D 1983 degenerating into a low budget disaster movie. Just substitute a damn a lake an effeminate warlock and a partying hard group of villagers for the Sea World glass tunnels the ocean the mean shark and a bunch of partying park guests.Salt is the best reason to watch. She has several scenes with her recently deceased grandfather's spirit which are nicely done and genuinely creepy. The special effects are not overdone and the only genuinely lame character is the village's Ed Wood type police captain.The DVD is closed captioned which is getting to be an indicator of technical quality.

	schema:reviewBody "Brian Yuzna was already responsible for some really crazy and unusual horror projects in the past some of them refreshing and original Society The Dentist and other ones unspeakably terrible Rottweiler but Beneath Still Waters is undoubtedly the most discouraging effort he was ever involved in. This film certainly doesn't look as if it were directed by someone with over twenty years of experience in the genre because the wholesome simply feels amateurish and unfinished. How can a concept holding so much horrific potential result in such a boring and incoherent mess? How can one film feature so many exquisite filming locations nauseating makeup effects and thoroughly depraved themes and still turn out a complete failure? I love macabre tales handling about sunken villages and the dark secrets that drowned with them. There are way too few films like this in the horror genre and of the two I encountered during the past year one is obscure as hell and remains unreleased on DVD to this date the modest Swiss production entitled Marmorera and the other one  this particular film  is a missed opportunity. There are a lot of things going on in Beneath Still Waters but only very little of them make sense and it seems as if Yuzna doesn't want you to care about any of the characters and the grim ordeals they are facing. The events take place in a remote Spanish village days before the great 40th anniversary celebration of the dam that prevented the area from flooding and the subsequent foundation of a brand new town called Desbaria. Few people know however the dam initially served to deliberately drown the entire town of Marienbad because all the inhabitants were gradually joining the satanic cult led by Mordecai Salas. Two ruthless boys accidentally saved Salas from a watery death right before the town sunk entirely and he has been waiting forty years now to seek revenge on the descendants of the previous mayor. So  what we have here is without exaggerating one of the most promising horror premises of the past two decades AND you can also add several dynamite sub themes like nudity childkill underwater zombies and even a totally gratuitous orgy complete with nuns and chickens! Can someone please tell me where exactly this idea went wrong? Yuzna leaps from one subject to another without paying attention to continuity and for some reason he also inserts numerous tedious elements. All the main characters are bland and of course the really wooden acting performances of the ensemble cast don't help. Most of the players appear to be dead long before their characters drown in the lake or become consumed by the living mucus  seaweed. Such a damn shame because the Spanish filming locations are genuinely ominous! For the proper grim use of picturesque Spanish villages please check out Dagon and The Nun which are both films Yuzna produced but not directed himself.".

	schema:headline " Extremely poor showing from Brian Yuzna";
	schema:reviewBody "I'd heard nothing but bad things about this film but decided to track it down anyway simply because it has so much promise. For a start it was directed by Brian Yuzna' part of the creative genius behind ReAnimator and director of horror masterpieces Society and Return of the Living Dead 3 and secondly the plot which is based on a book by Matthew Costello sounded like a great base for a horror movie. I figured that with these two elements in place things couldn't possibly be as bad as I'd heard. Well...to say things went wrong would be an understatement. The plot focuses on a Spanish village named Marienbad a place where the locals are gradually succumbing to a Satanic cult lead by a man named Mordecai Salas. Someone or other has hatched a plan involving building a dam to flood the town and it's inhabitants but the plan fails when a couple of no good kids end up freeing the cult leader before the town is engulfed in water. Fast forward forty years and the village of Desbaria stands in its place though the cult leader is waiting for his revenge.The film gets off to a really good start as we watch a couple of kids traverse across a flooded town and into a brilliantly realised Satanic church where they are greeted by a group of bewitched locals. But once this is over and we move into the present day things start to go downhill. The main problem with the film is that it's a mess. There are a handful of good ideas but they haven't been put together coherently which takes most of the credibility away from the film. The film also feels very cheap the poor acting doesn't help in this respect and neither does the turgid script which is littered with trite lines of dialogue. The film does feature some nice locations which is nice but that's really the only good thing I have to say about it. Anyone who has seen more than a few Brian Yuzna films will know that the director likes to let things descend into chaos so he can show a wave of graphic images and that happens here but it's not as good as it was in the likes of Society and really just caps off a very disappointing effort. I wouldn't hesitate to name this as Yuzna's worst alongside Faust Love of the Damned and only hardcore fans need apply.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beneath Still Waters isn't that bad at times but isn't spectacular either.SPOILERSDiving at a local spot Clara Borgia Charlotte Salt and her friends Susana Pilar Soto and Antonio Damia Plensa witness a terrible tragedy. Her mother Teresa Raquel Meroo a reporter in town on a story races to the scene and sense s another story there. Meeting up with photojournalist Dan Quarry Michael McKell they start to piece together an idea of what happened. Figuring out that the local legend where years ago a small town flooded and became the nearby lake might be more truthful than they might think. As they start getting reports of mysterious occurrences around town it's decided to stay quiet until the town's celebration of the event. Finally realizing that the spirits who died in the flooding are coming back to take revenge they race to stop them before it's too late.The Good News This was a pretty decent film overall. One of the biggest parts is that this really feels unique. While this one does feature many different clichs including black magic rituals and mysterious secrets from the past that come back to haunt the next generation this one feels relatively original. From the truth about what happened to how it comes about this one does have some really great moments that do work. Most notably is that of the town. There's some really great exploration of the buildings that cause some great jump moments and some suspense mixed in as well. This is spread throughout the whole film including the opening flashback the vision inside the kitchen which qualifies as the best scene in the film and the ending footchase through the fogcovered woods which is extremely atmospheric quite suspenseful and incredibly entertaining by itself. That it takes a long time to wind through isn't a bad mark since that allows for plenty of meets and confrontations driving up both the action and suspense waiting for the next one to occur. The other part that really works for the film is that there's some really nice gore to be found. There's a couple of faces pulled apart a severed hand Achilles heels sliced into a neck bitten into and having a propeller cut into the body and leaving gashes all over the chest and stomach. All of these help the film out.The Bad News There isn't a whole lot really wrong with this one. One problem is the completely confusing storyline. This has a great habit of throwing in scenes that don't make any sense at all. This one throws in plenty of scenes that don't make sense and are thrown together simply because of their creep factor. Had this one decided to give a sense of conformity to everything instead of simply because of how the setpiece works then this could've been easily avoided as a little explanation given as to what's going on would go a long way. The other flaw is that the film has a tendency to resort to clichs far too often. The entire premise regarding the sins of the fathers bearing down against the sons to the mysterious stranger and many more scenes and themes are all from the past in the film. While not the most original concept this one does give it a chance as it really just drowns in all the clichs stacked against it. That coupled with the extremely confusing story lower this one.The Final Verdict Had this fixed a few small problems then it wouldn't be all that bad and might've been a thoroughly underrated film. Though there's still more positives present there isn't a whole lot to recommend this one to those who have an intense love for these since the flaws will be striking this one down.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Nudity and mild sex scenes".

The previews of it mad me so excited but the actually movie was a let down. Save your self the time and don't watch it. Everything could have been fine if it chose a side. Horror or Suspense pick one. The few moment of terror were cool but they happened only a few times. There was a TON of story build up and character development perfect for a suspense movie.".

The script by Mike Hostench  Angel Sala was based on a novel by Matthew Costello  one has to say it's a bit of a mess which is a shame because the basic story of a ghostly underwater town is something different  had lots of potential but sadly this is what we ended up with.

There's some decent gore here there's some really cool looking rotting zombies there are decapitated heads  severed limbs the main villain like to rip peoples heads in half someone chest bursts open someone saws their own legs  hand off  there are also various other minor bits of blood  gore throughout although the murder of Luis seemed cut as there are noticeable jumps in the audio  too many 'reaction' shots of Teresa  Dan even though seemingly nothing has happened.Technically the film is alright but nothing special it looks OK but doesn't really have any style or atmosphere  it's definitely not scary. The acting isn't great.Beneath Still Waters is a pretty poor film it had potential  an original  intriguing premise but it makes nothing of it.

There were a couple underwater shots that didn't quite measure up to the rest of the film and being that the actors had different nationalities some of the performances came off as uneven due to the language barrier. Most of this was shot in English from what I could tell although the boys' in the opening sequence may have been dubbed. Now on to the overwhelming majority which was good. The villain was creepy and the actor gave a spectacular performance. The story was fascinating and the sets and makeup effects were the stuff of horror classics. There was a time after the excellent opening that I was leaning more towards putting this film in the interesting but deeply flawed category Rottweiler and Faust are in but ultimately for me the good far outweighed the bad.

But they weren't alone and discover something quite horrific about those people who have been left to drown. Foolishly one of the lads unleashes the evil. We travel 40 years into the present and the town is celebrating its damn's anniversary but the evil that had plagued its community many decades ago is back lurking in the waters. So it's up to a local TV reporter and outoftown photographer to stop this evil from resurfacing.If it wasn't for the name Brian Yuzna being tagged to the project I probably wouldn't have bothered. Well after watching it. It didn't matter either way. Has Yuzna hit rock bottom after the dreadful Rottweiler and incredibly bland Beneath Still Waters? I hope not as his been apart of a few greatly creative horror flicks and lets hope the next Reanimator film doesn't follow the same suit of his latest two. The main problem with the Spanish production Beneath Still Waters is that the script is insipidly onenote and the ploddingly colourless screenplay which is taken off Matthew Costello's novel just doesn't know what its wants to be and goes in so many different directions without any sort of gelling chemistry. The dark concept is a compellingly spooky one but they tried for something too ambitious here and never captured the tenor that would've made it worked. What starts off like an atmospherically stimulating and morbidly eerie opening few minutes eventually falls into a systematically mundane and just plain silly outing that loses it ominous air and brooding suspense it began with. The mysterious story starts to feel secondary and becomes convoluted when the lousily questionable digital effects poorly staged underwater scenes and competently unpleasant gore fx and grotesque special makeup effects take over. These profound latter moments are fine and all in well but when it keeps you waiting around with drably uninteresting characters and a confusing parade of predictable though there one moment that's notso ideas. From this format it can just lead to a complete and utter drag for most part because of too little action. Gladly it does spice up things in the perversely shocking but horrendously ridiculous latter half. Throwing gratuitous gore violence skin and lust. Maybe it comes to late? Yuzna does stamp his trademark directorial style. Even then it can't hide how unevenly lumpy his execution is. Sometimes he can go overthetop but suddenly fall into a lethargic puddle. But he does stage few imaginative and effective setpieces with nice brushes in lighting composition. The film is actually technically good and Johnny Yebra's handsomely shot cinematography and the pristinely haunting and saturated Spanish locations do come through. The routine musical score is basically nonexistent in creating any sense of mood and falls flat. The acting mostly a Spanish cast is either elastically ripe or lackadaisical. Raquel Merono looks stunning but won't win anything for her humdrum performance and English actor Michael Mckell is acceptably soso in the leading parts. Patrick Gordon's mishandled performance as supernatural entity just doesn't seem to reek of any uncomfortable menace and takes up too much screen time to be effective any shape. Diana Pealver from Braindead shows up in a small part.In the long run this cheaply produced bflick by Fantastic Factory simply bites off more than it could chew. I don't think this picture is completely deadbeat but the bad points do seem to outweigh the good.".

That's taking in quite a bit of territory because Fonda did some dreadful stuff in the seventies like Tentaccoli with a giant octopus. A lot of this was done for the money and Fonda with five wives certainly had much expenses in alimony.But Immortal Sergeant held a place dear in his heart because of the head of 20th Century Fox Darryl F. Zanuck. Back in 1940 in order to get the part of Tom Joad Fonda made a faustian deal with Zanuck signing his only studio contract. The studio cast him in what he considered junk. The good films he made in that four year stretch were on loan out to Paramount for The Lady Eve to Warner Brothers for The Male Animal to RKO for The Big Street. He was not fond of what Fox cast him in for the most part because he got what was left after Tyrone Power and Don Ameche rejected it.Anyway come 1943 Fonda had two objectives to make The Oxbow Incident because he knew that would be a classic and to enlist in World War II as pal Jimmy Stewart did. He prevailed on Zanuck to do The Oxbow Incident and it was a cheaply made western classic though it was because it was shot completely on the sound stage. Then Zanuck cajoled begged and pleaded with him to make this one more film which he said was a great propaganda piece one that would tear the hearts of the movie going public and rally the homefront and be an inspiration to the fighting troops.When Immortal Sergeant proved somewhat less than that Fonda felt hoodwinked and gritted his teeth and finished the film. He tried in fact to enlist to get out of it and Zanuck had so much pull in Washington DC Fonda kept getting his enlistment postponed.It was one angry Henry Fonda who finished The Immortal Sergeant and then went to war. His experience with this film made him bound and determined to get out of his contract one way or another. Ultimately he left Hollywood in 1948 when he got a great Broadway role in Mister Roberts. Fonda didn't return to Hollywood until 1955 and then to make the screen version of Mister Roberts.But that's getting away from Immortal Sergeant. Without Henry Fonda's rather colored viewpoint of the situation let me say it's not the worst World War II flag waver the studios put out. As is usual Henry Fonda is a Canadian to explain his nonBritish speech who has enlisted in the British army and is serving in North Africa. He's a young man with a lot of angst and when his patrol's sergeant is killed Fonda has to summon something from within to bring the men back to their lines.Thomas Mitchell is the sergeant and Maureen O'Hara is Fonda's girl back home and both do a creditable job. For the rest of his life Fonda would foam at the mention of Immortal Sergeant. Being the professional he was he did a good job in the film.But Immortal Sergeant hardly belongs in the same company as The Oxbow Incident and Mister Roberts in the works of Henry Fonda.".

	schema:headline " Lost Patrol";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those movies about a handful of soldiers lost in the desert who must find and fight their way home. But if the plot is familiar this is a pretty well executed example.Combat aside it's the story of the maturation of Henry Fonda the bashful receding passive loner of a corporal who suddenly finds himself in charge when his sergeant is killed. Fonda's character has what psychologists call a primary trait. That is he is excessively something or other. It's the part of him that everyone notices. Whenever we do a statistical analysis of personality characteristics one of the first to show up is likely to be introversionextraversion and Fonda is high on introversion. This is one of the Big Five personality traits if anyone wants to bother looking it up. There are numerous flashback too involving Fonda's selfeffacing quality interfering with his relationship with Maureen O'Hara. He can't bring himself to declare his love for her and meanwhile the gregarious Reginald Gardner just the opposite high on extraversion is taking his place. These kinds of back stories are usually annoying but in this case I can bring myself to forgive them because Maureen O'Hara at twentytwo is sublime. Not pretty in any ordinary way. If you asked an artist to sit down and draw a picture of a beautiful woman it wouldn't come out looking like O'Hara. Her nose is more like an eagle's than like a ski slope. And her chin is a little larger than would be required to accommodate her lips. And she's not even a phenomenally talented actress. Really a performance by an actor is made up half of demands imposed by the script and half by the organismic variables the actor brings to the role. And O'Hara's gestures at enacting the role of the girl friend back home are so perfunctory that we readily sense the real person beneath  and she's radiant. So anyway okay. She can stay in the film.I first saw this years ago on KVZK and remembered it only for O'Hara's presence and for a scene in which a disabled Italian aircraft crashes into a truck full of British soldiers. I just saw it again and those two are still its most outstanding features.The combat scenes are well done for the time too. It's exciting as well as thoughtful. I wouldn't blame anyone for disliking it because it's just another phony war movie with romantic flashbacks but in my opinion although it is that it's something more as well. It might have been called How To Conquer Your Introversion and been written by a mediasavvy politician.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of those movies about a handful of soldiers lost in the desert who must find and fight their way home. But if the plot is familiar this is a pretty well executed example.Combat aside it's the story of the maturation of Henry Fonda the bashful receding passive loner of a corporal who suddenly finds himself in charge when his sergeant is killed. Fonda's character has what psychologists call a primary trait. That is he is excessively something or other. It's the part of him that everyone notices. Whenever we do a statistical analysis of personality characteristics one of the first to show up is likely to be introversionextraversion and Fonda is high on introversion. This is one of the Big Five personality traits if anyone wants to bother looking it up. There are numerous flashback too involving Fonda's selfeffacing quality interfering with his relationship with Maureen O'Hara. He can't bring himself to declare his love for her and meanwhile the gregarious Reginald Gardner just the opposite high on extraversion is taking his place. These kinds of back stories are usually annoying but in this case I can bring myself to forgive them because Maureen O'Hara at twentytwo is sublime. Not pretty in any ordinary way. If you asked an artist to sit down and draw a picture of a beautiful woman it wouldn't come out looking like O'Hara. Her nose is more like an eagle's than like a ski slope. And her chin is a little larger than would be required to accommodate her lips. And she's not even a phenomenally talented actress. Really a performance by an actor is made up half of demands imposed by the script and half by the organismic variables the actor brings to the role.

I am not sure why The Big Street wasn't his least favorite it was godawful believe me but he disliked it. And I might add my wife wasn't superfond a this film as we watched it. However I really thought it was pretty good...though I do wonder if the main character played by Fonda might have been schizophrenicthat's because throughout the film he keeps hearing the voice of his sergeanteven though the guy is dead!The film is a WWII propaganda film. Because of this it's main thrust is NOT realism but to bolster folks' support of the war effort. I cut the film a bit of slack as it was 1943 and keeping up morale was a major concern. What I didn't like was the casting of Fonda as he was supposed to be a Britand seemed about as British as John Wayne or Hattie McDaniel! In this sense I could see why he didn't like playing this rolebut the plot is pretty good and more than makes up for this.The sergeant in the title is played by Thomas Mitchelland he's very good in this role. This guy is a career soldier and seems indestructible to his menand he is adored by them. However although he seems to have all the answers his corporal Fonda seems quite differentunsure of himself and not at all the soldier Mitchell is. But when the sergeant is killed and Fonda is left in charge of a small group of men in the North African desert he's given a chance to show his mettle.In many ways this film is a lot like the film Saharathough Sahara is a much more enjoyable and less realistic film. Both are set in the same locale and are about a small group of soldiers overcoming greater numbers of enemy soldiers. But the casting and script just weren't quite as good herethough the film STILL is enjoyable and did what the studio wanted it to do. I also appreciate how the men in this film were NOT indestructiblemany died even though you KNEW how it all had to end. Not brilliant but quite entertaining.".

The first version I can recall was the Lost Patrol a 1929 British silent film remade in 1934 by John Ford. Those films were based on the 1927 novel Patrol and the basic theme has been repeated since e.g. 'The Thirteen Sahara Last of the Comanches Kokoda.This 1943 film is an American propaganda film using the British fighting in Africa for the setting. Though this is obviously a studio film the camera work is pretty good and some of the action sequences look good.The cast is rich with 40s stars like Henry Fonda Thomas Mitchell Maureen O'Hara and Reginald Gardiner. But they are merely going through the motions and there is nothing here you haven't seen before.My favorite WW 2 fighting films made between 1942 and 1944 include Wake Island 1942 Bataan 1943 which also had Mitchell The Fighting Sullivans 1944 Flying Tigers 1942 Guadalcanal Diary 1943 The North Star 1943 The Rats of Tobruk 1944 and Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo 1944.There are a plethora of nonfighting WW 2 films that are worthy of mention  Casablanca 1942 Lifeboat 1944 Hangmen Also Die 1943 and Five Graves to Cairo 1943.".

Michael Caine stars as Jack Carter a tough no nonsense operator in the London underworld who returns to his home town of Newcastle Upon Tyne when his brother turns up dead. Directed and adapted to screenplay by Mike Hodges from Ted Lewis' novel Jack's Return Home Get Carter is a bleakly atmospheric masterwork that takes the period setting of the time and blends harsh realism with film noir sensibilities and filters it through an uncut prism of doom.Jack Carter as created by Caine and Hodges is the quintessential film noir antihero. He smokes French cigarettes and reads Raymond Chandler there is no hiding the respect and homages to classical noir pulsing away as Jack goes on his not so merry way. He's a vengeful angel of death but sexy as hell with it he even has humorous pearls of wisdom to spout delivered with relish by Caine who is at his snake eyed best.In a strange quirk of the narrative Jack is home but he's a fish out of water he's a suited and booted Cockney lad moving amongst the flotsam and jetsam of North Eastern society. It's a crumbling landscape of terraced houses and coal yards of seedy clubs and bed and breakfast establishments where as Jack wryly observes the beds have seen untold action.Jack Carter is a hard bastard borderline psychotic once his mind has tuned into the frequency that plays to him the tunes of mistrust of doubledealings liars and thieves of pornographers and gangsters who thrive on gaining wealth while the society around them falls into a depression. It's Fog on the Tyne for sure here. Yet Jack is not devoid of heartfelt emotion his family ties are strong and there is a point in the film when Jack sheds a tear it is then when we all know that all bets are off and there will be no coming back from this particular abyss.Hodges and cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky strip it all back for maximum impact so much so you can smell the salt of the murky sea feel your lungs filling up with chimney smoke the whiff of working class sweat is all around and all the time Roy Budd's contemporary musical score jingles and jangles over proceedings like a dance of death waiting to reach its operatic conclusion. And with Caine backed up by a roll call of super working class character actors Get Carter just gets better as each decade of film making passes.Like its antagonistprotagonist yes Jack is both a deliberate contradiction it's a film as hard as nails where home format releases should be delivered through your letterboxes in a metal case. No lover of film noir can have an excuse to have not seen it yet. Funny sexy brutal and not without a ticking time bomb of emotional fortitude as well Get Carter is the A Bomb in Grey Street. 1010".

	schema:headline " A Masterpiece of Grittiness";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of Caine's best roles and undoubtedly one of the greatest gangstercrime films ever made. It is unrelentingly harsh gritty and bleak in showing the nasty world of Carter. Few characters are truly likable or admirable and most have a mix of good and bad. This applies to Carter himself and even the bystanders or victims. Everyone is portrayed as flawed somehow even those who are tragic. This is one of many aspects that adds to the realism of this film.This grittiness is true not only of the world of crime but the entire world of the early postindustrial Northern England once at the forefront of the industrial revolution but by then a depressed backwater that had yet to feel the true benefits of recent social and economic changes. It thus provides some subtle social commentary as well although one may easily miss it. In addition to its raw grittiness the film is also very intense. There is a building tension throughout and a palpable that things are not right. At the same time the events in particular the action and violence are rather slow but relentless.In fact the way the film presents the violence and action is one of the keys to its greatness. It is an unusual fascinating and very powerful depiction. There isn't gore or even lots of blood or the like and like the rest of the film it generally progresses slowly and calmly. It's not exhilarating or glamorous but instead deliberate relentless and above all cold. The coldness of the violence and how Carter in particular but others as well kill and hurt in an unfeeling perfunctory manner makes it seem all the more harsh.Another interesting aspect of the film is the juxtaposition of the idea that someone can force or change events around him against the feeling that one can merely react to events beyond his control. Both of these themes seem to clash in Carter and his actions for one of these themes may at times appear to be what's happening yet in the end it seems that the other exerts its dominance. Ultimately this is superb extremely gritty and powerful drama. It contains action and violence but it is not an action film and most expecting a nonstop action film with flashy fighting getting the bad guys etc. may well be bored.".

	schema:reviewBody "Get Carter is often said to have inspired the current crop of British gangster films. If this is the case Guy Ritchie et al must have well and truly got the wrong end of the stick. I haven't actually seen Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or any of the Right Royal Cockney Barrel O'Monkeys type films which followed it but I get the impression that these are merely dumb entertainment for new lads. In contrast Get Carter is unremittingly bleak. If Samuel Beckett wrote a gangster film it might come out something like this. The grim Newcastle locations add to an atmosphere of decay and despair. The naturalistic camera work avoids cliches and adds effectively to the atmosphere. Long static shots give the impression of actually being present as a bewildered bystander as the gangsters go about their business. Although the long tracking shots of people walkingrunning are almost pythonesque at times this only serves to emphasise the down to earth realism of the film. After all even violent gangsters have to go through banal routines such as walking down the street. The score is minimalist but very effective in contrast to the modern British films which seem to be conceived as a gravy train for music publishers and second rate indie bands.There are few if any sympathetic characters. Jack Carter the central character is not at all pleasant or heroic. The only people for whom he shows any affection are Frank and Doreen and he is unable to express this affection except through money and violence. Keith thinks he is Carter's friend but when he is let down and beaten up he realises that he is being used. Carter does not appear to love Anna and it is not certain whether she really loves him although there is a genuine sexual attraction between them. Carter belongs to a misogynistic and hypocritical culture which the film scathingly exposes. The only scene in which he shows any genuine emotion is when he discovers a porn film featuring his niece Doreen. The cruel irony is that in the opening scene he was seen looking at dirty pictures with his cronies and his disgust must be partly directed at himself even though he refuses to acknowledge it. He then expresses his shock and outrage by going straight upstairs to assault and humiliate the nearest woman! And she just happens to have appeared in the very same film as Doreen a clear case of men projecting their own sexual guilt onto women. The makers of the film cannot have been unaware of the implications of this sexual hypocrisy. The scenes are deliberately juxtaposed to emphasise Carter's ambivalence and double standards.The certainties of a linear narrative have been bravely eschewed. Carter is only able to react to events which are beyond his control and is sometimes led up blind alleys taking a long time to realise what is really going on. This again is realism at its best. Real life does not have a coherent plot and nobody has complete control over their own life. Carter's lack of control is a central theme of the film. He likes to think that he is big hard and clever but his acts of revenge are ultimately pointless. Like Frank Machin in This Sporting Life he is emotionally shallow and able to express himself only through futile acts of aggression. He is cruelly exposed in the final scene as the smile is wiped off his face the closing shot of the sea emphasising man's powerlessness.The film also contains elements of social comment and class politics. Frank is portrayed as a decent honest salt of the earth working class type while the slimy and sinister Kinnear has a chauffeur and lives in a big house in the country where he hosts decadent orgies. These themes come to the fore in the often overlooked funeral scene. As Frank's small cortege pulls through the gates of the crematorium we see an endless stream of cars leaving from the previous funeral. The message is that the liberation of the 60s brought few practical benefits for working class people in the north of England. Again this relates to the dominant theme of control or lack of it. The swinging 60s are exposed as a dead end of pointless hedonism. The extent of women's liberation is also questioned. Get Carter portrays a society in which women are not at all liberated except in a few superficial ways. The female characters in the film are all victims owned and used by men who see them as sex objects and little more. It is implied that the sexual freedom brought by the contraceptive pill has benefited men more than women.It's not all angst and depression though. There is some good fighting swearing shooting and dangerous driving. There are also many subtle touches of black humour. Nevertheless this is not a mindless action film. The consequences of violence are never ignored or glossed over. We are shown Keith lying on his bed in agony after getting a severe beating leaving us in no doubt that his brief flirtation with gangsters has ruined his life.Get Carter is a masterpiece although it will not be to everyone's taste. If you want nonstop action try a mindless Arnold Schwarzeneger film. There is nothing for you here. However if you are prepared to approach Get Carter with an open mind and think about it rather than be a passive observer demanding to be entertained you will find a rewarding work of art with hidden depths.  Forget Guy Ritchie. The only worthy successor of Get Carter is Neil Jordan's Mona Lisa which addresses similar themes and is equally bleak and disturbing.".

He's a career criminal a gangster in London whose brother was in Newcastle his hometown when he found out that he died under mysterious circumstances. Already we're on his side since it was obviously not a typical drunkdriving accident that caused Frank Carter's death and we want to see revenge andor justice. But Jack Carter that man with a nearpermanent dour look on his face and a tendency to get violent isn't a typical protagonist. He's something of an antihero a nasty one at that who is a perpetual womanizer in one oddly hot scene he talks with a direct tone on the phone with a gangster's moll to take off her clothes and masturbate and will hurt anyone he needs to sometimes to extreme lengths to get what he needs to know.Certainly he's surrounded in a murky enough criminal environment. The Newcastle of 'Get Carter' is a place with sleazy gangsters betting big bucks and nightclubs with oftheperiod music and women running hotels with weathered looks on their faces. It's here that Carter goes on his investigation like a hardboiled detective without mercy. And as he digs deeper into what is at the heart of the mystery that Frank Carter wasn't a saint but got duped by the criminal elements and in a pornographic film that brings Jack to tears of rage it becomes clear he'll have to knock a few heads and shoot when he must... which is a lot.Carter might be more unlikable if not for the star in the role. Michael Caine has a look to him in this film that recalls Alain Delon in the JeanPierre Melville pictures specifically Le Samourai. Nothing can really flinch this guy unless it's something that he actually cares about. But Caine gives humanity to a character that is on the move almost always and has to be on his toes when around unsavory characters. I loved seeing how Caine can just be great at looking around a room or a situation or looking over a person and how when he gets angry boy you better get out even if or sometimes especially because you're a woman not dishing on what needs to be told. Caine helps a film that needs that star quality other actors like John Osbourne as the Big Gangster Kinnear and Ian Hendry as Eric do well enough if only good performances and where the film digs into some subversive dark terrain we have to keep watching it to see how Caine can pull it off.Another perk for Hodges is how he deals with the action. Often his film will feel a little slowgoing never too boring but of a time period the 70's when a story could take a little more time in establishing mood but when action and violence come up it's genuinely shocking and thrilling. We expect to get some satisfaction seeing Carter getting his payback at the criminals but here there's a dastardly twist as to how just rotten Carter can be with these figures. He goes to their level and Hodges lets us go along for the wicked neonoir ride. Some may find it too dark or just a little too unrelentingly bleak with what Carter finds and how he gets his revenge. But there's the bittersweet part to it as well especially in the last act that makes it worthwhile.".

	schema:reviewBody "Strongman and enforcer Jack Carter Michael Caine returns to his native North East of England to investigate the suspicious death of his brother. Here he encounter a world of sleaze booze violence casual sex and people in search of easy money.Hard to call it a classic early British gangster film given that they were so few around but more a cracking thriller that makes full use of its cast plot and unusual Newcastle Upon Tyne location.WriterDirector Mike Hodges wanted violence with reality and he delivers it with real punch. Unlike most thrillers bystanders are not immune from the action and at various stages harsh punishment is handed out for minor crimes by antihero Caine.Caine underplays his hardman role nicely  letting the action rather than his emotions tell the story.Several people claim reallife events inspired this story but as far as I can tell the only direct reference to real events is that the onearm bandit business started to earn big money in the North East and London gangsters wanted in.

	onyx:emotionText "Strongman and enforcer Jack Carter Michael Caine returns to his native North East of England to investigate the suspicious death of his brother. Here he encounter a world of sleaze booze violence casual sex and people in search of easy money.Hard to call it a classic early British gangster film given that they were so few around but more a cracking thriller that makes full use of its cast plot and unusual Newcastle Upon Tyne location.WriterDirector Mike Hodges wanted violence with reality and he delivers it with real punch. Unlike most thrillers bystanders are not immune from the action and at various stages harsh punishment is handed out for minor crimes by antihero Caine.Caine underplays his hardman role nicely  letting the action rather than his emotions tell the story.Several people claim reallife events inspired this story but as far as I can tell the only direct reference to real events is that the onearm bandit business started to earn big money in the North East and London gangsters wanted in. That lead to bloodshed but that is not the thrust of this film  although one of the main characters is indeed in that business.Having gone to the trouble of reading the screenplay I was surprised how thin the dialogue was. This is a good example of how it is better to show things rather than tell.

And this isn't because we want to be like Jack Carter far from it. It may be because there is a kind of catharsis to be gained from the fact that the bad people in this film have made the mistake in choosing the people they have made victims Jack Carter's brother and niece  assumed to be innocents  have as an avenger someone who is worse than the villains who have killedcorrupted them.Every performance here is first rate but Michael Caine's Jack Carter  deadly cold and malevolent even when he is at his most charming  is a stunning creation. The industrial northern locations are as bleak as the story and the final sequence with Jack pursuing Ian Hendry's Eric is as gripping as anything in cinema right up until its last shocking moment. Roy Budd's spare score is just right and Mike Hodges' direction is superb.But this is Caine's film and after Alfie it is probably the film which did most to confirm his position as a class act.".

	schema:headline " ...before Carter gets you!";
	schema:reviewBody "It used to be the case that movies did not play on British television until five years after their original release. 'Get Carter'  1971  appeared on I.T.V. in 1976. Producer Michael Klinger complained Its not right that they should buy a film and then cut it about.. He had a point. So much of the swearing nudity and violence had been removed that it looked tamer than 'Dixon Of Dock Green'. Unfortunately this emasculated version was the one British viewers were stuck with for the next fifteen years until Alex Cox's 'Moviedrome' series on B.B.C.2 finally showed an uncut print.Based on the brilliant novel 'Jack's Return Home' by Ted Lewis the film tells the story of Jack Carter  Michael Caine  a hoodlum who returns to his native Newcastle to find out why his brother Frank died. As soon as he steps off the train he is plunged into a nightmare world of corruption pornography and violence. Frank had been working for fleshpeddler Cyril Kinnear  playwright John Osbourne . Kinnear has a rival in the shape of Cliff Brumby  Bryan Mosley . Surviving numerous attempts to either rough him up or kill him outright Carter then discovers his niece Doreen  Petra Markham  had starred in one of Kinnear's porn flicks. He goes ballistic  the girl was actually his illegitimate daughter  and one death follows another culminating in a tense showdown on a beach with Kinnear's creepy henchman Eric  Ian Hendry ...'Get Carter' presented criminals as they actually are  low life scum. It feels at times like a revenge Western set in the north of England  when he goes into a pub faces turn to look at him . But Caine's character is no hero in fact he's every bit as nasty as those he opposes. He verges on the robotic at times but this works in the film's favour as his explosion of fury near the end is all the more powerful  I was amazed to see another reviewer lambasting him for being 'unlikeable'! He is meant to be! . Caine is marvellous as is the rest of the cast which includes Bernard Hepton George Sewell Tony Beckley Terence Rigby Alun Armstrong Godfrey Quigley and the sexy Geraldine Moffatt. Britt Ekland has a small but memorable role as 'Anna' the girlfriend of Carter's current employer with whom he is having an affair and who masturbates while talking to Carter on the phone  another scene I.T.V. saw fit to remove . Ian Hendry did not get on well with the star  he felt 'Carter' should have been offered to him first  and the animosity helps the movie. The locations are well used particularly the multistorey car park  which I understand no longer exists  pubs racing track waterfront and so on. At Frank's funeral there is a wonderful shot of hearses speeding down a hill with factory chimneys belching smoke in the distance.Did I hear someone referring to the film's 'dated feel'? Well that is time's fault not the film's. The B.B.C.'s 'Life On Mars' series bent over backwards to try and recapture the same atmosphere.Though a hit in Britain 'Get Carter' was put on the bottom half of a double bill in America with 'Dirty Dingus Magee' a dreadful 'comedy' Western starring Frank Sinatra. Audiences stayed away in droves. In 2000 however Sylvester Stallone starred in an American remake with Caine as 'Brumby'. It tried to make Carter likable and brought in an unnecessary 'happy ending'. The film flopped.In 2010 the original's reputation is intact. It stands up to repeated viewing incredibly well  as soon as Carter's train thunders into the tunnel and Roy Budd's marvellous theme tune kicks in you're well and truly hooked . Mike Hodges who wrote and directed deserves credit for this the best British movie of the '70's.".

	onyx:emotionText "It used to be the case that movies did not play on British television until five years after their original release. 'Get Carter'  1971  appeared on I.T.V. in 1976. Producer Michael Klinger complained Its not right that they should buy a film and then cut it about.. He had a point. So much of the swearing nudity and violence had been removed that it looked tamer than 'Dixon Of Dock Green'. Unfortunately this emasculated version was the one British viewers were stuck with for the next fifteen years until Alex Cox's 'Moviedrome' series on B.B.C.2 finally showed an uncut print.Based on the brilliant novel 'Jack's Return Home' by Ted Lewis the film tells the story of Jack Carter  Michael Caine  a hoodlum who returns to his native Newcastle to find out why his brother Frank died. As soon as he steps off the train he is plunged into a nightmare world of corruption pornography and violence. Frank had been working for fleshpeddler Cyril Kinnear  playwright John Osbourne . Kinnear has a rival in the shape of Cliff Brumby  Bryan Mosley . Surviving numerous attempts to either rough him up or kill him outright Carter then discovers his niece Doreen  Petra Markham  had starred in one of Kinnear's porn flicks. He goes ballistic  the girl was actually his illegitimate daughter  and one death follows another culminating in a tense showdown on a beach with Kinnear's creepy henchman Eric  Ian Hendry ...'Get Carter' presented criminals as they actually are  low life scum. It feels at times like a revenge Western set in the north of England  when he goes into a pub faces turn to look at him . But Caine's character is no hero in fact he's every bit as nasty as those he opposes. He verges on the robotic at times but this works in the film's favour as his explosion of fury near the end is all the more powerful  I was amazed to see another reviewer lambasting him for being 'unlikeable'! He is meant to be! . Caine is marvellous as is the rest of the cast which includes Bernard Hepton George Sewell Tony Beckley Terence Rigby Alun Armstrong Godfrey Quigley and the sexy Geraldine Moffatt. Britt Ekland has a small but memorable role as 'Anna' the girlfriend of Carter's current employer with whom he is having an affair and who masturbates while talking to Carter on the phone  another scene I.T.V. saw fit to remove . Ian Hendry did not get on well with the star  he felt 'Carter' should have been offered to him first  and the animosity helps the movie. The locations are well used particularly the multistorey car park  which I understand no longer exists  pubs racing track waterfront and so on. At Frank's funeral there is a wonderful shot of hearses speeding down a hill with factory chimneys belching smoke in the distance.Did I hear someone referring to the film's 'dated feel'? Well that is time's fault not the film's. The B.B.C.'s 'Life On Mars' series bent over backwards to try and recapture the same atmosphere.Though a hit in Britain 'Get Carter' was put on the bottom half of a double bill in America with 'Dirty Dingus Magee' a dreadful 'comedy' Western starring Frank Sinatra. Audiences stayed away in droves. In 2000 however Sylvester Stallone starred in an American remake with Caine as 'Brumby'. It tried to make Carter likable and brought in an unnecessary 'happy ending'. The film flopped.In 2010 the original's reputation is intact. It stands up to repeated viewing incredibly well  as soon as Carter's train thunders into the tunnel and Roy Budd's marvellous theme tune kicks in you're well and truly hooked . Mike Hodges who wrote and directed deserves credit for this the best British movie of the '70's.";

	schema:reviewBody "If there can be anything such as a 'generic genre' then the great British gangster film must be it. But don't blame Get Carter for this blame Madge's husband Guy Ritchie. I saw Get Carter again recently and it must be the least dated film from the seventies ever made. This is largely because the situations characters settings and even fashions are so slice of life. It's a lot more convincing than a lot of the Sean Penn stuff at the moment and even hyperreal stuff like Gummo or Julian Donkey Boy. I think this is because there's no exaggeration in Get Carter. It's not shot in some weird hicky town in the middle of nowhere it's shot in Newcastle one of the UK's major cities. And Get Carter tells it like it is. It is this nononsense style that still makes it look one of the coolest films around. Also there aren't any heroes which is a good thing. Well how many 'heroes' have you met? Carter though no hero is a great character make no mistake about that and he shows just enough emotion for the audience to identify with him like when he stumbles across his dead brother's daughter in some seedy porn film and the whole motivation for his revenge mission in the first place. But he is a cold blooded killer too hardened by London's gangland and violence is his main emotional outlet in everything else  sex etc  he's pretty cool. It's not just the killers he's after it's anyone even associated with it. And he dispatches them with a passion. I know you didn't kill him!! I know!! and Goodbye !! being two memorable sign offs. I really do believe this is a better film than Godfather. Godfather exists in a world most of us will never experience and is one of the best Hollywood films. Get Carter though exists in our world and the superb characters acting and writing make it totally believable  even when Michael Caine walks naked out of the door of his seedy B  B with his shotgun to escort out some local hoods the most memorable thing you remember about the scene is the previously belligerent moaning old lady neighbour scurrying into her house terrified. Oh and Budd's soundtrack is pure sleazy brilliance well up to the standard of virtually everything else about the film.".

After failing to gather any more information from Frank's daughter Doreen Petra Markham or his mistress Margaret Dorothy White Jack goes to the local racecourse where he meets one of his old contacts a chauffeur called Eric Paice Ian Hendry who proves to be very unhelpful.

This proves to be false information and a little while later a couple of thugs working for the Fletcher brothers call by with the intention of taking Jack back to London. The two men decide to leave promptly however when Jack threatens them with a shotgun but turn up again at a different location when Jack's in the middle of a conversation with the uncooperative Margaret. On this occasion Jack makes a rapid escape and the chase that follows ends well for him when Glenda picks him up in her sports car and drives him at great speed to meet Brumby on the top floor of a multistorey car park.The information that Brumby discloses at this point enables Jack to start unravelling the mystery of what had happened to Frank an provides the catalyst for the series of killings that follow.Get Carter contains a number of memorable scenes such as the one in which Brumby is thrown off the top of a multistorey car park the sequences during which Jack and his landlady are interrupted in flagrante delicto and the powerful finale. Overall there's an unremitting bleakness that permeates all the action and is well complemented by some of the grimlooking outside locations and the action that takes place in the drab bingo hall a smokefilled pub and the grubby betting shop.Jack Carter returned to his hometown to avenge the death of his brother despite the fact that he never liked Frank and knew that the Fletchers and the Newcastle mob both disapproved of his actions because of the threat he posed to the smooth running of their businesses. Michael Caine in a very controlled performance shows convincingly how driven callous and ruthless Jack is and also how abusive he is in his relationships with a series of women. The quality of the supporting cast is also very impressive with very solid contributions from everyone involved.".

	schema:reviewBody "British cinema in the early seventies threw up a clutch of gritty urban gangster movies  including Villain with Richard Burton and the crucially underrated Sitting Target with Oliver Reed. The definitive example of the genre is clearly Mike Hodges Get Carter. The plot involves Michael Caine's Jack Carter a snakeeyed London heavy travelling back to his industrialised hellhole of a hometown to investigate the death of his brother who expired in suspicious circumstances.Caine gives his most iconic performance. Forget Alfie this is the defining moment in his acting career. Jack Carter is a ferocious violent amoral hit man ready to explode at the slightest hint of provocation. He is singleminded obsessive and completely devoid of any consideration or compassion regarding his own life or the lives of others. The only emotions he displays are anger and a terrifyingly controlled aggression. The single deviation from his emotional nihilism comes in one key scene when he realises that his niece who is probably his daughter has been brutally exploited and coerced into appearing in a hardcore porn film. There is a brief glimpse of humanity as he weeps silently  but it doesn't last for long. In seconds he hardens and physically assaults the hooker who costarred in the film until she gives him information. This leads to him locking her into the trunk of a sports car and later watching dispassionately as it is dumped into a river  with her still in it.Caine's performance is a revelation  framed as a sadistic avenging angel carving a path of death and mayhem in pursuit of justice for a brother he didn't care for and a daughter and family he has hardly ever seen or had any contact with. Motivation for his behaviour can only stem from the pointlessness of his own existence a cold hollow life violent and joyless devoid of love and comfort. He sets out to do something and do it he does whatever the cost fulfilling his own death wish in the process. Carter is a man who knows where his actions will lead yet doesn't care. The term antihero just cannot come anywhere close to accurately depicting him.Mike Hodges directs with unparallelled flair and skill. The cinematic landscape is one of beautifully realised dirtiness grime and industrial pollution and decay  aptly mirroring the moral decay and dissolution of the characters that pass through it. The streets are cramped dingy terraces and grungy seventies workingclass chic is prevalent  pubs clubs ugly ageing cabaret artistes tobacco smoke and beer fumes. By contrast the local Mr Big superbly underplayed by playwright John Osborne lives in a secluded and ostentatious country mansion populated by dollybirds and middleaged pokerplaying sleazebags. His competitor Brumby resides on a mockTudor suburban estate. The class divide is thrown into sharp relief  crime pays and brings luxury working for a living obviously doesn't bringing instead misery and premature death.Carter is the ultimate outsider  he doesn't fit in anywhere. He collides with both cultures and methodically tears them asunder. This is the best British gangster film ever made. Not one wasted frame not one superfluous line of dialogue everything has a meaning and relevance. A master class of neorealistic cinematic poetry. If you haven't seen it then do so. If you have then watch it again. It's worth its weight in gold. Word of warning though  do not under any circumstances confuse this with the appalling and insulting Stallone remake. Get the original Get Carter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Caine has often said that GET CARTER was the first gangster movie not to portray gangsters as either being stupid or funny . Hes right  but he could also have added that this was probably the first film not to show gangsters as being sexy in anyway . Sure Glenda  Magaret etc might be physically attractive but sexy ? I dont think so . And the men arent any less unattractive  almost all of them are cowardly two faced weasels or violent thugs and often these character traits overlap.Director Mike Hodges has made a bleak   nihilistic classic film . He isnt flashy unlike present day film makers associated with gangster flicks but thats not a criticism . I love the way Hodges makes use of the locations in showing the North East of England as a cold  austere windswept urban area of high rise council estates and red brick terraced houses with outside toilets . There is a train of thought that by showing the audience all this it dates the film but its also true that it reminds us that living standards are also different today . No one takes a phone call in the pub because everyone has a mobile phone nowadays  the internet and videos have replaced slide shows and silent 8mm as the medium for porn  and its now illegal to dump the slag from coal mining into the sea because of EU regulations GET CARTER also has some really great dialogue which I could sit here all day quoting . But I wont bother except to say my favourite line is when Carter jumps out of bed naked and holds a gun on Con and PeterCon  Put it away jack you know you wont use it Peter  The gun hes talking about classic dialogue from a classic film".

And the men arent any less unattractive  almost all of them are cowardly two faced weasels or violent thugs and often these character traits overlap.Director Mike Hodges has made a bleak   nihilistic classic film . He isnt flashy unlike present day film makers associated with gangster flicks but thats not a criticism . I love the way Hodges makes use of the locations in showing the North East of England as a cold  austere windswept urban area of high rise council estates and red brick terraced houses with outside toilets . There is a train of thought that by showing the audience all this it dates the film but its also true that it reminds us that living standards are also different today . No one takes a phone call in the pub because everyone has a mobile phone nowadays  the internet and videos have replaced slide shows and silent 8mm as the medium for porn  and its now illegal to dump the slag from coal mining into the sea because of EU regulations GET CARTER also has some really great dialogue which I could sit here all day quoting . But I wont bother except to say my favourite line is when Carter jumps out of bed naked and holds a gun on Con and PeterCon  Put it away jack you know you wont use it Peter  The gun hes talking about classic dialogue from a classic film";

Nowadays it's like we're afraid to show nudity.  Land of the free with a first amendment and movies like Eyes Wide Shut get censored or they don't shoot the film.  I really hate that.  So here's a movie that's 30 yrs old that outshine's the 2000 version.  Kinda like a Dirty Harry movie it has much action in a movie made in it's time.  I'm amazed.Biggest change is and Michael Caine comments on the fact that americans don't like their hero's or villains killed So it's no surprise that Stallone has this hippy go lucky ending while Michael Caine's version has himself killed because we are made to hate him and he hate's himself. It's one of the best movies I've discovered.910These are just a few main factors that went into my rating. Quality 1010 Replayable 910 Entertaining 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this recently as it is a wellknown British classic thriller. As with a lot of these older films made in '71 the sound quality wasn't great. That slightly spoiled my enjoyment of the film.If I was to choose a soundtrack that complemented a film perfectly I would choose the Get Carter theme. The tune opens the film with a solo played on a harpsichord I think which evokes a sense of disaffection and then in the film we arrive by train at a industrial wasteland that is Newcastle in the 1970's. Also a bass guitar is playing a groovy riff in background and that is after we have witnessed in the film gangsters enjoying a porn film. The music sets up the film perfectly.It has been a while since I watched this film. It certainly reminded me of classic 70s TV programmes like The Sweeney and Play for Today. Gritty sleazy and with a aftertaste of poverty. Looking back at it though it's quite a straightforward revenge flick. There isn't much character development for Michael Caine as Carter but he is still good in a quiet reserved performance.One surprise for me was that the film starred the famous English playwright John Osborne as one of the northern gangsters Cyril. He is famous for writing plays such as Look Back in Anger. There is northern twist to this film with the backdrop of austerity in Newcastle played against the rich London gangster. Hands full of pound notes and drinking beer out of a straight glass. This brings an added interest to the film. I really thought the setting of the film is one of the most enjoyable parts of it and alongside the haunting music really captures your interest more than it would in another location.If you want to recapture life in Britain in the 1970's you will love this movie and it has some of the best British actors in it like Caine and Ian Hendry. The film starts fairly positively for Carter and then descends gradually into hell as he seeks more and more revenge. In the end there is no good guys left including Carter. I gave it a 610 because I felt it could have developed the character's back story a bit more but it is one of those films that stays in your head long after the film ends.".

That means that anyone who gets in his way and anyone of whom he can take advantage is subject to be tortured beaten killed et cetera. Such is the case with Jack Carter's suspicion that his brother's death was no drunk driving accident.If other more powerful gangsters are those who a gangster seeking personal vengeance must confront there will naturally be attempts to administer a taste of his own medicine to throw him off the trail to run him out of town to rub him out completely. This as it does in the case of such a brutal brand of justice simply makes matters worse. First of all if what can loosely be referred to as his colleagues want him out of town so bad it is a clear sign that his suspicions have been correct so not only is he going to retaliate his brutal plans are going to become even more brutal now. There is a revelation as to the reason for his brother's death that sends him in a figurative sense and someone else in a literal sense over the edge. Revenge ensues summarily though director Mike Hodges like Boorman before him and Soderbergh after appreciates the boundaries of fatalism the development toward the truth leading into the ocean soggy and gloomy.Violence breeds violence which breeds more violence in this enjoyable British gangster picture a seminal film for Michael Caine who sharpened his ability in his string of crime films in the 1960s particularly in this one to give such a charismatic and arresting performance as a character who has no intentionand neither do the filmmakersof making us like him. Get Carter is also a piece of efficient and effective stylistic economy. The spare stationary camerawork is firstrate capturing whole scenes in single unobtrusive let stylishly done takes and Jack Carter's vicious and merciless revenge plays out against the backdrop of smokefilled pubs private social clubs and derelict urban housing shot on location a very clever approach as it includes intriguing spots like an apparently wellknown raw concrete multistorey parking garage with a rooftop caf and a level in the process of being developed into a restaurant. This is the location for an utterly clean and graceful defenestration only the coolest gangland cucumber could execute so swiftly. There is also a gripping chase along a black industrial shoreline littered with piles of coal. Ultimately a great deal of its charm comes from incidental detail.That doesn't stop with the shrewd visuals. It's also in the distinctive jazz score which is a welcome convention of the era's crime pictures as well as the unapologetically downhome Cockney dialogue a sort of precursor to the pervasive quotability of Guy Ritchie's contemporary East End thug throwbacks. Like Ritchie's popular Brit grit Get Carter is what notoriously tough critic Pauline Kael referred to at the time of its release as calculated soullessness a description I can't put it any better as it is essentially a sadomasochistic testosterone dream full of business suits sawnoff pump action shotguns and payback time but it's all so clever and intelligently pulled off. Unlike Ritchie's whirlwindspeed genre exercises and what makes Hodges' much more laconic film a drag at times is the transparent attempt at idolizing Carter as a Hugh Hefnertype playboy who effortlessly gets a woman off via phone and nails even his temporary landlady despite the harm he causes her. All women in the film are purely sex objects not characters. However unlike Ritchie's films and what makes Get Carter more interesting overall is that it makes little to no attempt to be endearing lighthearted or funny its title character is coldblooded cruel and even unkind.In spite of its indulgences and what would become Hodges' signature lagging pace Get Carter is a taut potent procedural that doesn't bother with pious platitudes about the inability to live with a guilty conscience that one doesn't want to see oneself as a bad guy and instead gives us what is probably a much more realistic rendering of a gangster inhabiting a gangcontrolled world a guy who's content to see himself as a villain as he calls himself. There's a pervading mood in all storytelling media that's inclined to teach us the way to behave through showing us rightthinking people as our protagonists which never comes across as particularly believable in crime films even good ones. Here is a movie that isn't afraid to show a bad guy brutalizing other bad guys than which he's no better as well as some halfway decent people and the only reason he is the protagonist is because he's reacting instead of instigating.".

	schema:reviewBody "the question that continues to haunt me about this film is why does jack carter want to avenge his brother  that question may seem off the wall modern western audiences have long accepted as established fact that revenge is generally a good thing a kind of 'wild justice' as a philosopher once called it.outside of being utterly wrong and inevitably leading to unnecessary violence this attitude makes it difficult to raise the really difficult question concerning any one particular act of revenge namely what is the real motivation to it. for on reflection it is clear that not everyone attempting revenge does so for the same reason. the two brief moments in this film when carter meets his niece warn us that there is something very profoundly wrong going on here. he has no relationship with her at all and really doesn't want one. he is certainly outraged when he discovers that she was seduced into making a pornographic film but when he confronts the person who accidentally shows him the film he makes it clear that much of his outrage has to do with his family name  a very odd bit of pride for someone who has apparently spent of his adult life avoiding going home to visit the folks. and when he confronts one of the makers of the film he does remark that the 'doreens of this world'  that is the young women victimized in this fashioned  have no one to fight for them which suggests that he intends to do just that  which partly explains why he informs on the pornring to the police something very odd for a professional criminal to do. yet despite all this i remain unconvinced  for instance he has no qualms at all about murdering a prostitute who is clearly as much a victim of this pornring as his niece.but if i read the one scene aright where he reminds one of the pornring that his niece's name is 'carter  my name is carter' that carter is here most offended by the abuse of someone bearing the family name then carter's motivation becomes a little more clear he isn't avenging his brother at all he's avenging himself. which clearly makes him one of the most selfcentered 'revengers' in film history.what hodge  borrowing inspiration from the lee Marvin film point blank  and Caine have done is to lure us into a frame of mind such that we expect carter to at last prove himself heroic or perhaps tragic or in some other way tangibly human  only to reveal the painful truth that he is none of these. he is every bit as rotten to the core as those he attacks. but how does someone like this who has lived most his life in the shadows of the underworld develop such a pride in the family name that he is willing to give up everything for it  and why these questions can't be properly posed or answered here and actually i as yet have no answer. but clearly something some value that sustained jack carter's survival got lost back home when he wasn't paying attention to it. when he first sets out on his quest he seems to think he can fight to get it back by the end of the film it's clear he has no where left to go.an unsentimental character study of a pitiless criminal in a pitiless underworld. tough stuff.".

	onyx:emotionText "the question that continues to haunt me about this film is why does jack carter want to avenge his brother  that question may seem off the wall modern western audiences have long accepted as established fact that revenge is generally a good thing a kind of 'wild justice' as a philosopher once called it.outside of being utterly wrong and inevitably leading to unnecessary violence this attitude makes it difficult to raise the really difficult question concerning any one particular act of revenge namely what is the real motivation to it. for on reflection it is clear that not everyone attempting revenge does so for the same reason. the two brief moments in this film when carter meets his niece warn us that there is something very profoundly wrong going on here. he has no relationship with her at all and really doesn't want one. he is certainly outraged when he discovers that she was seduced into making a pornographic film but when he confronts the person who accidentally shows him the film he makes it clear that much of his outrage has to do with his family name  a very odd bit of pride for someone who has apparently spent of his adult life avoiding going home to visit the folks. and when he confronts one of the makers of the film he does remark that the 'doreens of this world'  that is the young women victimized in this fashioned  have no one to fight for them which suggests that he intends to do just that  which partly explains why he informs on the pornring to the police something very odd for a professional criminal to do. yet despite all this i remain unconvinced  for instance he has no qualms at all about murdering a prostitute who is clearly as much a victim of this pornring as his niece.but if i read the one scene aright where he reminds one of the pornring that his niece's name is 'carter  my name is carter' that carter is here most offended by the abuse of someone bearing the family name then carter's motivation becomes a little more clear he isn't avenging his brother at all he's avenging himself. which clearly makes him one of the most selfcentered 'revengers' in film history.what hodge  borrowing inspiration from the lee Marvin film point blank  and Caine have done is to lure us into a frame of mind such that we expect carter to at last prove himself heroic or perhaps tragic or in some other way tangibly human  only to reveal the painful truth that he is none of these. he is every bit as rotten to the core as those he attacks. but how does someone like this who has lived most his life in the shadows of the underworld develop such a pride in the family name that he is willing to give up everything for it  and why these questions can't be properly posed or answered here and actually i as yet have no answer. but clearly something some value that sustained jack carter's survival got lost back home when he wasn't paying attention to it. when he first sets out on his quest he seems to think he can fight to get it back by the end of the film it's clear he has no where left to go.an unsentimental character study of a pitiless criminal in a pitiless underworld. tough stuff.";

The latest DVD release features this film uncut with the option of an English or Italian track but those details might not be too important nor is the comedy because the main draw of this film is the body of Fenech. If you're wanting to see the beauty naked then you've come to the right picture because there's plenty of that. As far as the film itself goes it's really nothing too special. With the idea of a husband cheating on Fenech you have to use your imagination but this does lead to some nice funny moments with the husband running around town trying to catch up with her before she can sleep with someone else. Other funny sequences includes the one where Fenech decides to show her breasts to other men in front of the husband. Lionello does a pretty good job in the role of the husband even though he wildly overacts but this is something that seems to be the case in terms of all male performances from the films I've seen from this genre. As for Fenech she's as charming as ever and she looks as great as ever. She isn't shy when it comes to showing off her wonderful body and that happens throughout the majority of the running time. A lesser actress would have made this film pretty much worthless but fans of hers will certainly want to check this out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tyrone Power is a man who encounters a leprechaun in The Luck of the Irish also starring Anne Baxter Jayne Meadows Cecil Kellaway and Lee J. Cobb. Power plays Stephen Fitzgerald a newspaperman who takes a job with an influential publisher turned politician Augur Cobb  not because he believes in Augur but because of the money and prestige. Egging him on is Augur's elegant glamorous daughter Meadows who's in love with him. And who can blame her. It's outrageously handsome and charming Tyrone Power. While in Ireland Fitz meets a young woman Nora to whom he's attracted and a leprechaun with the proverbial pot o' gold. Even though Fitz gets the gold he returns it and the leprechaun is in his debt. When Fitz returns to New York the leprechaun appears as a servant Horace and strange things begin to happen.This is a charming film that effortlessly draws you into its whimsical story. Power did many comedies when he first signed with 20th Century Fox and if you've seen them you know he performed them beautifully. His reactions while a bartender is telling a leprechaun story are hilarious. It's a shame this versatile actor didn't put down his sword and do more comic roles. He'd pay homage once again to the land of his ancestors in The Long Gray Line for John Ford seven years later. How sad that when the really good parts were finally coming his way he died. Anne Baxter is darling as Nora and Meadows is appropriately brittle. The two are great opposites  Baxter natural and sweet Meadows made up and bejeweled. Kellaway is excellent as Horace the leprechaun turned houseman.The Luck of the Irish will leave you with a smile on your face. Uplifting stories are hard to find  see this one.".

Most actresses have difficulty doing an Irish accent believably but Anne Baxter pulls it off quite well and is not only beautiful but endearing as well. A good lesson can be learned from this film and there are several good quotations in it. The end is satisfying and leaves the viewer feeling happy and perhaps a little whimsical.

	schema:reviewBody "This film was shown recently on cable it was a refreshing change of pace. This 1948 movie directed by Henry Koster is a delightful experience for the young at heart and for those of us enchanted by the Irish folk lore.The movie's plot is just a pretext to present Tyrone Power one of the most handsome actors of the period in a light comedy that takes him to Ireland the land of his ancestors to discover himself. The story is a fantasy if not how could we believe in Stephen's transformation by what he witness at the waterfall by the river or his encounter with Nora at the inn? Not only that but no sooner than he is back in New York Horace the leprechaun makes an unexpected entrance in his life and suddenly he discovers Nora riding the IRT?This is a movie to be enjoyed because of the marvelous cast. Tyrone Power plays Fitz who is a different man from his experiences in Ireland. Fitz evidently having drunk the Irish whiskey and eaten the Irish stew is a changed man. Mr. Power plays this man effortlessly. Equally excellent is Cecil Kellaway. His Horace is a man that has all the magical powers to lure Fitz back to the old sod. Horace is a clever old man who can see right through anyone. Anne Baxter is also a great asset. Ms. Baxter and Mr. Power had a nice chemistry. Her Nora shows the right balance to attract Fitz and make him fall in love with her and with Ireland.Lee J. Cobb's Augur doesn't have much to do but he is good as the man who wants to please his daughter above all things. Jayne Meadows made a rare appearance in the movie as Frances the spoiled girl that wants Fitz for herself and will do everything in her power to get him.This movie was a rare find. Watch it and cherish it with an open heart.".

One wonders why Darryl Zanuck didn't bother to do the whole thing in color for his favorite star Tyrone Power.Other performances of note are Lee J. Cobb as the publishing magnate whose political views Power is diametrically opposed to but who accepts a position with him. Also Jayne Meadows who is Cobb's daughter and purportedly one of the perks that goes along with the job. She's got her eyes set on Power as a husband.Money and the comforts of life that can be bought with it are not easy things to turn down especially if one has a taste for them.

	schema:reviewBody "In a premise very similar to the recent musical Brigadoon two men Tyrone Power and James Todd I believe end up in the Irish countryside as opposed to the Scottish location of Brigadoon and encounter the beautiful Anne Baxter while Power continually has visions of leprechaun Cecil Kellaway. Baxter and Power of course fall in love but he must return to obligations in New York City. Hired by powerful politician Lee J. Cobb Power becomes involved with his daughter Jayne Meadows but must deal with the presence of his rather clumsy new valet played by none other than Mr. Kellaway. Is he or isn't he the leprechaun from Ireland? Kellaway won't say but in dropping hints it appears he is. Like the leprechaun he has a taste for whiskey and is very prankish as well. He steals the milk from all of Powers' neighbors so it won't spoil. After being pickpocketed in the crowded New York subway Power encounters a visiting Anne Baxter and they renew their friendship in spite of his engagement to Meadows. Powers now has choices to makewill he pursue his own happiness or follow what he believes to be his destiny? This enchanting comedy is an excellent followup for Cecil Kellaway's Academy Award Winning performance in The Miracle on 34th Street and had he not won the year before he would certainly have had a better chance although the winning Walter Huston was certainly deserving of the award. Had Kellaway's role been expanded just a bit more he would actually be the leading man!Power seems much more comfortable here than he did in the same year's That Wonderful Urge perhaps because his character is much more realistic and the script feels very modern. The subway scene in New York is quite refreshingly real. How many lighthearted films actually show a pickpocketing? It bogs down a bit with the political story and the romance between Power and Meadows seems doomed from the start. Anne Baxter fresh from her own Oscar for The Razor's Edge also opposite Power is perfectly sweet and feisty as the Irish lass. She makes me think of a young Maeve Helen Gallagher on Ryan's Hope. The wedding reception scene is straight out of Ryan's Bar and is only missing Gallagher hopping onto the bar to sing Danny Boy. The scenes in Ireland are filmed with a mystical feeling particularly the stream and waterfall where Power initially sees Kellaway.Thank You 20th Century Fox for opening up your archives to audiences to see these classics not frequently seen on TV. This is one of the best.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an amusing and charming Irish fairy tale. A reporter and columnist Steven Fitzgerald Tyrone Power gets lost on a visit to Ireland and finds himself at a country inn run by Nora Ann Baxter and her father. He bumps into a leprechaun Cecil Calloway forces him to offer up his pot of gold and thinking the little guy is some kind of fruitcake gives it back to him. Calloway promises eternal gratitude and gives him a Spanish doubloon as a good luck piece. Power and Baxter are attracted to one another but Power has other plans in New York and takes his leave.In New York he's been hired at a high salary to write speeches and essays in support of a politician Lee J. Cobb. Cobb's influential rich and powerful daughter Jayne Meadows goes with the job. But Power and Cobb have their disagreements. On top of that a man shows up claiming to have been sent by the agency to take care of Powers' modern new apartment. He bears a suspicious resemblance to the leprechaun and is played by the same actor. Baxter shows up in New York to attend a kinsman's wedding and meets Power by accident on a crowded subway. Powers' dissatisfaction with his new responsibilities grows until he finally leaves his fiance and his job marries Baxter and returns to Ireland to work.The first half hour and the last few minutes are set in the Irish village and they're as charming as a child's fairy tale. The much longer center section is a morality tale with serious overtones and I'm afraid it turns into a story of a man who discovers his life is empty and decides to change it radically. Power has done this trip before in The Razor's Edge. The peasants are pretty generic. So are the coldhearted cosmopolites back in New York. The former all have large families are fun loving cheerful a little careless about punctuality believe in legends know how to drink have dances and play lots of music and put away big meals and don't much worry about money. This is true of all generic peasants. It doesn't matter whether they're Irish or Jewish or Italian or Polish or Greek or anything else. Zorba the Mick.But that doesn't matter much. It's still fun. There are some people in Ireland who believe that Americans have a fairytale view of the Auld Sod but although H. L. Mencken argued that nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people I think we're all smart enough to know a fairy tale when we see one. Why are all such Irish fantasies set in a green countryside with stone walls rolling hills patches of woodland and softly flowing brooks? Partly because so much of the country actually looks like that and partly because the cities do not. Anyone for Belfast? Power is handsome. Baxter and Calloway all do respectable Irish accents. Rod Serling probably would have enjoyed adapting this for a Twilight Zone episode. Overall it's quite enjoyable.".

	schema:headline " Aside from some awful tinting a lovely and fun film";
	schema:reviewBody "The DVD for this film from 20th CenturyFox is interesting because it offers you the choice of seeing it in glorious black  white or in the bizarre manner that it was originally shownwith all the sequences in Ireland almost half the film tinted KoolAid green! Now tinting was common in the silent movie days but doing so in 1948 was odd. You may wonder why they didn't just film it in colorand there's a very good reason they couldn't do that. Just like when they filmed HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY set in Wales they couldn't make the film a color one because there is a lot of dirt and dry scrub in Southern California where they make filmsand the film was set in a very lush green land. The wrong locale would have been VERY obvious in color films and had they used color no one might have been convinced it was the old country Ireland. However the color tinting really wasn't very clever as it made the film buttugly. I watched the DVD that way but fortunately you can chooseand I strongly suggest you try any way other than tinted!! As for the film it's a lovely little fantasy film about Tyrone Power getting himself a Leprechaun helper in the form of Cecil Kellawaywho is adorable in the film but a bit too large to be one of the little people! Still with such a lovely acting job this can be forgiven. In some ways Power having this magical friend who only wants to help straighten out his life is very reminiscent of the later Burl Ives film THE BRASS BOTTLEthough Kellaway uses far less obvious magic and the film isn't nearly as crazy as THE BRASS BOTTLE. In fact though there is a bit of magic most of the help Kellaway gives is in the form of advice and a small helping hand. The problem is that Power doesn't think he needs help and is blindly walking into a life he'll soon regret. Heck everyone in the audience and all his friends in the film recognize this but fatheaded Tyrone is too singleminded to see it for himself.The film is clever and cute without being too obvious and too kooky. Overall it earns a 7 for quality though the fun factor is higherand if I were to score how much I enjoyed the film an 8 might be more appropriate. It's a lovely little romantic film that deserves a lookjust NOT in the yuck tinted versionsaints preserve us!".

He is too serious and has no trace of whimsy in his make up. Kellaway was nominated for an Academy Award for best Supporting Actor. He deserved to win in my opinion but lost out to Walter Huston for his role in Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Another problem I have with the movie is Henry Koster's undistinguished and rather flatfooted direction. I think it was a really clever idea of producer Fred Kohlmar to dress up the Irish scenes with a green tint. True he had to do something but reverting back to the heyday of silent movies when tinting was commonplace was a masterstroke.".

	schema:text "    The year is 1795 and young Jane Austen is a feisty 20yearold and emerging writer who already sees a world beyond class and commerce beyond pride and prejudice and dreams of doing what was then nearly unthinkable  marrying for love. Naturally her parents are searching for a wealthy wellappointed husband to assure their daughter's future social standing. They are eyeing Mr. Wisley nephew to the very formidable not to mention very rich local aristocrat Lady Gresham as a prospective match. But when Jane meets the roguish and decidedly nonaristocratic Tom Lefroy sparks soon fly along with the sharp repartee. His intellect and arrogance raise her ire  then knock her head over heels. Now the couple whose flirtation flies in the face of the sense and sensibility of the age is faced with a terrible dilemma. If they attempt to marry they will risk everything that matters  family friends and fortune.";

The writers have simply devised a beautiful and clever story from only a small shred of evidence that there was a true love in her life. From what I gather the movie was really meant to be an fictional intervention in her life devised from what was known of her. I thought Becoming Jane was funny beautifully shot and it made me giddy with lust over McEvoy. I loved the sexual energy and meeting of the minds between the love interests. I saw quite a few parallels between this story and Jane's novels. I really believe that Jane would absolutely adore this version if not find it amusing how it was crafted. I do agree that to create a story about a much loved female author is risky territory as there are devoted fans of Austen's who are looking for a representation that they personally feel fits their idea of what motivated her as a writer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seldom does one go to a movie with high expectations and ends up having them fulfilled but Becoming Jane is an exception in this case. I was charmed by Anne Hathaway's turn in Brokeback Mountain and The Devil Wears Prada and couldn't really understand the outcry resulting in her being cast as Jane Austen and after having watched the movie I know for sure Anne Hathaway was the right person for the role.Hot on the heels of 2005's Pride and Prejudice this movie offers a look into the early years of a spirited Jane Austen and her encounter with a man who could have formed the basis of one of her most famous literary characters Mr Darcy.I have to say this movie is without a doubt one of the BEST period films I have ever seen. Not only is it visually stunning but the performances from everyone are superb.Maggie Smith a delightful as the shrewd old Aunt.Julie Walters excellent as the mother who would give anything to knock some sense into her daughter  Jane Austen that is .Anna Maxwell Martin is also very good as the sister and confidante of Jane Austen.The director Julian Jarrold has done a wonderful job of making an amazing movie that will appeal to all generations.And finally the two very charming leads who are the very heart of the movie  Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy. In one word both are AWESOME. James although has little screen time then Anne makes you understand the sheer cockiness and arrogance of Tom Lefroy from his live free attitude in life to his transformation as a man who begins to care for Jane Austen.His chemistry with Anne Hathaway is sizzling and a very important factor in maintaining the movie's momentum.And at last to the leading lady Anne Hathaway. The lady is a marvel as Jane Austen her determination and spark is vividly captured by Anne in what can be called a very career defining performance. Not only does one feel the pain for Jane but one does marvel at what holds her together and her writing makes her pull through in life.It is Anne Hathaway's spirited portrayal of the literary icon that forms the essence of the movie.From her determination to write and her heart break to her feisty attitude to succeed as a writer is uniquely captures by the young actress. One can't really find the exact words to describe the actress's performance as Jane Austen  which is if simply put great.This movie has the makings to become the period drama of the year. A fine job by the actors and entire crew of the movie for giving us an insight to what could have been very important years in the young authors life.A delight to watch in every sense 810".

	schema:reviewBody "It is a truth universally acknowledged that reviews of Jane Austen movies must begin with the phrase 'It is a truth universally acknowledged...'.I know very little about Jane Austen's life although I spotted an error in this movie anyway her deafmute older brother George was NOT raised at home with her as seen here he was institutionalised and the handsigning which Anne Hathaway briefly uses here is partly anachronistic. I confess that I've very little interest in Miss Austen nor in her novels. But I'm hugely interested in the Regency period in which she lived. As I watched 'Becoming Jane' I was pleasantly astounded by the incredible period detail throughout the film the houses inside and out the books the churchyards the carriages and coaches the clothing. Even the musical instruments the music and the dances are authentic! Well done! Of course all these late 18thcentury people have 20thcentury orthodontia and their hair is too clean. And the cricket bats don't look or sound as if they were made of willow as they should have been.I know that some people will be watching this movie for the costumes so let me assure you that there are plenty of Empire waists coalscuttle bonnets top boots and Kate Greenaway frocks. Several of the ladies wear delightful gloves.This movie follows most of the rules for costumedrama chickflicks. We get the de rigueur scene in which fullyclothed young women surreptitiously watch naked young men. But not the reverse of course. We get the de rigueur scene in which a young woman performs a traditionally male activity and of course she beats the men at their own game. At a cricket match Jane Austen steps into the crease. The bowler gives her an easy one and of course she knocks it for six.I suspect that most of this movie is fiction and there is indeed one of those 'based on facts' disclaimers in the end credits. I was annoyed that various characters in this film constantly tell Jane Austen that as a woman she cannot hope to be the equal of a man nor can she expect a happy life without a husband. These may indeed have been the accepted realities of Austen's time but I had difficulty believing that so many people especially young men who hope to win her would make a point of making these comments so explicitly and so often.Also everyone in this movie keeps telling Jane that she cannot possibly write about anything which she hasn't experienced. So she can't write about sexual passion unless ... nudge nudge. However even in Austen's day this premise was demonstrably untrue. If I want to write a murder mystery do I need to commit a murder?The performances in this film are universally excellent. Any movie with Dame Maggie Smith in it I'm there. Ian Richardson in his last role is superb wringing the full value from some succulent dialogue. James Cromwell has matured into one of the finest character actors I've ever seen progressing lightyears beyond the infantile Norman Lear sitcom roles of his early career.As Jane Austen Anne Hathaway has the sense to attempt only a very slight English accent but she is far too pretty for this role. The real Jane Austen was apparently not pretty and this was a major reason for why she never married. It beggars belief that the Jane Austen seen here  the one who looks like Anne Hathaway  would have so much difficulty attracting suitors. However I'm a realist there's simply no way that any production company would spend this much money on a costume romance and then cast an unattractive actress in the lead role.Evidence indicates that Jane Austen's sister Cassandra was the prettier of the two and that this discrepancy strongly shaped their relationship. But again there's no way that the makers of this film would upstage their own star actress by casting someone more beautiful as her sister. Anna Maxwell Martin cast here as Cassandra is a splendid actress and fairly attractive but certainly no beauty in Hathaway's league.At the end of the film a title card alludes to Jane Austen's 'short life'. She actually lived to age 41 a longer lifespan than any of the Bront sisters' and fairly normal for Regency England. In the last scenes of this film we see Hathaway in some dodgy 'age' makeup which makes her look rather more sixtyish than fortyish. Near the end of her life the real Jane Austen had an unidentified illness which darkened her skin again I have no expectations of a bigbudget film doing anything to compromise the beauty of its leading actress.This film's title 'Becoming Jane' is a subtle pun since Hathaway's embodiment of Jane Austen is so very 'becoming'. Geddit?The makers of 'Becoming Jane' have gone to considerable trouble to give their target audience precisely what that audience want which is only marginally related to the facts. On that score they have succeeded. And the art direction in this movie is astonishingly thorough and good. I'll rate 'Becoming Jane' 8 out of 10 as an excellent FICTION film.".

	schema:headline " A questionable premise";
	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood can't seem to get enough of dead female English writers. Hot on the heels of Miss Potter and in advance of films about the Brontes we have this romantic confection about Jane Austen's youthful fling with Irish barrister Tom Lefroy.There have already been howls of criticism from outraged Janeites that the film is historically inaccurate. It's true that English teachers will have a fit at some elements of the story at best speculative and unsubstantiated at worst downright erroneous. The filmmakers admittedly didn't have a lot of historical material to work from. The true background to the story is contained in a couple of letters written by Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra and an admission by Tom Lefroy in old age that he had once been in 'boyish love' with the writer. On this slightly shaky platform the filmmakers have built a story of repressed passion and defiance of social mores that is a work of fiction worthy of a novel in its own right.This doesn't really matter. Nobody in their right mind would ever accept the version of events presented by a Hollywood biopic as historical gospel. The only viewers who will be taken in by the story seen here will be those who are too lazy too uninterested or too credulous to do the modicum of research needed to find out the real facts and who cares what such people think? This film may be largely untrue but what really matters is whether it works on its own terms qua film.Unfortunately it doesn't or at least not entirely. The main reason for this is the underlying premise. It is implied that without Jane and Tom's youthful affair Jane Austen would never have written her six great novels and in particular perhaps because it's the most familiar to audiences Pride and Prejudice. We see Jane angrily destroying a juvenile story criticized by Tom and later in the throes of love bashing out the first draft of P  P in a single night which shows an impressive turn of speed. It's plain that as Tom tells her 'experience is vital'.The same clunkingly literal idea  that an artist must experience emotions in order to write about them successfully  underscored Shakespeare in Love but there it was handled with a rather lighter touch. Here we are asked to believe that Pride and Prejudice was not a distillation of all Jane Austen's youthful experiences enlivened by a vivid imagination a sharp sense of humour and a dollop of literary genius but the next best thing to a true story. The reasons for this approach are obvious cinema can dramatize Johnny Cash learning the guitar or Picasso experimenting with paint but the spectacle of a writer sitting at a desk dreaming and scribbling palls pretty rapidly.The irony of a film that takes such wild liberties with the facts relying upon this trite old idea would certainly have been apparent to Jane Austen whose mastery of irony is emphasized rather unsubtly throughout. Moreover it's intellectually dishonest lacking the ability to create a Mr Darcy the filmmakers borrow freely from Jane Austen's characterisation in creating Tom and thereby cheekily suggest that the author was the one who lacked the imagination to make such a person up.These reservations aside does the film have anything going for it? Yes. The script has some witty moments and at least makes a decent stab at realistic 18th century dialogue. Ireland is a surprisingly effective and gorgeous substitute for Hampshire and the autumnal palette of washedout greens and greys is appropriately sombre. Anne Hathaway is an attractively skittish and impetuous Jane and she has excellent chemistry with James McAvoy whose performance as Tom by turns mercurial and obsessive is well up to his usual high standards.

	onyx:emotionText "Hollywood can't seem to get enough of dead female English writers. Hot on the heels of Miss Potter and in advance of films about the Brontes we have this romantic confection about Jane Austen's youthful fling with Irish barrister Tom Lefroy.There have already been howls of criticism from outraged Janeites that the film is historically inaccurate. It's true that English teachers will have a fit at some elements of the story at best speculative and unsubstantiated at worst downright erroneous. The filmmakers admittedly didn't have a lot of historical material to work from. The true background to the story is contained in a couple of letters written by Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra and an admission by Tom Lefroy in old age that he had once been in 'boyish love' with the writer. On this slightly shaky platform the filmmakers have built a story of repressed passion and defiance of social mores that is a work of fiction worthy of a novel in its own right.This doesn't really matter. Nobody in their right mind would ever accept the version of events presented by a Hollywood biopic as historical gospel. The only viewers who will be taken in by the story seen here will be those who are too lazy too uninterested or too credulous to do the modicum of research needed to find out the real facts and who cares what such people think? This film may be largely untrue but what really matters is whether it works on its own terms qua film.Unfortunately it doesn't or at least not entirely. The main reason for this is the underlying premise. It is implied that without Jane and Tom's youthful affair Jane Austen would never have written her six great novels and in particular perhaps because it's the most familiar to audiences Pride and Prejudice. We see Jane angrily destroying a juvenile story criticized by Tom and later in the throes of love bashing out the first draft of P  P in a single night which shows an impressive turn of speed. It's plain that as Tom tells her 'experience is vital'.The same clunkingly literal idea  that an artist must experience emotions in order to write about them successfully  underscored Shakespeare in Love but there it was handled with a rather lighter touch. Here we are asked to believe that Pride and Prejudice was not a distillation of all Jane Austen's youthful experiences enlivened by a vivid imagination a sharp sense of humour and a dollop of literary genius but the next best thing to a true story. The reasons for this approach are obvious cinema can dramatize Johnny Cash learning the guitar or Picasso experimenting with paint but the spectacle of a writer sitting at a desk dreaming and scribbling palls pretty rapidly.The irony of a film that takes such wild liberties with the facts relying upon this trite old idea would certainly have been apparent to Jane Austen whose mastery of irony is emphasized rather unsubtly throughout. Moreover it's intellectually dishonest lacking the ability to create a Mr Darcy the filmmakers borrow freely from Jane Austen's characterisation in creating Tom and thereby cheekily suggest that the author was the one who lacked the imagination to make such a person up.These reservations aside does the film have anything going for it? Yes. The script has some witty moments and at least makes a decent stab at realistic 18th century dialogue. Ireland is a surprisingly effective and gorgeous substitute for Hampshire and the autumnal palette of washedout greens and greys is appropriately sombre. Anne Hathaway is an attractively skittish and impetuous Jane and she has excellent chemistry with James McAvoy whose performance as Tom by turns mercurial and obsessive is well up to his usual high standards. Reliable support comes from James Cromwell Julie Walters the late great Ian Richardson and Maggie Smith who essentially reprises her character from Gosford Park. The problem is that the lovers' behaviour never really convinces us that this relationship was the foundation of Jane Austen's later literary success and ultimately peters out into a series of implausible endings the number of which gives Hot Fuzz and The Return of the King a run for their money.

Hathaway's accent is very good apart from a couple of very minor slips that could almost go unnoticed. The film the person I went with said was a little too slow in places but I did not find this so. I think that the director perhaps put a little too much emphasis on Austen's inspirations for her novels and in particular Pride and Prejudice but I did not mind this too much as that is my favourite novel. The acting all round was very good. MaCavoy played it nicely giving a lot of energy. I thought that the opening and closing were perhaps a little weak. I don't want to say too much in case others have not seen it yet though of course most know the ending they may not know the films interpretation of it. Perhaps the only few weaknesses to the film was the fact that perhaps Hathaway was too pretty to play Austen though she did a very competent job indeed. I think that Anna Maxwell Martin may perhaps have been more suited?! The other is that I would have liked to have seen slightly more quick wittedness on the part of Jane. She was shown as competent but not as cutting and quick as I and I imagine many believe she was. However despite this I quite enjoyed the film and wouldn't mind watching it again. It is better that Pride and Prejudice 2005 adaptation in my opinion. 810.".

This seemingly impossible feat is brought off by pretty much ignoring her many literary masterpieces and focusing instead with barefaced inaccuracy on a failed early romantic liaison. I'm not going to criticise the actors as they all too often get the blame for badly drawn characters but the notion that Anne Hathaway's Jane could have written a book like Pride and Prejudice is frankly hilarious. I can only assume that the makers of this film have mistaken all that swooning over Colin Firth's wet shirt scene and Greg Wise's heroics on horseback as evidence that fans of Jane Austen are nothing more than lovers of ditsy romances.Yes Austen's stories are essentially love stories but take the romance out and it's still great literature. It is her timeless wit intellect and brutal exposure of human nature that has made Austen one of the most widely read and appreciated authors in history. There is a very great and not at all delicious irony that the world Jane Austen describes is one in which a woman is judged merely on her ability to make a good match and that despite all her critical acclaim as a writer this is what film makers centuries later should choose to reduce her own life to. I watched this film against my better judgement on a flight between Quito and Miami. The immigration queues couldn't come quick enough.".

That it focuses on her life before she becomes a writer certainly had not dulled my appetite.The 22 yr old Austen is played by the very pretty Anne Hathaway who you'll know from Brokeback Mountain and The Devil Wears Prada. We meet her family when her older sister is happily married. The cashstrapped parents have the pressing problem of finding eligible young Jane a husband. A promising offer is the stuckup relative of wealthy Lady Gresham Maggie Smith who Jane rejects.Let's meet Tom Lefroy. He's a penniless charming intelligent apprentice lawyer. He also loves boxing drinking and the fairer sex. These latter hobbies mind you do not endear him to his uncle the imperious Judge Langlois who promptly sentences him to a summer in Hampshire as punishment. In a rustic backdrop of dancing and matchmaking Jane and Tom develop a teasing flirtatious rapport. Unlike the other men in her life Tom presents Jane with intellectual company as well as dashing good looks and a flair for the odd chatup. As they grow more serious about each other they become equally aware of how doomed their relationship is  something their elders twigged on page one. But Tom has given Jane something she needs  the knowledge of the heart that will impassion her writing.Firstly be warned. If you are expecting a nice feelgood movie don't bother. This made me thoroughly miserable. Not just because a poignant lonely destiny is too much to bear but because it's a wasted opportunity to bring a great life to the screen. Our ultimate theme Austen's writing yet we see little to convince that this bland and photogenic girl has much between the ears. In Devil Wears Prada an outstanding script enabled Hathaway to suggest hidden brainpower. In Becoming Jane the occasionally erudite lines sound leaden and false. Her body language meant to portray a rebel seems a bit anachronistic. Although she looks quite resplendent dashing across the hills in a billowing red dress to watch the lads skinnydipping the film is a sad disappointment in the development of Hathaway's otherwise promising career. Kate Winslet or Natalie Portman who were apparently also considered for the role might well have fared better they have a depth and experience that could perhaps have compensated for such a clunky script. Maggie Smith and other strong actors are reduced to ciphers and little more than icing on a badly made cake.On the other hand James McAvoy fresh from The Last King of Scotland is a revelation. In what seems like a flash of brilliance in the generally myopic casting he shines in every scene. A talented actor he also brings his skills in boxing and sport to imbue Lefroy with vibrancy and charisma. It is when he works his seductive charms on Jane that he also brings out the best in his costar. After her first adult kiss Jane trembles wondering if she has done it well. Hathaway does gooeyeyed emotion much better than persuading us she is a genius about to happen. The film gathers pace as we are drawn into an emotional cat and mouse. Jane's 'experience of the heart' that will inspire her is the one of the best things about the film second only to the large and constantly moist dollops of budgetsaving Irish countryside.But how does the film reflect on Jane Austen the author? Austen's possible flirtations with Mr Thomas Langlois Lefroy are more speculative than fact. Historian Jon Spence worked as a consultant on the film and has written a book of the same name which is probably a musthave for Austen fans. He gives attention to the inspiration he feels Lefroy gave to Jane and this is developed into actual events in the movie.Austen is one of the most influential and revered novelists of the early nineteenth century and her social commentary is marked with a strong sense of irony. Devotees will no doubt enjoy scenes such as the one where she corrects Tom's uncle on the definition of the word 'irony'. But the transition from girlishness to mastery with words is so contrived that it could almost be two parallel scripts.There are many that will love Becoming Jane in spite of its imperfections. The rest of us might wish it had been told better.".

Why must she have had a broken heart in order to write the way she did?All in all just go see BBC's 5 hr Pride and Prejudice. And then you will realize that this movie is so mediocre in comparison.";

	schema:headline " Destroying Jane";
	schema:reviewBody "Of all truths to be universally acknowledged I am admittedly and with all possible pride a nerd of the Jane Austen variety. Lovingly I have scanned the pages of each novel appreciating the irony and humor. Adamantly I have viewed every film adaptation that I am aware of from Lee's Sense and Sensibility to Chadha's Bride and Prejudice and little by little screenwriter's have slowly hacked away at her genius sometimes successfully. I have borne scenes of Hugh Grant play sword fighting of Keira Knightly stroking Matthew Macfadyen's calf and of Colin Firth half nude admirably well perhaps the latter more well than others but occasionally a writer crosses that very fine line between revering the most beloved authoress and destroying all that which she created.I do not pretend to be an Austen purist by any means I understand that adaptations of her novels can't all be five hours long and follow her dialogue word for word. We the Austen lovers of the world must surrender that movies are not books and cannot therefore be identical to them. Emma Thompson for example made countless changes in writing her version of Sense and Sensibility yet the alterations which she made were necessary. To me it would be just as much a disservice to Jane Austen to follow one of her novels word for word in the screenplay and produce a dull piece of cinema than it would be to add a sex scene to Persuasion. What is important in my opinion is that the finished film retain the spirit of the novel the humor the vivacity all that which makes her works as timeless as they are. This noted I must express my disappointment perhaps even disgust in Becoming Jane or as I have notsoaffectionately nicknamed it Kidnapping Raping and Murdering Jane which is neither accurate nor entertaining.With Shakespeare in Love and Finding Neverland as models of success Hollywood has pumped out disappointing flicks like Miss Potter and now Becoming Jane expecting viewers to lap it up but what the first two are that the latter two are not is clever. They intermingle inspiration with biography presenting the plot of the writer's lives almost as an ode to their work. Becoming Jane occasionally alluded to Pride and Prejudice the most famous of Austen's six completed novels but when it did so the allusions were weak and clearly forced. It was as though the screenwriters Kevin Hood and Sarah Williams were only familiar with Pride and Prejudice ignoring her other five masterpieces. What is must frustrating about this is that it would have been so simple to allude to the other works. Have Cassandra Jane's older sister encourage Jane to be more sensible with regards to her romance and voil! Sense and Sensibility! Throw in a young character that introduces Jane to bachelors in hopes of making a match and you've got Emma! But no all that Kevin Hood and Sarah Williams could think to do was make Tom Lefroy Jane's love interest seemingly arrogant but ultimately lovable.Similarly the film spends so much time expressing the tragedy of Jane Austen's situation that one forgets that Anne Hathaway is meant to be the clever witty woman that has hypnotized so many modern readers. I do not mean to scorn the movie's somewhat unhappy ending so unlike those in Austen novels but the way in which it ignores her character. Finding Neverland for example expresses the sadness of J. M. Barry's life yet at the same time presents the story in such a way that the viewer feels as though they are watching something as magical as Peter Pan. Though Becoming Jane is certainly inaccurate even inaccuracies would be tolerable if they were done in the name of preserving the spirit of Jane Austen's works. Instead we the viewer are presented with a poor composition of infrequent wit and mildly appealing romance hardly reminiscent of any of Austen's books.Apart from the abominable screenplay the direction was mediocre and predictable at best. Julian Jarrold does produce a pretty shot here and there but seems to have just discovered how to shoot an aerial view and so puts them in practically every other scene.In spite of this negativity I must admit that some of the acting was unexpectedly good. Anne Hathaway as Jane has a fine British accent and acts much better than I would have predicted this is after all the first movie I've ever seen her in that she doesn't start out a homely geek and end up a fashionforward bombshell. It is James McAvoy as Tom Lefroy however that puts in the show stealing performance. Maggie Smith is as usual good as are Julie Walters and James Cromwell even if those blasphemists Hood and Williams chose to throw in a scene of a well questionable nature between them.Even with decent acting and direction it is hard to produce a good movie based on a monstrous screenplay. The effect all in all is extremely disappointing. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who truly appreciates Jane Austen or good cinema.".

A Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.The Jane is Jane Austen and this is a fictional depiction of her young adult life before her novel writing career. I suppose half of the tale is based on fact such as she rejected a marriage proposal and half the tale is made up to create engaging storytelling. But that's not important.The essence of the story is the mores of proper English society around 1800. Woman had their place. And that place was to give oneself to an arranged marriage and become a dutiful wife and mother. It was even more important to be in these roles if you were a daughter of a minister of modest means who had lots of children to care for. Jane was one of those children.But Jane has spunk and smarts and a stubbornness to live her own life as she sees fit. Anne Hathaway plays young Jane convincingly and Anne's good looks are played down as much as possible. It's Jane's inner self that makes her attractive and not her exterior appearance.And she is so attractive that she has three suitors the rich and dull one the poor and roguish one and a secret and nefarious one. This circumstance allows us to see England from the various social strata which is fun and informative.Jane 200 years ahead of her time shows beauty and grace and charm and spirit and will not buckle to her day's lot in life. We should all have such courage  to follow our bliss knowing we have but one life to live.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.".

Hathaway is not only not believable as Jane Austen she is not believable as a writer. She just does not convey the cerebral verballyobsessed nature of a writer.Her body language is all wrong. Watching Hathaway pose slump and gesture like a twentyfirst century American girl reminds the viewer how well notable stars of previous welldone Austen adaptations like Amanda Root Jennifer Ehle and Emma Thompson used their bodies in conveying the corporeal realities of nineteenth century feminine life.James McAvoy is a very charismatic new star and I try to see every movie featuring him that I can but he just never works here at least partly because the movie is based roughly on Austen's real life so his character is written to ultimately disappoint both the audience and Jane but also because he and Hathaway have no chemistry.The movie's greatest flub is Mr. Wisley. As discussion boards show viewers liked Mr. Wisley and for good reason. The movie is supposed to want us to applaud how it deals with Mr. Wisley and we don't.Given that the movie is based on a real person's autobiography it paints itself into corner and the resolution we would like to see we can't. Jane treats Mr. Wisley poorly and gives no sign that she appreciates his depths because he is superficially lacking in charm and grace. Would the real Jane Austen have been so blind? It's hard to respect the Jane Austen in this film who can't see Mr. Wisley's true value but who chases after a man who can never make her happy.Anna Maxwell Martin who was so good in North and South is very fine as Cassandra Jane's older sister. James Cromwell as Jane's father is as excellent as he always is. Julie Walters is both lovable and believable as Jane's mother.".

Even without a historical basis as to the romance it isn't hard to realize what a character Jane was by her writing.Another defense I saw in a review was the lack of a sex scene. I've seen numerous period pieces that do not have sex scenes and that has nothing to do with the movie not being sexy enough. The build up in other period pieces such as Persuasion or Pride and Prejudice... the restraint... these are common for the times and still lend a great sense of sexual tension... which is partially relieved when they finally kiss or confess their love. Sex isn't needed to get this point across. This movie lacked it all  there was no sexual tension no chemistry... it was a big yawn in all ways.It is bleak boring and depressing. They make out that the man she was interested in was much more than she ever was yet that isn't saying much as I found him anything but lovable. He is arrogant a womanizer etc... and she is bland and boring.The other inaccuracies in this movie are astounding. E.g. Her reaching for a kiss first and then asking if it were good enough? Please! This would never happen. Or showing her playing a man's sport with her pantaloons showing as she runs about. Her treating the man courting her so badly. There are many more  far too many to list.Save yourself the time and trouble and watch a movie worth watching such as one of Jane Austen's.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have never thought I would EVER give anything with the name Jane Austen in it a single star but I'm so sorry this thing sucked. I couldn't figure out if it was more of a copy of Shakespeare in Love or Pride  Prejudice It seams like Miramax saw how good Working Title did with the 2005 PP and they wanted to take advantage of the Jane Austen fans. What happened Miramax? You did a wonderful Emma and Mansfield Park but you really jumped the shark. 1. It is so dirty! The reason why I love Jane Austen is that she can deal with real situations in real life without having the necessity of putting sex in it to make it sell. I felt like I was reading a typical boring fan fiction or a cheap Walmart Romance with the protagonist half naked on the cover. 2. I saw no originality. All was either a copy of PP SS Emma etc. It seamed like the director watched those movies and said Ok lets make a cheap and bad copy of that! I don't know why people keep on insisting that people's novels are based on their life's. I mean if 200 years from now someone make a movie called Becoming J.K. they are all going to base it on the Harry Potter books because J.K. Rowling wrote them. They are going to base her off Hermione Harry and Ron?! Doesn't make sense now does it. NEITHER DOES THIS3. Casting. Anne Hathaway! We can say Jane Austen goes to a ball...in PRADA.Jane Austen meets Tom Lefroy...in PRADA. Jane Austen writes her novels...Yes you guessed itin PRADA. I have nothing against Anne being American since I live in the US but honestly her accent sucked. At least Gwyneth Paltrow's was believable. They should have picked someone else. For a person living in the US not to believe her accent really is saying something you know. James McAvoy. I'm such a big fan of Atonement but what was he thinking?! He had the possibility of doing Mr. Darcy in the 2005 PP and he let it go! For what?! To do Tom Lefroy!! I hated his hair. I felt like I was watching Drake  Josh on Nick or something because his hair was Drake's but in the curly version. 5. Storyline. It was dumb and boring. I felt like I was watching some sort of dumb teenage show. With all those innocent references and everything. So yeah people piece of crap. Rewatch your old favorite Jane Austen adaptations since they are much better worth your time than this. I'm so sorry Jane I love you but I'm going to have to give you one star. I hope you wouldn't roll in your grave.".

Having said that I feel this movie was awful and misleading to someone who may not be familiar with her works and it would mislead someone to believe her to be a woman of distaste. This is obviously not the case and I feel she has been misrepresented. Why do film makers feel that including such filth and lust is necessary. Recent movies such as Sense and Sensibility Emma and Pride and Prejudice didn't indulge in such things and they were well received. Particularly those who are true to her stories. This was of poor taste and not recommended. I am surprised to see it was only rated PG. Everything was about sex and not the kind of love and intimacy she so very well understood and expressed in her literature. It is definitely not something I would want my daughter to see or a movie I would recommend.

	schema:headline " The Biographical Fallacy";
	schema:reviewBody "It is one of the ironies of literary history that although Jane Austen was possibly the greatest writer of romantic novels in the English language we should know so little about her own romantic life. A few years ago one academic earned the obloquy of Janeites everywhere by suggesting that their heroine might have had lesbian tendencies. There is very little evidence to support this hypothesis but in fairness to the said academic it should be pointed out that there is not much more evidence to prove definitively the hypothesis that Jane was heterosexual. We know that in her early twenties she had a brief friendship with a young Irish lawyer named Tom Lefroy but we do not know how deep that friendship went. We know that she received and refused a proposal from a young man named Harris BiggWither but we do not know her motives for rejecting him. This would have been a financially advantageous match so they were presumably not mercenary ones. We know that she was still unmarried when she died in her early forties. And that's about it.Becoming Jane is essentially a filmed biography of Jane Austen told in the style of a filmed Jane Austen novel. It explores the possibility that she and Lefroy might have been deeply in love and suggests that this romance might have been the basis for her novel Pride and Prejudice. Jane like her heroine Elizabeth Bennett is an attractive highspirited girl of 21. Like Elizabeth Jane has an older sister to whom she is devoted. Her parents are portrayed as very much the inspiration for Mr and Mrs Bennett in the novel in financial difficulties and forever worrying about how to marry off their daughters. There is an elderly imperious widow clearly the original of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and a creepy clergyman the prototype of Mr Collins obsessively in love with Jane. There is a clandestine elopement serving as the basis for Lydia's adventure with Mr Wickham.This is however an Austen novel with a difference in that it ends unhappily for the lovers. Unlike Mr Darcy Tom Lefroy is not the rich owner of a stately home but an impoverished struggling barrister. The romance between Jane and Tom has the support of neither her parents who would prefer her to marry a wealthier suitor Mr Wisley nor his autocratic uncle the ultrareactionary Judge Langlois on whom his prospects depend. Wisley is an invented character but he is obviously based upon BiggWither who in reality did not come into Jane's life until several years after the events shown in this film.The film critic of the Sunday Times criticised this film for being insufficiently erotic suggesting referring not only to this film but also Miss Potter and Mrs Brown that the British like to imagine their national heroines in love but not in bed. There is however a perfectly good reason why this film did not show any love scenes between Jane and Tom quite apart from the need to keep the family audience. Young women of good family in the late eighteenth century even when deeply in love did not jump into bed with their boyfriends as readily as they do in the twentyfirst. Contraception was much less reliable than it is today and any woman who lost her reputation for chastity would have been regarded as bringing shame not only on herself but also on her whole family.Another criticism I have seen both on this board and elsewhere is that Anne Hathaway is too attractive to play Jane. In fact we do not really know what Austen looked like during this period although her contemporaries paid tribute to her pleasing appearance. There is something of a tradition of casting glamorous actresses as literary figures and Hathaway playing Jane Austen is a much less obvious case of miscasting than Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf or Kate Winslet as Iris Murdoch. Coming next Catherine Zeta Jones as George Eliot? Angelina Jolie as Emily Dickinson? Hathaway in fact played her part very well. As in Nicholas Nickelby her British accent was nearperfect and James McAvoy something of a rising star of the British cinema after The Last King of Scotland made an appealing hero as Lefroy a man who hides his better nature under the guise of a roguish libertine. There were also some good cameo performances in the minor roles especially from the late Ian Richardson in his last role as the formidable Langlois. Another notable feature was the look of the film. Like most period dramas it was attractively photographed with County Wicklow in Ireland substituting for Austen's native Hampshire.There has in recent years been a glut of films about British female authors but apart from Miss Potter a touching romance about somebody who played a very minor role in the history of English letters the only one I really enjoyed was Sylvia which I felt gave us a real insight into Sylvia Plath's life. Iris was well acted but there seemed little connection between either Judi Dench's senile old lady or Kate Winslet's student sexpot and the reallife novelist Iris Murdoch. Similarly The Hours was not very enlightening about either Virginia Woolf's life or her work. Becoming Jane falls into the same category. It relies too heavily on the biographical fallacy the idea that works of fiction must be in effect disguised memoirs of the author's own personal experiences an idea which downplays the role of creativity and imagination in literature. As a romantic drama with a period setting it is perfectly acceptable but it does not do much to enhance our understanding of Jane Austen. 610".

Another example and a particularly execrable one of people making a movie that seems to deliberately remove everything that made the book worthwhile. This isn't' about failing to adhere to the details of Austen's life. Who cares about that? It's about using Ausen like a brand name like charging people to see a colorbynumber Mona Lisa.

	schema:headline " Austen's Powers Made Clear";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me say this first Yes. This movie is in fact NOT BASED OFF REAL LIFE. This appears to be the highest complaint for this clearly delightful and moving film about the fictitious life of Jane Austen. I walked into the theatre to see this movie knowing fully well that it was based off minor speculation and anybody who has any knowledge of Jane Austen knows that this movie is not real.It is a movie beautifully portrayed in the likes of Shakespeare in Love where Shakespeare was transformed into a poetic hottie rather than the ugly man with wooden teeth that he was most likely to have been. Shakespeare in Love garnered an Academy Award for best Picture whereas Becoming Jane has been criticized for its lack of reality. Personally I don't see what the fuss is about.Becoming Jane is a beautifully directed film when fantastic scenery and sets. Anne Hathaway and James MacAvoy both have haunting and entertaining performances making their slow journey to love extremely wonderful to watch. Maggie Smith is wonderful as well in her small role as a woman who I can only assume was the inspiration behind Pride and Prejudice's Lady Catherine.While the story does falter near the end giving the audience too many climactic moments before the film actually finishes I found it to be achingly romantic. MacAvoy and Hathaway had great chemistry and were thoroughly convincing as a couple deeply in love an emotion that caused them as much distress as it caused happiness.The movie exudes subtle sexuality displayed in a scene in which MacAvoy reads to Hathaway a passage from a nature book about mating birds and the female's screams of ecstasy another scene shows the lovers walking up stairs to ask for permission to marry MacAvoy gently grazes Hathaway's hand with his own and fondles the skirts of her dress. It was these subtle signs of love and lust that made this movie a treat to watch being as overt sexuality would not have mirrored the time period. A scene at the end of the film in which many years later the couple meet each other by chance and we see MacAvoy's daughter a charming lover of Jane Austen novels conveniently named Jane. His daughter named Jane is based on fact. The movie is a chilling look on the few options that women had at the time and shows that although true love can be found it can't always be kept.I recommend this film to anyone who is a lover of Austen a lover of romantic films or just anyone who is interesting in seeing a thoroughly entertaining and beautifully sad film about a love unexplored.".

I walked into the theatre to see this movie knowing fully well that it was based off minor speculation and anybody who has any knowledge of Jane Austen knows that this movie is not real.It is a movie beautifully portrayed in the likes of Shakespeare in Love where Shakespeare was transformed into a poetic hottie rather than the ugly man with wooden teeth that he was most likely to have been. Shakespeare in Love garnered an Academy Award for best Picture whereas Becoming Jane has been criticized for its lack of reality. Personally I don't see what the fuss is about.Becoming Jane is a beautifully directed film when fantastic scenery and sets. Anne Hathaway and James MacAvoy both have haunting and entertaining performances making their slow journey to love extremely wonderful to watch. Maggie Smith is wonderful as well in her small role as a woman who I can only assume was the inspiration behind Pride and Prejudice's Lady Catherine.While the story does falter near the end giving the audience too many climactic moments before the film actually finishes I found it to be achingly romantic. MacAvoy and Hathaway had great chemistry and were thoroughly convincing as a couple deeply in love an emotion that caused them as much distress as it caused happiness.The movie exudes subtle sexuality displayed in a scene in which MacAvoy reads to Hathaway a passage from a nature book about mating birds and the female's screams of ecstasy another scene shows the lovers walking up stairs to ask for permission to marry MacAvoy gently grazes Hathaway's hand with his own and fondles the skirts of her dress. It was these subtle signs of love and lust that made this movie a treat to watch being as overt sexuality would not have mirrored the time period. A scene at the end of the film in which many years later the couple meet each other by chance and we see MacAvoy's daughter a charming lover of Jane Austen novels conveniently named Jane. His daughter named Jane is based on fact. The movie is a chilling look on the few options that women had at the time and shows that although true love can be found it can't always be kept.I recommend this film to anyone who is a lover of Austen a lover of romantic films or just anyone who is interesting in seeing a thoroughly entertaining and beautifully sad film about a love unexplored.";

The two subjects and their families are simple and somewhat naive in an endearing way. Their struggles sometimes unflattering are put forth for us to relate to and we all can. Of course this is about two kids and their love for basketball and about the road to that takes place as they try to get there but it's really about the way people in nearpoverty live the education system and its downfalls the manipulation of organized sports and tendency for people to try and achieve their goals through others Arthur's father William's brother and the situation between blacks and whites in America. In one scene Arthur laments being around mainly white kids for the first time in his life and says it'll be difficult but he'll manage. That kind of relaxed confidence is so rewarding to watch. The film has endless insights into the black urban experience. Of course not every family in the ghetto is in a position where a father is a criminal and drug user but when two kids in the same story are in that situation it's got to be somewhat prevalent.It's the kind of movie that's sustaining and there are so many transcendent revealing moments that stand out Arthur's mother such an inspirational woman to watch as she gets her nurse certification Arthur's family talking to another family in a cafeteria with his mother highfiving an elderly white lady the descent into and path out of drug addiction and a scene where the man who recruits these boys says that sometimes he has doubts about himself when he sees the pain that's a part of these kids' lives. Spike Lee makes a brief appearance giving a speech to the kids and his pessimism is the only sore spot in the film.We don't have to work for any of this we don't have to question it. There's nothing to clean away before we can get to the real thing. This is the real thing. A curious moment however is one scene where Arthur's mother explains to us at one point she had her electricity cut off which suggests that the crew wasn't there to film that period. But the next scene has her walking in the dark with a lamp that seems like an undeclared reenactment of something they missed for editing purposes. But the criticism of manipulation in documentaries is tired. Yes the possibility of tricking an audience into believing something with a documentary is greater but unless it's political in some respect it doesn't matter. Documentaries are supposed to be presented how the filmmaker sees fit. With no license we'd have 350hour documentaries.At one moment near the end William's coach says goodbye to him and as he walks out his coach mentions that that's the system one goes out another comes in. It feels like we're saying bye to a member of the family. This is a lifeaffirming experience a family that should be visited again. 1010".

Both athletes of course dream of becoming pro players some day. There are hundreds of similar tales each season  of great players mostly black  who don't make it through college or even to college despite their enormous talents and one can get idea of some of the obstacles by watching these two guys.Gates is recruited by St. Joe's a powerhouse Catholic School which claims Isaiah Thmas as it most famous cage alumnus. There Gates plays for a typically gungho coach and has a lot of ups and downs both on and off the court. However he's a lot more mature than the other subject of the documentary Agee.Agee also is recruited by the private school but can't pay the tuition and is kicked out in his sophomore year. He then returns to his neighborhood public school and eventually becomes a star.Gates graduates and goes on to Marquette while Agee attends a junior college. From that point a summary at the end of the film brings you uptodate on what happened to the kids.Thus almost all of the three hours is devoted to these kids form junior high through high school. The families and friends of these athletes are interesting and the film really documents the different lifestyles between blacks and whites in the USA.It's a fascinating picture for people of any race. For nonblacks it shows them a window into a whole different world. This film is obviously not just to highlight basketball players but to show life as it exists with a lot of poor black families the good and the bad the achievements and the big mistakes. I enjoyed it just as much the second time as the first. It's one of the better documentaries I've ever seen so don't let the length of it discourage you.".

I know it sounds crazy to say that about a documentary but to me this film has more drama truth realism  emotion than a thousand Hollywood movies put together. I've seen it over 30 times and it never ceases to gladden my heart to see Arthur  William's story. The scene where Arthur's mom receives her diploma from nursing school has to be one of my all time favorites. For me this is one of the rare threehour movies that I never wanted to end. 1010.";

That is why I like some of the film's exhilarating oncourt action that is interspersed evenly with the human drama.Directed by Steve James and produced by Frederick Marx and Peter Gilbert Hoop Dreams originally began as a 30minute documentary about rising ballplayers but the filmmakers quickly saw that 30 minutes was just too narrow a scope for their story. This realization came when they witnessed two teens William Gates and Arthur Agee as they both try to join the NBA much like their idol Isiah Thomas.In total 250 hours of footage was gathered over the course of a fiveyear period and then edited into an engaging 171minute documentary following the two teens from ages 1418 as they attend expensive Catholic schools go through the rigorous oncourt training meet the demands of their coaches and live out their dreams. Director Spike Lee also appears at a training camp and gives some of the aspiring players some lessthaninspiring advice about what their skills mean to the people at the top of the ladder.We watch as their poignant reallife struggles unfold on the screen and watch as time after time they get stonewalled by the system of bureaucracy and racism that's meant to be especially hard on two young black boys from the ghetto. They have difficulty with making decent grades financial issues preparing for the ACT sportsrelated injuries and must contend with problems at home as well including trouble with family matters Arthur's relationship with his father is especially touching and sad William welcomes a new addition to his family while still in high school.For years success stories such as Hoop Dreams have dominated Hollywood cinema and have won over legions of audiences but we've never seen anything like this. Gates and Agee are both brighteyed and ambitious that they're embarking on something that's historically significant to their lives and community.This is the best movie about basketball and reality I've seen yet because of the simple fact that it's real no scripts no phony Hollywood theatrics just real action drama and emotions.1010".

	schema:headline " Engrossing documentary lacks scope";
	schema:reviewBody "Hoop Dreams is about two promising basketball players and their experiences playing in high school. At the beginning the two boys get a scholarship to a private school known for having an exceptional basketball program. Even though it requires each of them to take a ninety minute bus ride one way every day the school presents a huge opportunity for both of the boys it's much better in practically every way than the lousy underprivileged schools they previously attended.The film is very restrained in making its point which is something I found odd for a documentary film I don't watch many films like this but I thought the idea was for the filmmakers to make a clear argument rather than present a load of facts and allow the viewer to draw his own conclusions. In any case it's pretty clear to me that the film is critical of the process that leads these students to be recruited to play basketball at the tender age of 14. It turns out that the scholarship the boys get doesn't cover all expenses and so it proves to be impossible for Arthur Agee the boy who initially shows less promise to remain at the school for more than a year. This wreaks havoc on the already pathetic boy who has to deal with his family's extreme poverty due to his father's drug addiction and his mother's health related inability to keep a job. William Gates the more promising boy can't afford to pay the fee either but the school finds a sponsor to help him because of his more advanced skills.Arthur is really the more interesting character here as he is plagued with problems from the getgo and he has to try harder to get anywhere. In addition to his poverty he has to deal with his father's attempts to live vicariously through his success. He struggles to find his own identity. For a good portion of the film Arthur tries to copy the success of an NBA star from his area going so far as to borrow the older man's nickname for his own use.It struck me that both of these boys weren't paying enough attention to academics or social skills as they both seemed rather immature and ignorant particularly in terms of their future potential outside of basketball. Their academic failure is also made clear by their struggle to make an 18 on the ACT a score that is well below the national average.Hoop Dreams does a good job of telling the story of a little more than four years of the lives of two boys it's an engrossing enough film to make its three hour run time go by fairly quickly. The film also tells something about the environment promising athletes are thrust into from an early age and how they're sometimes manipulated into spending huge amounts of time doing something that really won't do them much good in life all in the name of making the dream of NBA stardom a reality. I would have liked the film more if it had a bit more context and scope as it is this work doesn't add up to much more than the story of two individuals when it probably should have said more about the entire system they're immersed in. I also feel that the filmmakers should have taken a stand and made some attempt to analyze the story they told their refusal to do so looks like a combination of laziness and cowardice to me. Still Hoop Dreams does enough right to make it a worthwhile viewing experience.".

Once business takes over all bets are off and lives are ruined. The promise of the American dream of wealth and success is nothing but a baldfaced lie. These topics were briefly touched on but for the most part the movie was a rather passive documentary that simply chronicled two different boys' lives in high school basketball for four years. That in itself was interesting enough for me to give this movie a good rating. The people are compelling and it was good to know that eventually at least one of the boys came to realize that his NBA dreams were unrealistic. The movie still presents a powerful portrayal of the lowerclass inner city blacks in America and the desperation they have to endure. One of the only outs for their kids seems to be sports scholarships. Enter the overzealous coach competitive scouts and legions of fans. It's interesting to see because no one in Canada is as obsessed with high school sports. I think it's mainly because it's the only way out for poor innercity blacks in America. The concept makes for an entertaining emotional documentary.".

This documentary spoke to more than just the overlying story of the two young men who followed their overriding dream by doing what they deemed necessary with the film itself chronicling their truelife tribulations along the way.  It also spoke to the thousands of young urban innercity youth who try to follow a path laid out for them via desegregation court orders bussing from inner cities to farflung suburbs all in the hope to receive better educations via superior academic and athletic facilities.  One of the most poignant scenes showed Arthur and William both alighting from the bus that has carried them from CabriniGreen to a seeming Heaven the Catholic high school in the suburbs where they matriculated and trudging through the snow up to the entrance to the school after a bus ride of more than an hour starting at 6AM.  The effort shown in this one act speaks volumes for the dedication these very young adolescents had toward attaining their goals as well as the hopes their parents had for their future wellbeing.  The truelife events detailed throughout the rest of the documentary enhanced and heightened the emotional triumphs and failures as seen through the eyes of these two youths and those closest to them.At the same time one could also see the ruthless nonforgiving side of competition and how it could be used to manipulate those participating in it.This was and is truly one of the most outstanding documentaries of all time. I would urge anyone anyone at all regardless of their background relating to sports to sit back and watch this documentary and to try to see it feel it through the eyes of the protagonists.  It is unforgettable.".

I now have a greater sense for how important athletics can be in ones life and the things that athletes will do to fulfill their dreams!! I bought this film on VHS when it first came out and i was definitely not disappointed. I would also like to mention that i had the privilege to meet Mr. William Gates at a 3 on 3 basketball tournament recently in which he was the guest speaker I would have to say that i was so amazed to see how compassionate he was and the man that he turned out to be. It was a great experience for me to be apart of. I would like to say to all those who have seen this remarkable documentary be on the lookout for Hoops Dreams 2 which will be released in the near future!!!".

I now have a greater sense for how important athletics can be in ones life and the things that athletes will do to fulfill their dreams!! I bought this film on VHS when it first came out and i was definitely not disappointed. I would also like to mention that i had the privilege to meet Mr. William Gates at a 3 on 3 basketball tournament recently in which he was the guest speaker I would have to say that i was so amazed to see how compassionate he was and the man that he turned out to be. It was a great experience for me to be apart of. I would like to say to all those who have seen this remarkable documentary be on the lookout for Hoops Dreams 2 which will be released in the near future!!!";

I know that there was a little mugging at times and little signs of embarrassment that gave one the sense that the camera was there but for the nearly three hours there must have been so much more footage these young people led their lives for us to see. This is the story of two young men who have grown up in the projects on the South Side of Chicago. Each is quite a basketball star and they have the dream of someday playing in the NBA. Their families are poor and in some cases unstable. The kids are stars in their own high schools but do have some issues with attitude and commitment. Having come off the playground and then getting all this attention does work against them. They are both sent to a school St. Joseph's in suburban Chicago that produced Isiah Thomas. It is a school that has been incredibly successful with an incredibly intense Coach who looks a little like a cross between Joe Paternor and Alfred Molina. He rants and intimidates and doesn't seem to individualize much. One of the young men doesn't have the financial wherewithal or the more observable talent and has to leave returning to his old school. It is implied that The second is a more mature player but when a knee injury enters the picture he begins to lose his confidence and doesn't reach the level of performance that he had hoped. This is a cutthroat business which is made obvious. St. Joseph won't even release the boy's transcripts until he pays up. His parents have to get on a payment plan and then it takes time. This is important because in order to get any kind of a scholarship or to even enter another school he needs these to graduate. Basketball is everything. I won't go into all the details. Those before me have done that. I want to compliment the effort and time that went into this presentation. We see so much of the humanity of a culture so different from most of ours. The filmmakers and the participants have put their hearts and souls for us to see. It's not always pretty but they were willing to give that much of themselves. See this. It took me over twenty years to check it out. I am in awe.".

Juxtaposing typical tourist views with searingly challenging economic conditions of Jamaican natives the audience begins to see a side of this culture normally hidden away.Hearing representatives from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank talk one recognizes the familiar  rhetoricadministrative jargon which obscures its callous action look out for one's self first and foremost.Wellknown US companies are documented here as part of the problem.  Their motivation is to make a profit period no matter at what cost or human price. American stockholders tend here to look at and be primarily concerned with how many points their shares riseLife and Debt shows the downside of that rise.  There's a lot more to life than merely being concerned about one's self.  This film cries out for us to hear the needy call of our planetary brother and sister.  Capitalism and competition tend to be cold animalsand one buys into those concepts because they're in place and operating . . . never stopping to think that there may be an exploitative side to these activities.Stephanie Black captures that side in this documentary.  The tourists are rightly there to have a good time yet we cannot turn our backs on our neighbors.  Imposing grossly high interest rates and stipulations that cause them to sink greater into debt each year is not aiding them.  Unloosing our subsidized powered milk on their marketplace while their unsold whole milk must be poured down the drain is not being fair.When rioters and demonstrators took to the streets there and in the US against globalization I wondered what it was all about. Life and Debt helped provide a subsantive explanation.  The film is not an entertainment it is a serious thoughtprovoking film to inform.  As I sat in a nearempty movie house with some people leaving before the end of the film I wondered where was the audience?  I thought are we not all involved in this scenario?  When we buy items assembled in Jamaica do we really realize what that means in terms of free zone?When we delight in paying very low prices for items made in China Japan Mexico and the like how does that really impact  upon those countries' workers?  Life and Debt helps provide an answer.  I very much value this documentary and look forward to obtaining the dvd when released to further ponder world economic check and balances and rethink the entire concept of globalization.".

	schema:headline " Beyond the luxury hotels is the human impact";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the Jamaica the tourists see says the narrator in Stephanie Black's documentary Life and Debt a country of lush jungles clear blue water and sandy beaches. Beyond the luxury hotels however is a third world country fighting poverty crime and hopelessness. Based on the novel by Jamaica Kincaid A Small Place Life and Debt the film studies the effects of the policies of the International Monetary Fund IMF and the World Bank on the economy of Jamaica focusing on the impact of economic globalization on the dairy farmers and factory workers. Backed by a soundtrack of native reggae music Life and Debt is filled with economic facts that require some knowledge to fully understand. You don't need a master's degree in Economics however to understand the desperate faces of children in poverty the agony of farmers who can't sell their crops or the hopelessness of factory workers who earn the equivalent of thirty US dollars per week. Black interviews former Prime Minister Michael Manley who explains how the current situation came to be. When Jamaica achieved its independence in 1962 after being a colony of Great Britain for 400 years help was needed to build its economy. The International Monetary Fund IMF and the World Bank gladly supplied this money in the form of shortterm loans. These loans though came with strings attached. Subsidies to local farmers were prohibited and tariff barriers were lowered to allow cheap foreign goods to come into the country inevitably driving local industries out of business. What's remains is tourism sweatshops and fastfood chains. Manley blames the big Western powers that have used Jamaica for cheap labor and easy sales. For example thanks to huge subsidies other countries including the United States exported powdered milk to Jamaica at an excessively low price forcing the local dairy industry to shut down. He also points out that big American businesses like Chiquita Dole and Del Monte have worked to stifle exports of local Jamaican bananas. Manley asks of the IMF You ask 'In who's interest? I ask 'Who set it up? Watching this documentary it became clearer to me why thousands of people took to the streets in Seattle to protest the WTO Conference. It may not be widely known but the WTO has established ground rules that make it easier for the developed countries to market their products in third world countries. Under WTO rules1. Governments are not allowed to pass laws that favor local firms and discriminate against foreignowned corporations.2. Governments are not allowed to prevent foreign nationals from buying a controlling interest in local companies.3. Governments are not allowed to subsidize domestic companies.4. Governments are not allowed to pass laws that would provide favorable terms of trade to particular trading partners.Ralph Nader said it all when he described globalization as being the subordination of human rights environmental rights and consumer rights. The International Monetary Fund the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank now own almost every facet of the Jamaican economy and the only ones that are making money are franchises like McDonalds Wendy's and Burger King who contribute little more than unskilled low paying service jobs. If you are thinking about asking the IMF to change its policies keep in mind that any change in IMF policy requires an 80 approval and the richest nations such as the United States Western Europe Japan make up more than 80 of the vote. Life and Debt like the recent film Bowling for Columbine is onesided in your face and may appeal only to those already in agreement. However its images are so vivid that for the first time you may experience the human impact of policies that can turn the world into one big casino.".

It is a very honest and yet artistically distinguished portrait of the demise of a Caribbean nation  Jamaica. Interspersed with the cold hard facts of how the international community has loaned the country money at predatory interest rates and then dumped products on Jamaica's undeveloped markets thus destroying native industries are scenes of tourists enjoying Jamaica's bounties oblivious to the nature of the natives' distress.The woman who made this film narrates it herself and she wrote a book on the subject before she made this film. So her credentials for knowledge about the subject are very strong. She employs a few cinematic flourishes such as the blurrededgeofscreen effect when she shows poor Jamaicans digging about in a garbage dump. The soundtrack is replete with great reggae songs including the potent and topical title track.Basically this film is more important in its 90 minutes than about a hundred typically vapid Hollywood productions stacked back to back. This film teaches you something about the world  about the exploitation of the weak about the myth of the helping nature of the IMF and the World Bank and about the everyday lives of desperately poor third world people. All proponents of globalization should see this film and then be required to defend their views to the people who have been victimized by globalization's cruel and relentless march. Similarly everyone who works for the major media in the US should see this and should be ashamed of themselves for defending the policies that have contributed to the downfall of a proud and beautiful people such as those of Jamaica. And silence is the major defense employed on behalf of such policies.".

This film manages to do both by providing relevant facts increases in national debt over time predatory interest rates tied to 'development' loans from the World Bank critical industries undercut by international competition etc. and illustrating the groundlevel effects on Jamaican citizens both visually and through numerous informative interviews. The film is interspersed with scenes of oblivious American tourists enjoying their vacations at expensive Jamaican resorts safely isolated from the surrounding poverty to highlight the developed world's ignorance about the plight of Jamaica and similar underdeveloped countries.As a precondition for aid the IMF and World Bank usually require that developing countries drop any significant barriers to trade. When the doors are opened to international trade lowerpriced goods from abroad undercut local goods and eliminate the market for any industry that cannot compete with the mass production that larger economies are capable of. While opening barrierfree worldwide markets for goods and services benefits the large economies already in a position to compete on such a scale the sudden and forced introduction of 'free' trade to underdeveloped economies often disrupts domestic industries which are given no opportunity to transition. While the consumer market is suddenly flooded with relatively cheaper goods cheap enough to undercut the local competition not to benefit consumers in any way globalization fails to provide domestic producers with the inputs and capital fertilizer machinery etc. necessary to compete with producers abroad. As a result the economy is robbed of its traditional sources of income and capacity for selfsufficiency instead becoming reliant on weak foreign aid and tourism as national poverty continues to increase.".

	schema:reviewBody "To suggest that Jamaicans are stupid enough to hate the one huge source of Revenue left open to them for economic survival  the American  tourist  suggests Jamaicans are only capable of Kneejerk analysis. Crucially people go on holiday to largely experience a different cultural environment. When you return from holiday how boring it would be to tell someone about what you experienced if it is no different from a holiday you could have had in another part of the U.S.ACanadaEurope etc.. Decimating cultures and economies outside of the U.S.A. and still expect to have a lovely exhilarating and refreshing holiday seems to be contradictory. If the bullying persists unchecked eventually there is no other life experience except a U.S.A one. At what point in this farce do the major commercial and political forces in the USAEurope etc. take responsibility for their actions think they have gone too far and seek to help repair some of the damage caused by their actions. This does not even take into account the money they made from the african slave trade. Why is it acceptable for the Jews to discuss the recent past holocast and bondage in Egypt centries ago but Africans in The West must not mention how they have been ripped off for 500 years and what about reparations  just like the Jewish people after World War Two. The fact is this film shows what actually happened to Jamaica and who were the Players in attacking an essentially defenceless people. With a Socialist Government in Jamaica being hammered by the enormous hike in oil prices and the huge cost of training doctors engineers etc. to keep the country going in the 1970's  while these same essential key workers were continually enticed to North America the Jamaican Government tried to be neighbourly with its neighbour Cuba  mutual interest only 80 miles away. The bilateral assistance as I understand it was for Jamaica to help Cuba develop its Tourist industry and Cuba help out with essential skilled people doctors engineers etc.. No rational Jamaican could ever contemplate THE PEOPLE ever accepting a Totalitarian state in Jamaica if they ever understood the lasting legacy of the Slave Trade in Jamaica. USA power brokers did not see it this way and chose to decimate the Jamaican economy. Can the definition of freedom really be restricted to acting as a mimic of a citizen of U.S.A.?As pragmatic people Jamaicans continue to find ways to progress. Unfortunately with the introduction of foreign organised crimestate secret services 1970'sto ensure the toppling of the Jamaican Socialist government Jamaican criminals were trained in cocain trafficking mechanics of illegal gun purchase and use etc. hence the current socalled Yardies. The more socialist of the two main political parties has been entrusted with governing Jamaica for more than the last two terms showing who the people trust more to guide their country despite the hardships. The fraud exposed in this film is that USA can still choose to be an honourable Big Brother to Jamiaca Cuba Barbados Guyana Trinidad Brazil Chile Venezuala etc. etc. without appearing to act as a loutish bully with no honest stance towards democracy. What is the point preaching NO GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES as acceptable while hugely subsidising USA Agribusiness especially milk  see film comments. The world is asking USA to grow up and stop making itself look like it is a pirate nation that is so morally bankrupt it does not believe it matters that smaller countries see it as a bunch of LIARS. This film tries to encourage USA to see that there is an alternative  an honest honourable one. This film shows that we the Jamaicans still offer the hand of friendship to our American neighbours and as demonstrated by Colin Powel Jamaican upbringing and ethics have a basic decency which can when allowed to grow naturally MAKE THIS WORLD A BETTER PLACE FOR ALL OF US. USA promoting organised crime has once again caused problems for all of us. A previous contributer made one sensible comment  why should a USA agribusiness need to smash the remaining 5 of business in other countries producing economic refugees and the expansion of organised crime cartels smuggling people to hidden economies in Developed Economies  Europe and North America? Why promote getting rid of stable governments to produce more refugees? More piracy ? To cream off the highly trained professionals business brainsetc. to the USA economy? The small countries then have to borrow more money from USA World Bank etc. to train more professionals just to keep the country going. The USA institutions that these people go to work for would happily pay minimal compensation if the USA Government insisted on them honouring their moral obligations. The film asks the question  Is there a sensible point to perpetuating such a USA Foreign policy? Jamaicans wish sense to prevail THE POINT OF THE FILM. It is still a mystery to most Jamaicans why some USA business leaders appear to be more interested in excess CONTROL of other peoples economies culture views etc. rather than mutual benefit  exchange of ideas  bilateral trade  mutual growth. Do they really believe the summit of human existence is the American Dream. But if you do not live in America USA would you not have the Jamaican Dream the French Dream the South African Dream the Russian Dream the Chinese Dream the Irish Dream the Chilean Dream the Cuban Dream the Iranian Dream the United Nations Dream etc. etc. On what basis does the American Dream have to be foisted on the weaker nations where only a onesided dialogue is acceptable? Don't these power brokers get bored talking to themselves?".

	schema:reviewBody "Given the gushingly positive reviews this movie has received elsewhere on IMDb given the negative review I am about to give it must be clear that I must be some probig business evil white capitalist who probably drives a Hummer and kills baby seals for fun right? No not really. I am actually rather skeptical of many globalization's claims specifically how they relate to income distribution. However apparently unlike many of other commenters I actually know a thing or two about economics and refuse to be swayed by the emotionally strong but intellectually bankrupt arguments that for the most part this movie consists of.Here's a basic summary of the movie 1. Jamaica is straddled with significant debts to the IMF the movie states US 7b 2. The IMF is a mechanism created by rich white countries to keep poor dark countries poor. 3. As a tourist you will ignorantly go to Jamaica and enjoy your time. All the while most of the money you spend will go back to foreign corporations. The Jamaicans will smile at you as they serve you but secretly they mostly hate you or at least what you represent and are doing to their country.Overlay this theme with somber reggae music and implications of racism and you have a story that would make the ignorant want to join the ranks of the Molotov cocktail at any given G8 summit.Unfortunately it's pretty much complete nonsense.For example one thing that this movie states is that the IMF or some other international boogeyman forced Jamaica to devalue its currency out of some evil plot to economically enslave Jamaicans. The reality is that the previously artificially high Jamaican currency served only the Jamaican elite  the IMF's insistence that the Jamaican currency actually be subject to market forces as part of a structural adjustment program associated with the IMF loans that were intended to keep Jamaica from slipping back into the fiscal irresponsibility that got it into the position of needing to take loans in the first place ensures that the country remain an attractive destination for tourist dollars and gives strength to its export businesses.Let's not forget Jamaica is a beautiful country that can generate money through tourism pretty much as easily as Arab countries can pull oil from the ground. Jamaica had benefited from generally moderate and reasonable colonial rule and has had no significant conflicts since. It sits within enviable flight time from the wealthy USA and enjoys status as a destination for Europeans as well due to its historical ties. Its people culture and music are generally seen in a positive light. In short Jamaicans are very lucky indeed compared to say Haitians.And so the movie goes on and on. Look at the poor Jamaicans. You are a stupid and fat tourist. Don't you even consider when you flush the toilet in your hotel that some of the waste goes into the same ocean that used to bring slaves from Africa? Yes this is actually what the movie pretty much says at some point  the point of you Jamaican  since you inherited a sound governmental and educational system from Great Britain why can't you set up proper laws to prevent this if you are so concerned? is nowhere to be found. In short according to this movie everything that happens bad to Jamaica is not Jamaica's fault. Its America's fault that Jamaica's farmers use inefficient and ancient farming methods to the point where they can't even compete with imported food even given the Jamaican currency weakness and relative ease of transport. Large foreign businesses are evil because they both set up shop there to exploit local Jamaicans by giving them jobs and then by pull out when corruption and inefficiency make them unprofitable.Jamaica has relatively high literacy partly a colonial legacy. It also has high levels of fundamentalist religiosity and substance abuse  two factors that the film doesn't really go into since well that would be far harder than just pointing fingers. I feel sorry for the people of Jamaica. Theirs is no easy life. But to put the blame on tourists and the IMF arguably the two things that are actually keeping the country afloat and not disintegrating into Haiti is perverse. Don't fall for this movie's propaganda.".

It is visually spectacular with a strong Eastern European aesthetic that one can't look away from. The Banishment is no less a film.This is a much more ambitious effort than Zvyagintev's debut. Again he has crafted a story that is highly enigmatic. It stars Konstantin Lavronenko who played the role of the absent father returned in The Return. Alex is a man with a shady past and his brother Mark Aleksandr Baluyev is of the same ilk. When Alex's wife Vera Maria Bonnevie reveals she is pregnant and that he is not the father a sequence of events unfolds that will have you on the edge of your seat. If you want to kill kill. If you want to forgive forgive says Mark.The tension is palpable magnified by the sparse dialogue. In one sense words are not needed as the body language says it all. Yet in another the inability of the protagonists to bring out into the open what needs to be said leads to unforeseen consequences. This is both thematically similar to Nuri Bilge Ceylan's similarly excellent Three Monkeys and stylistically they also share much in common. As in Ceylan's films Zvyagintev shows great confidence in telling a story taking his time to create a palpable ambiance. At 157 minutes the film is quite long but always engaging.The cinematography is stunning throughout with excellent use of the widescreen. There is one tracking shot in particular that left me breathless as the camera seemingly floated through space. I can recall only twice where the camera movement impressed me so the caravan sequence in Noise and the various tracking shots in Soy Cuba. The use of darkness light and shade are used to great effect. The music is haunting reminding me of the Gothic sounds of the music of Enigma. It renders the film with a sense of tragedy of biblical proportions.Zvyagintev is a magnificent talent that just can't be ignored. If you see only one Russian film this year make it The Banishment.".

In Krzysztof Kieslowski's Blue set to the musical score sung towards the end of the film a choral musical piece sings the words If I have not love I am nothing from the same Biblical chapter commenting indirectly on communication breakdown between husband and wife and the slow and painful reconciliation with the husband's lover.

Soon after the wife's proclamation we see her children playing with the jigsaw puzzle depicting an angel appearing to Virgin Mary mother of Jesus that she will bear a child. These clues indicate to the viewer that wife was innocent. In the movie these are but a few of the dozens of symbols and metaphors that extend even to the selection of classical music.

	schema:reviewBody "Andrey Zvyagintsev's The Banishment is a stark grave allegory of marital and familial disintegration. The father Alexander Best Actor at Cannes 2007 Konstantin Lavronenkoa slight lithe laconic characterfaces an unconscionable choice midway through the film. His wife Vera Maria Bonnevie is a quietly tired mother masking a great deal of uncertainty behind pained eyes and faded beauty. Their young children Kir and Eva sense that a storm is brewing. This is Zvyagintsev's despairing poetry on the toxic disconnect between loved ones surveying the limbo between the way things are and the way it should be.I'm pregnant but it's not yours Vera says unhurriedly looking at her husband imploringly eyes beseeching as they lounge on the patio of Alexander's hilltop childhood home in the countryside far away from the bleak greys of the industrial city where they reside. In that moment Alexander realises the shift from mental to physical infidelity less mindful to the betrayal he refuses to talk about than he is to his pride taking a dent. For the first time the angular complexity of Lavronenko's face twists into a wordless rage that reveals his only response to the malaise rising within this marriage.Alexander meets surreptitiously with his shady brother Mark Aleksandr Baluyev a criminal sort that needed stitching up and a bullet removed from his arm in the dead of the night just days before. Mark informs Alexander of a gun he left up in a dresser at their father's home. The moral landscape opens up here with two pathsto forgive or to kill. Both choices demand a hefty price but remain acceptable as long as one is able to reconcile one's self with it.Zvyagintsev creates a dreary mood piece sustained with tension and a deeply burdening excavation of secrets and silence. There's an exploration of miscommunication here not lies. The unspoken becomes just as virulent as falsities the emotional estrangement between people becomes a source of dehumanising decay. The story of family is timeless in its essence but intermittent it's intrinsic morality however is everything. Once again the past has a way of rearing itself into the future. Just as Zvyagintsev saw profundity in the role of the Father in his mesmerising debut The Return he sees the same here in the dynamics between parents and of spouses. The themes remain similar but the religiosity of his enterprise is clunkier and more obtrusive.While the acknowledged influence is Andrei Tarkovskynature and pastoral simplicity as it relates to the inner self and the interplay of religious iconographythe resonance of the camera is plainly Zvyagintsev's. The director once again working with the cinematographer Mikhail Krichman seems incapable of framing an ugly image the open spaces of the golden countryside becomes stupefying and the creaky house itself hinges on a chasm a solitary wooden bridge is the sole connection to a world outside the confines of family. As the narrative bends and folds so does Zvyagintsev's virtuosity with visual chicaneryimages and shots blend into one another revealing the webs of space and time.For all its technical poise Zvyagintsev's story lacks the emotional veracity of his debut. From each shot right down to its script everything is so precisely composed that the film becomes antiseptic beneath the tragedy by justifying its theoretical banality with intense symbolism and inorganic actions. Characters have weight but no realitythey seem becalmed even unaffectedthey are ideas acted upon props for a rambling parable and dangerously on the verge of evoking ennui. But in spite of its inherently languorous sermon Zvyagintsev tackles the film with the cinematic prose of epic literature by enveloping the film with an aura of solemnity and disquiet.".

The father Alexander Best Actor at Cannes 2007 Konstantin Lavronenkoa slight lithe laconic characterfaces an unconscionable choice midway through the film. His wife Vera Maria Bonnevie is a quietly tired mother masking a great deal of uncertainty behind pained eyes and faded beauty. Their young children Kir and Eva sense that a storm is brewing. This is Zvyagintsev's despairing poetry on the toxic disconnect between loved ones surveying the limbo between the way things are and the way it should be.I'm pregnant but it's not yours Vera says unhurriedly looking at her husband imploringly eyes beseeching as they lounge on the patio of Alexander's hilltop childhood home in the countryside far away from the bleak greys of the industrial city where they reside. In that moment Alexander realises the shift from mental to physical infidelity less mindful to the betrayal he refuses to talk about than he is to his pride taking a dent. For the first time the angular complexity of Lavronenko's face twists into a wordless rage that reveals his only response to the malaise rising within this marriage.Alexander meets surreptitiously with his shady brother Mark Aleksandr Baluyev a criminal sort that needed stitching up and a bullet removed from his arm in the dead of the night just days before. Mark informs Alexander of a gun he left up in a dresser at their father's home. The moral landscape opens up here with two pathsto forgive or to kill. Both choices demand a hefty price but remain acceptable as long as one is able to reconcile one's self with it.Zvyagintsev creates a dreary mood piece sustained with tension and a deeply burdening excavation of secrets and silence. There's an exploration of miscommunication here not lies. The unspoken becomes just as virulent as falsities the emotional estrangement between people becomes a source of dehumanising decay. The story of family is timeless in its essence but intermittent it's intrinsic morality however is everything. Once again the past has a way of rearing itself into the future. Just as Zvyagintsev saw profundity in the role of the Father in his mesmerising debut The Return he sees the same here in the dynamics between parents and of spouses. The themes remain similar but the religiosity of his enterprise is clunkier and more obtrusive.While the acknowledged influence is Andrei Tarkovskynature and pastoral simplicity as it relates to the inner self and the interplay of religious iconographythe resonance of the camera is plainly Zvyagintsev's. The director once again working with the cinematographer Mikhail Krichman seems incapable of framing an ugly image the open spaces of the golden countryside becomes stupefying and the creaky house itself hinges on a chasm a solitary wooden bridge is the sole connection to a world outside the confines of family. As the narrative bends and folds so does Zvyagintsev's virtuosity with visual chicaneryimages and shots blend into one another revealing the webs of space and time.For all its technical poise Zvyagintsev's story lacks the emotional veracity of his debut. From each shot right down to its script everything is so precisely composed that the film becomes antiseptic beneath the tragedy by justifying its theoretical banality with intense symbolism and inorganic actions. Characters have weight but no realitythey seem becalmed even unaffectedthey are ideas acted upon props for a rambling parable and dangerously on the verge of evoking ennui. But in spite of its inherently languorous sermon Zvyagintsev tackles the film with the cinematic prose of epic literature by enveloping the film with an aura of solemnity and disquiet.";

	schema:reviewBody "Much unhappiness has come into the world because of bewilderment and things left unsaid.  Fyodor Dostoevsky This second feature film from Russian director Andrei Zvyagintsev had a lot to live up to considering how great his 2003 debut The Return was. I was really a bit skeptical going in because the advanced reviews had been mixed and I really didn't know how a director who had made such brilliant use of the Russian landscape as almost a perpetually menacing character in its own right would handle what sounded like a very indoor domestic drama. Boy was I wrong to doubt. Zvyagintsev and cinematographer Mikhail Krichman find an abundance of interesting things to shoot from drab constantly overcast sovietera industrial cities to old decaying farmsteads. I love the way these two frame and light almost every shot and the slow stalking way the camera pans and moves is almost deliberately predatory. I'd probably be mesmerized if these two shot nothing but landscapes and people for two hours with no plot whatsoever which to be fair is what the movie feels like at times considering how minimal and terse the typically Russian script is. The story revolves around a man played by Konstantin Lavronenko who also starred in the Return who moves his wife and two young children from the city to his father's old farm in the country where he expects better prospects for work. While in the country his wife reveals something that threatens to tear the family apart. Like the Return the Banishment is about the tragic consequences of the failure of individuals to make emotional contact communicate and ultimately understand each other. Unfortunately the final denouement which unravels through a few too many twists for a story this simple and sparse is really unsatisfying because it strips all the characters of any last shred of sympathy leaving the audience almost indifferent towards them. Still this was so brilliantly photographed and paced that I couldn't help but enjoy every shot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not as strong as Zvyagintsev's haunting 2003 debut 'The Return''Vozvrashcheniye' grand prize at VeniceI reviewed it when it was shown theatrically in the US the following year this adaptation of William Saroyan's 1953 novella The Laughing Matter is recognizable for its intense slowpaced style and beautiful cinematography by Mikhail Krichman. 'Izgnanie' the Russian title takes us out to a remote country house where there are thin roads grassy fields over gentle hills herds of sheep  and old friends because this is the childhood home of the protagonist Alex Konstantin Lavronenko who's brought his family out there for summer vacation. But before that and a signal of a certain disjointedness of the whole film we observe Mark Alexander Baluev Alex's obviously gangsterish brother getting him to remove a bullet from his arm. this is also the first of a series of failures to seek adequate medical treatment. Now we move to Alex with his wife Vera Maria Bonnevie taking their young son Kir Maxim Shibaev and younger daughter Eva Katya Kulkina out to the country by car.Zvagintsev certainly takes his time with every action of the film. It's as if he thought he was writing a 500page novel rather than making a movie. The effect is not so much a sense of completeness as a kind of hypnotic trance. Everything is marked by the fine clear light the frequent use of long shots and the pale blue filters that give everything a distinctive look. Some of the long landscape shots are absolutely stunning and the interior light and the way shadows gently caress the faces are almost too good to be true.When another family comes into the picture and they all spend a day outdoors the sense of familiarity summer listlessness and vague unease made me think of a play by William Inge or Tennessee Williams. That may seem odd for a Russian movie but the names are only partly Russian the location is deliberately indeterminate and Saroyan's source story is set in a longago California not in Russia. Zvyagintsev doesn't seem to work in the real world but in some kind of superreal netherland. Whether it is unforgettable or simply offputting seems to vary. In 'The Return' it as the former here it is more the latter.Vera drops a bombshell when she announces she's pregnant and that the child isn't his. The tragedy that slowly but inexorably follows arises from a derangement in the wife and a misunderstanding by the husband. To deal with the problem Alex wants the children out of the way and he is happy to have them stay at the friends' house where they're putting together a large jigsaw puzzle of Leonardo da Vinci's painting 'The Annunciation'. I'm indebted to Jay Weissberg's review in 'Variety' for this identification Weissberg adds That... isn't the only piece of heavyhanded religious imagery on offer. There's Alex washing his brother's blood off his hands EvaEve offered an apple and a Bible recitation from 1 Corinthians about love It does not insist on its own way handily set apart by a bookmark depicting Masaccio's 'The Expulsion From the Garden of Eden.' OK we get it but that doesn't mean the parallels offer a doorway into personalities who offer little emotional residue on their own. And he is right Zvyagintsev's fascination with Italian painting and here also with the Bible doesn't change the fact that the characters nonetheless remain this time troublingly opaque. Mark is an adviser and stimulus to action for Alex. Robert Dmitry Ulianov is a third brother who enters the picture later. I will not go into the details because the chief interest of the film is its slow revelations.And yet the revelations don't quite convince because for one thing they do not fully explain. The wife's behavior remains unaccountable. And a long flashback in the latter part of the film seems to come too late and to explain too much yet without explaining enough. None of this is the fault of the actors who are fine including the children.Zvyagintsev's second film then is a disappointment and a puzzlement. I began to think after a while that the whole thing would be much more effective if it were done in a very simple style with simply workmanlike photography in a film trimmed of all externals down to the bone something noirish like Robert Siodmak's 'The Killers' or Kubrick's 'The Killing.' We are left to figure things out anyway so why all the flourishes? Yet Zvyagintsev's style is nonetheless beautiful and one only hopes he finds material that works better for him next time. I was thrilled with 'The Return' and wrote of it in my IMDb Comment This stunning debut features exceptional performances by the talented young actors brilliant storytelling in a fablelike tale that's as resonant as it is specific and exquisite cinematography not quite like any one's ever seen before. The excitement I felt about the first film is why the new one feels like such a letdown.Seen as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center series Film Comment Selects 2008 February 25 at the Walter Reade Theater NYC.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a vast difference between being emotionally inert and being emotionally hollow. As much as Vozvrashcheniye The Return 2003 was intense Andrei Zvyagintsev sophomore feature Izgnanie The Banishment is hollow. An emotional hollowness that engulfs us holding us captive along with these tragic characters. I say captive because I so desperately wanted them to make things up but our nature and the choices it sometimes leads us to make often renders the tragedy inevitable. There is a great deal of silence in the film most of these moments between the husband Alexander Konstantin Lavronenko and the wife Vera Maria Bonnevie. As long as a relationship is having constant arguments of any kind I believe it is still far from the rocky paths. But once silence creeps in it usually will signal the point of no return. Izgnanie starts off with a great shot of a car running along a picturesque landscape of the Russian country. Mark Aleksandr Baluyev drives to his brother Alexander's home in the middle of the night where he has his upperarm suffering from a gun shot wound fixed and the bullet taken out. The very next day Alex and his family relocate to their countryside home amidst the breathtaking serenity of the scenery. Yet these people are banished from country Garden of Eden for there's no peace in their lives. Silence yes and a hell of a lot of it. But peace none at all. The urban world and its rush might conceal that silence but the country has its own to offer. Vera reveals to Alex that she's pregnant and the child is not his. Perhaps the external silence is too much for her to bear. Alexander is a great character and it is a great performance from Lavronenko. A classic case who has been influenced during his growing days and now is himself influential. Perhaps we all are in varying degrees. In a lesser film he would have been a stoic binary individual one of those standardetched characters that respond in only two ways. But what Alex achieves here is to capture an individual who has added layers and layers to conceal himself to conceal his vulnerability. As against popular conception the layer addition is somewhat of an involuntary task. The wife has so desperately tried to penetrate those layers and to truly know her husband all her married life. And now the vacuum is too much for her to bear. Not because she is feeling lonely but she can foresee where her son is being led to. Where her children are being led to. This is an extremely complex portrayal of parenting. Most films that intend to showcase negative parenting are loud and usually exaggerate the effects compressing them into a rather small time frame. This understands what happens and how the nature of a parent good or bad is gradually impressed upon the child. An impression that is infinitely complex than being just plain good or bad. Taare Zameen Par is juvenile in its portrayal of the parent just as no boy is bad I bet there're few parents who are bad. A father is a child's hero always. I can never overestimate the profound influence my father's persona has had on me. Vera discloses the secret herself in hope of a final attempt at breaking that shell. But it is impenetrable that shell. It is transparent but it is impenetrable. Then there's the other silence. The one that exist between the two brothers  Mark and Alexander. It is the silence that prospers between two individuals who're essentially one the kind who understand the other's every little action every little word and every little moment. These are two individuals who've been together and stayed together every step of the rocky road. And when one experiences a tragedy it is the other that suffers. It is a great study the bond between the brothers. As much as I felt captive within the vacuum of the marriage I would want to be company to these two brothers as they grew up. I would want to know if they share the same secret of brotherly loverespecthate. Outside of Tarkovsky's cinema I have never experienced such a great blend of serenity and silence. Zvyagintsev is a master who pulls of every trick of his with mathematical precision. He's ably accompanied by the cinematography of Mikhail Krichman his comrade from his debut film and they create a profound location out of the otherwise ordinary countryside. This is the Garden of Eden and with a budget that I suspect is as low as the first one it was under 500000. But what the results they achieve is worth billions the landscape here is a character on its own. The camera is essentially still and even during the occasional instances when it moves the results are essentially still. This is an extremely beautiful film to look at and that it is about such painful characters inhabiting a tragic family is all the more ironic. The secret of the breathtaking prowess of the film's effectiveness and its screenplay is that it doesn't go for plot markers. It takes its time and makes us privy to the drama as it unfolds almost in real time. Love is God it is said. And God is love. And yet these people who are incapable of overcoming their shortcomings to achieve love for one another is horrifying to a certain degree. For if God is love why doesn't he himself overcome his shortcomings and help these people out of their vacuum. One of the great films of this year.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is no doubt that the measured beauty both savage and majestic is superbly and evotically captured by the cinematography of Mikhail Krichman from start to finish both nodding to and taking hats off to undoubtedly Tarkovsky.However what started out as the short story 'Laughing Matter' by American writer William Saroyan unfortunately gets swamped by the visual bravado and a two and a half hour runtime. It gets to being on the cusp of something big or something profound that might explain what's going on  but that may be the trick that The Return director Andrey Zvyagintsev wants.With its gorgeously slow tracking shots and weaving camera angles that follow this troubled family who now are in hiding in one those idyllic Russian country houses on a windswept plain and with their own walnut grove there lies an intensity that is palpable brewing away quietly. This is helped by a sparse score notably a slightly electronically treated 'monk' sounding choral piece that rises like a sullen mist.Lead actor the Father of the family Konstantin Lavronenko picked up Best Actor at Cannes. His wife Eva announces one day that she is pregnant and through studies in male supposition and pride family bonds and shady past dealing contacts are tried  and tested. What unravels slowly are the various connotations resulting from these and their actions on both them and their existing children.My four stars are really for the sense of unfulfillment  it's neither oblique and enigmatic enough that a Tarkovsky would be but it's obvious there's a story bursting to get out and I for one would be rather happier if it weren't shrouded in quite so much masked mystery  however beautiful that mask might be. There is little dialogue very little violence and I don't recall any strong swearing but through some strong visuals possibly of body injury it's a certificate 12.For followers of Russian cinema old and new then The Banishment is certainly worth watching and for those like me who enjoyed Zvyagintsev's The Return it's almost a must. The critics were largely underwhelmed and I so wish I could say that this is a masterpiece but sadly it's not quite.".

It gets to being on the cusp of something big or something profound that might explain what's going on  but that may be the trick that The Return director Andrey Zvyagintsev wants.With its gorgeously slow tracking shots and weaving camera angles that follow this troubled family who now are in hiding in one those idyllic Russian country houses on a windswept plain and with their own walnut grove there lies an intensity that is palpable brewing away quietly. This is helped by a sparse score notably a slightly electronically treated 'monk' sounding choral piece that rises like a sullen mist.Lead actor the Father of the family Konstantin Lavronenko picked up Best Actor at Cannes. His wife Eva announces one day that she is pregnant and through studies in male supposition and pride family bonds and shady past dealing contacts are tried  and tested. What unravels slowly are the various connotations resulting from these and their actions on both them and their existing children.My four stars are really for the sense of unfulfillment  it's neither oblique and enigmatic enough that a Tarkovsky would be but it's obvious there's a story bursting to get out and I for one would be rather happier if it weren't shrouded in quite so much masked mystery  however beautiful that mask might be. There is little dialogue very little violence and I don't recall any strong swearing but through some strong visuals possibly of body injury it's a certificate 12.For followers of Russian cinema old and new then The Banishment is certainly worth watching and for those like me who enjoyed Zvyagintsev's The Return it's almost a must. The critics were largely underwhelmed and I so wish I could say that this is a masterpiece but sadly it's not quite.";

	schema:reviewBody "A respectable family drama with its style and lethargic editing its main drawback Izgnanie will also definitely test the patient even Andrei Zvyagintsev's most loyal of fans. Insecurity over the plot is palpable as film overextends its welcome with pondering and introspective filming that doesn't quite translate well on screen. Plot and cinematography especially in the countryside offer some solace to art house fans however audience will wonder why it took too long to make the point.Film follows a middle class family as they go to the pastoral countryside presumably where the paternal character Alex Konstantin Lavronenko grew up. Plot only advances approximately an hour in the picture as a reveal is introduced. Character and story development is sporadic definitely welcome as it reminds audience that they aren't watching paint dry. The final act in the film a flashback carries the meatier part of the movie as it emphasizes the tragedy that happens earlier. Adultery abortion and family secrets are aplenty however seen and are better executed before.Best actor nod for Konstantin Lavronenko at Cannes 2007 is somewhat deserving. It is indeed a subtle performance however doesn't hold a candle to other actors vying for the same gong.With an abundance of establishing shots and transport moving in and out of frame the film could have easily eliminated 30 minutes of its 2 and a halfhour running time. Anna Mass the editor has puzzled together a film that wallows in atmosphere and creates images that are borderline pseudocathartic. Such scenes include a 3minute trailing shot of water flowing from a water source that stopped delivering hydration before. May have functioned as time change and indication of liminal moment but overly indulgent nonetheless as it feels that it's delivered as art for art's sake.Adapted from a novel by William Saroyan it is clear that translation is also a problem. With the production of the film being abject to the characters audience is clearly not allowed into these personalities only as observers. This abjectivity produces lack of engagement that a plot like this could easily flourish on. From the outside characters are clearly sophisticated enough and it is curious why connection never gets there.English title is marketed as The Banishment as it may signify a plethora of themes and undertones in the movie. It straight up refers to the family's eviction from their 'idealised' Eden in a midtown neighborhood although clearly far from it as it is depicted as violent and drab but also refers to the individual isolation of the characters from one another. They are all devoid of communication or any sort of outward emotional connection except for hate contempt and the chains of nuclear family. Film becomes a burning effigy to families that are only bonded because they have to.What could have been a beautifully insightful movie on the danger of disregard of family bonds film overachieves in being meditative to a fault dragging its run time to way beyond its limits diluting its intended purpose. The patient will find satisfaction but will still notice the film's over the top brooding by overstuffing it with nonconsequential establishing shots pretending to be worth more than it is.".

Zvyagintsev's film is a minormasterpiece a film combining the essence of each of the above films with various cues from that of something like Coppola's Godfather films the studious deconstruction of a family unit not all of them necessarily criminally minded slowly painfully deathfully falling apart at the seams as those of varying genders ages and backgrounds fall away from one another because of a troup of men's actions. It is a rigorously immersive film a fine effort from a man firing on mostly all the cylinders he decides to shoot from the end product formulating into a morbidly fascinating procession of drama and character.The film will begin with a car being driven by a wounded man through rural fields split by the tarmac road his car occupies the trees and birdsong unpleasantly disturbed by the roar of the car as it hares by. After another instance of countryside peace being disturbed an unperturbed cut will see the car enter a more urbanised locale full of bricked up walls and factory chimneys churning out reams of smoke.

	schema:reviewBody "First off I'm gonna say there are a few reviews without a tag which do spoil a bit. The movie has a couple of scenes which make the plot and it's far better viewing if you don't know about them. I'm not gonna go into details but I'm still putting the spoiler tag on.This movie had pretty much everything for me to like it. It's a Russian film I catch one every time I can. It was nominated in Cannes it's slow paced it's got great cinematography and it's a movie that requires you're brain to be turned on rather than off. Even if slow you really need to be awake for the whole duration.Still it didn't turn out quite as good as I hoped. I had no problem with the duration it never felt too slow or dragging. Very little actually happens plot wise. The tension and atmosphere are hand felt. Acting top notch lot's of symbolic references. Scenery and images are amazing. There are a couple of scenes where the camera work really goes into Tarkovsky territory.The story is intriguing and gripping but never really hits it. It's a mystery and a lot of stuff remain unsaid on screen and off screen. May require repeated viewing but I felt the story left a bit too much in the shadows. I have nothing against clues and symbolism but here the story is just too enigmatic. You also start to question the characters actions after a while. If in a horror movie you say why is she going there alone in this movie you say why don't they just talk.Might also be cultural differences but I had a bit of trouble connecting to anyone in this movie and if you have to question every characters actions the viewing experience becomes a bit heavy after a while. You're never really sure why they do what they are doing.Speaking of cultural differences I try to catch a Russian movie every time I can because it's amazingly difficult to find a subtitled Russian movie in Finland. I was a bit disappointed how universal this movie was. It could've happened anywhere and reading from IMDb the shooting locations were not in Russia. Without the dialogs I would've never guessed it's a Russian movie in my book that's not a good thing for a movie.Still definitely worth viewing I'm gonna try and catch the directors earlier movie and will keep an eye on him in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Russian film Izgnanie was shown in the U.S. with the title Banishment. It was directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev. The movie stars Konstantin Lavronenko as Alexander and Aleksandr Baluev as his brother Mark. Maria Bonnevie portrays Vera Aleksander's beautiful wife. Although her name sounds French Bonnevie is NorwegianSwedish. I don't know whether she speaks Russian or whether her voice was dubbed.The film starts and ends with an automobile racing along country roads and then into the city. These almost identical scenes frame a fascinating complex narrative.I think the title accurately translated as Banishment is misleading. Well at least it's misleading in English. To me the title implies someone being forced to leave one location and go to another. It's true that Alexander and Vera leave the city and go to a rural area where they have a home. It's not a dachait's an old farmhouse inherited from Alexander's father. Still they're not forced to go.After they arrive in the farmhouse we get hints that something's not right in their lives but we don't know what it is. We get a clue that the brothers may be criminals but we never learn just what they do that is illegal.At first Vera appears to be an ideal wife and mother but the situation is much more complex than that.This is a long movie but it's never boring. Director Zvyagintsev likes to hold scenes after the main action has taken place. In this context it's very effective. He also knows how to direct his actors especially the three leads. Their acting is outstanding.We saw this movie in 35mm at Rochester's superb Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman Museum. The Dryden showed three films by Zvyagintsev on consecutive Wednesdays. My compliments to the Dryden for sustaining this high level of programming. The movie will work better on the large screen but it's good enough to be sought out and seen on the small screen. The film has an excellent IMDb rating of 7.7. I think it's even better than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "A family with two preteen children go to spend some days in the isolated country house where the father was born and raised. The first hours are spent bringing the house back to a minimum of working order with the children spending much of their time outside in the garden as children do. And then in the evening after dinner when the children have gone to bed and the adults sit on the terrace on their own the wife tells her husband something very short and simple that will overhaul his life and set the mood for the rest of the film. Those looking for easy entertainment better look elsewhere. The first simple and bleak images and the music already let you know that this is not going to be a relaxing experience. There is tension from the beginning and it is there to stay until the end. This is beautiful artful cinema making of the kind that requires spectators to approach it with their emotions and an open mind. Perhaps demanding cinema. Though not overly intellectual the story is in some ways quite a simple one it contains powerful undercurrents that are not obvious until the very end. Like most good films you will get more out of this watching it more than once. Astounding acting by the three main actors. The range of feelings displayed by actors Konstantin Lavronenko and Maria Bonnevie as the married couple and by Aleksandr Baluev Konstantin's brother in the film and perhaps alter ego is breathtaking. Bonnevie looks totally natural even if dubbed chapeau to her. Lavronenko deservedly got Canne's Best Actor prize in 2007 for his role in this film. Zvyagintsev's craft as shown by his other films is felt from beginning to end with exquisite attention paid to detail light colour shadows filming locations. As with good art everyone will get something different out of this film. Leaving aside some possible religious or spiritual connotations I take it that this film contains a reflection on love and the absence of it about sharing and its limits that can speak to very wide audiences irrespective of time and location.".

	schema:reviewBody "The two and a half hour run time didn't seem like much given how absolutely captivated I was by the breathtaking images in this film. Many of the shots were so beautiful and more importantly meaningful that they reminded me of some of the great oil paintings I've had the pleasure of observing as an art connoisseur. The scene of the children asleep on the train in their parents clutch portrayed a powerful sense of innocence and security foreshadowing what feelings would soon be put to the test.. Or the shot of Vera in a virginblue colored dress sitting in contemplation on her bed. The usage of color gives rise to a new definition of pastoral of the quality of a pastel. These being just two of many examples of how such stunning imagery works in the film's favor and remaining entirely relevant. Yes the beauty of the film was even enough to keep me viewing even when I started to lose my comprehension and understanding of what was going on in the final thirty minutes of the actual plot. When this occurred I was left wondering if I was really so short sighted or if the director made something that was simply complicated and required a second viewing. Upon research and reflection it appears there is nothing at all complicated about the story. If anything the confusion was a result of how shrouded in mystery the wife's actions were. This along with the sneakily added flashback scene at the end. It took a while to even realize I was watching a flashback and it was almost intentionally tricky to follow. This was frustrating as I had invested two hours of my time into the movie only to be thrown into a mild state of confusion at the last minute. But even if you agree to label the flashback criticism as my own inept comprehension let me come back again to the real source of frustration The wife's actions. I simply cannot fathom how anyone in their right mind haha I just realized mid sentence that maybe she WASN'T in her right mind. And oh my god... I don't think the women in the adapted novel this was based off of was in her right mind either! Actually of course she wasn't in her right mind! She killed herself and her baby for Pete's sake! This explains everything! Please forgive my real time realizations midreview perhaps this will serve as more enjoyable or enlightening for any readers. I write these in part to enhance my own understanding.When I first became aware Alex was in fact the biological father I was in shock and almost disgusted with frustration over how Vera told him that it wasn't his. How stupid could she be? I thought? Why would she NOT deny Alex's misguided thought that she was adulterous? Who in their right mind would do such a thing?! And that's the AHA! moment! She WASN'T in her right mind at all! And that my peers of the internet solves the enigma that is frustrating even the most astute of reviewers. It is so simple actually...As simple as a shot of water coursing through driedup Earth.And boy am I glad...because when I first saw this movie I was pouring over reviews trying to find reason and accountability for Vera. It took my own serious reflection with THIS written review to realize it. And...maybe I'm wrong? Maybe my realization is just as inept as my firstwatch comprehension ability? But for me my interpretation makes sense...With a reason discovered for Vera's actions the movie's narrative becomes as beautiful as its cinematography... I recall one of my favorite movies ever Tarkovsky's Zerkalo to be in a similar vein Demanding from it's viewer.".

Yes the beauty of the film was even enough to keep me viewing even when I started to lose my comprehension and understanding of what was going on in the final thirty minutes of the actual plot. When this occurred I was left wondering if I was really so short sighted or if the director made something that was simply complicated and required a second viewing. Upon research and reflection it appears there is nothing at all complicated about the story. If anything the confusion was a result of how shrouded in mystery the wife's actions were. This along with the sneakily added flashback scene at the end. It took a while to even realize I was watching a flashback and it was almost intentionally tricky to follow. This was frustrating as I had invested two hours of my time into the movie only to be thrown into a mild state of confusion at the last minute. But even if you agree to label the flashback criticism as my own inept comprehension let me come back again to the real source of frustration The wife's actions. I simply cannot fathom how anyone in their right mind haha I just realized mid sentence that maybe she WASN'T in her right mind. And oh my god... I don't think the women in the adapted novel this was based off of was in her right mind either! Actually of course she wasn't in her right mind! She killed herself and her baby for Pete's sake! This explains everything! Please forgive my real time realizations midreview perhaps this will serve as more enjoyable or enlightening for any readers. I write these in part to enhance my own understanding.When I first became aware Alex was in fact the biological father I was in shock and almost disgusted with frustration over how Vera told him that it wasn't his. How stupid could she be? I thought? Why would she NOT deny Alex's misguided thought that she was adulterous? Who in their right mind would do such a thing?! And that's the AHA! moment! She WASN'T in her right mind at all! And that my peers of the internet solves the enigma that is frustrating even the most astute of reviewers. It is so simple actually...As simple as a shot of water coursing through driedup Earth.And boy am I glad...because when I first saw this movie I was pouring over reviews trying to find reason and accountability for Vera. It took my own serious reflection with THIS written review to realize it. And...maybe I'm wrong? Maybe my realization is just as inept as my firstwatch comprehension ability? But for me my interpretation makes sense...With a reason discovered for Vera's actions the movie's narrative becomes as beautiful as its cinematography... I recall one of my favorite movies ever Tarkovsky's Zerkalo to be in a similar vein Demanding from it's viewer.";

Tarkovsky's films are always too slow and heavy to watch with its long lingering shots that at its best only make for mental masturbation. I was really worried that the director of banishment would follow Tarkovsky's steps after first seeing the selfindulgent lingering shots and he did more and more of those later in the film. I think the return is a perfect film without any unnecessary conversations or lingering shots but this movie failed to carry the flag of the first one. All in all the excessive twists of the plot and the pretentious religious symbolism are drawbacks of this otherwise spectacular film despite the stunning cinematography perfect editing and imposing style.

	schema:reviewBody "Latin American politics has moved markedly leftward in recent years. The shift might have extended as far north as Mexico had Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador not been defeated in a muchcontested election in 2006. A Wikipedia History of South America gives the following list of left wing South American presidents by date of election Hugo Chvez of Venezuela 1998 Ricardo Lagos and later Michelle Bachelet of Chile 1999 2006 Lus Incio Lula da Silva of Brazil 2002 and Lucio Gutirrez and Rafael Correa of Ecuador 2002 2006 Nstor Kirchner of Argentina succeeded by his wife Cristina 2003 and 2007 Tabar Vzquez and Jos Mujica of Uruguay 2004 and 2008 Evo Morales of Bolivia 2005 and Fernando Lugo of Paraguay 2008. The remaining strong rightwing government in the region is Colombia coincidentally the closest US ally there. This group isn't monolithic. Some are populist and international in focus like the most visible figure Chvez others like Lula and the Kirchners are more focused on local problems. As the Wikipedia article points out in 2008 the Union of South American Nations was formed aiming to function like the European Union it is a decisive signal of the end of US hegemony in the region. The days may be over when the CIA can conduct a boldfaced coup like the ouster and killing of Salvador Allende in Chile September 11 1973 replacing him with a rightwing leader Augusto Pinochet friendly to the US and to business interests. As Wikipedia points out In the 1960s and 1970s the governments of Argentina Brazil Chile and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.aligned military dictatorships. And then of course there is the scandal of IranContra during the Reagan era of the Eighties symbolic of the US' selfinterested antiprogressive role in various conflicts such as those of Nicaragua and El Salvador.One reason for the shift to the left and the rise of more democratically elected governments is the economic problems brought about by neoliberal i.e. marketbased policies that benefited the rich nations and further impoverished the South. The presence of former bishop Fernando Lugo may attest to the political influence of Liberation Theology in Latin America since the Fifties and Sixties an activist philosophy linking Catholic faith with the struggle for the rights of the poor and dispossessed.North Americans don't know a lot about these developments and it's hard to be informed about them from a US perspective especially if one does not know Spanish. US government policy has long favored any malleable proAmerican regime and views favorable to other regimes are hard to find on the Englishlanguage Web or mainstream media. The new leftleaning group of Latin American governments is despised in Washington circles precisely because its members are if not strongly at odds with the US like Cuba or Venezuela no longer willing to bow to the major USdominated economic forces represented by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It is easy to find criticisms of the new leaders especially of Hugo Chvez on the Englishlanguage Internet.Into this scene comes Oliver Stone's new documentary 'South of the Border' which focuses on Chvez Morales and several others he does not interview all of the dozen leaders listed above. To cover them all with their individual national issues would be a daunting task for an 85minute film. It is a mixed blessing to have Stone's film available to US audiences. Predictably it has been ruthlessly attacked by the American press and reviewers. Unfortunately Stone is an easy mark. Much of his information is valid. But in the voiceover narration he repeatedly mispronounced Chvez as Chavz accents do matter in Spanish names and even George Bush got this one right. Stone has only one talking head his political adviser on the film Tariq Ali a London born leftist with a recent book on this subject who has a tendency to sound strident and dogmatic. Stone makes elementary errors like saying they are flying over the Andes when for the most part they are not. He is entirely too chummy with the leaders congratulating them shaking their hands and hugging them on camera in a manner that is not only a revelation of bias but vaguely condescending.There is also the problem of proportion. In the brief film Stone devotes at least twenty minutes to the story of Chvez's rise and the debates over coverage of the 2002 coup  time that might better have been spent presenting new material about the other leaders about whom we know less.The Chvez coup has already been covered elsewhere in Bartley and O'Briain's 'Revolution Will Not Be Televised' 2003. The virulent response I received from the antiChvez camp in Caracas from my review on IMDb at that time showed how extreme the polarization is. This camp is particularly eager to propagandize against Bartley and O'Brian because their film is quite convincing. Stone has not done better.South America is rife with class conflict and wealth remains in the hands of the few while many are impoverished. The advantage of Chvez Morales and the others is that the poor are the vast majority. The opposition may resemble the enemies of the Egyptian leader and man of the people Gamal Abdel Nasser whom in my view Chvez resembles. Both carried out many reforms benefiting the people sought to be world leaders dominating neighboring nations and viewed favorably the idea of ruling for life.One would like to know more about how the other new left leaders differ from Chvez and more about all their specific accomplishments and specific criticisms of them. Stone's coverage of the various countries he misses several does not involve anonymous investigation only showpiece sessions with the leaders before an audience.Oliver Stone should be applauded for making 'South of the Border' and for Americans interested in Latin American politics it's a mustsee. But one wishes Stone had made a film of more depth and thoroughness.".

As Wikipedia points out In the 1960s and 1970s the governments of Argentina Brazil Chile and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.aligned military dictatorships. And then of course there is the scandal of IranContra during the Reagan era of the Eighties symbolic of the US' selfinterested antiprogressive role in various conflicts such as those of Nicaragua and El Salvador.One reason for the shift to the left and the rise of more democratically elected governments is the economic problems brought about by neoliberal i.e. marketbased policies that benefited the rich nations and further impoverished the South. The presence of former bishop Fernando Lugo may attest to the political influence of Liberation Theology in Latin America since the Fifties and Sixties an activist philosophy linking Catholic faith with the struggle for the rights of the poor and dispossessed.North Americans don't know a lot about these developments and it's hard to be informed about them from a US perspective especially if one does not know Spanish. US government policy has long favored any malleable proAmerican regime and views favorable to other regimes are hard to find on the Englishlanguage Web or mainstream media. The new leftleaning group of Latin American governments is despised in Washington circles precisely because its members are if not strongly at odds with the US like Cuba or Venezuela no longer willing to bow to the major USdominated economic forces represented by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It is easy to find criticisms of the new leaders especially of Hugo Chvez on the Englishlanguage Internet.Into this scene comes Oliver Stone's new documentary 'South of the Border' which focuses on Chvez Morales and several others he does not interview all of the dozen leaders listed above. To cover them all with their individual national issues would be a daunting task for an 85minute film. It is a mixed blessing to have Stone's film available to US audiences. Predictably it has been ruthlessly attacked by the American press and reviewers. Unfortunately Stone is an easy mark. Much of his information is valid. But in the voiceover narration he repeatedly mispronounced Chvez as Chavz accents do matter in Spanish names and even George Bush got this one right. Stone has only one talking head his political adviser on the film Tariq Ali a London born leftist with a recent book on this subject who has a tendency to sound strident and dogmatic. Stone makes elementary errors like saying they are flying over the Andes when for the most part they are not. He is entirely too chummy with the leaders congratulating them shaking their hands and hugging them on camera in a manner that is not only a revelation of bias but vaguely condescending.There is also the problem of proportion. In the brief film Stone devotes at least twenty minutes to the story of Chvez's rise and the debates over coverage of the 2002 coup  time that might better have been spent presenting new material about the other leaders about whom we know less.The Chvez coup has already been covered elsewhere in Bartley and O'Briain's 'Revolution Will Not Be Televised' 2003. The virulent response I received from the antiChvez camp in Caracas from my review on IMDb at that time showed how extreme the polarization is. This camp is particularly eager to propagandize against Bartley and O'Brian because their film is quite convincing. Stone has not done better.South America is rife with class conflict and wealth remains in the hands of the few while many are impoverished. The advantage of Chvez Morales and the others is that the poor are the vast majority. The opposition may resemble the enemies of the Egyptian leader and man of the people Gamal Abdel Nasser whom in my view Chvez resembles. Both carried out many reforms benefiting the people sought to be world leaders dominating neighboring nations and viewed favorably the idea of ruling for life.One would like to know more about how the other new left leaders differ from Chvez and more about all their specific accomplishments and specific criticisms of them. Stone's coverage of the various countries he misses several does not involve anonymous investigation only showpiece sessions with the leaders before an audience.Oliver Stone should be applauded for making 'South of the Border' and for Americans interested in Latin American politics it's a mustsee. But one wishes Stone had made a film of more depth and thoroughness.";

The film is basically an overview of the democratic leftist rise in Latin America in the past decade. The leaders speak for themselves through interviews with Stone affording somewhat of a personal look at who they are. It is certainly refreshing to listen to these leaders speak candidly and authentically about the global economy and the state of their respective countries. Free from the restraints of lobbyists or corporate interests these leaders come off genuinely passionate about the welfare of the people first. Chavez makes reference in the film expressing hope that such a leader could one day emerge in the U.S. in the mold of an FDR type. Stone captures the way these leaders care for each others wellbeing as well as a desire for regional unity and cooperation an encouraging sign for the future. Lula's segment was especially brilliant  he is decades ahead of his time. A number of Venezuelan and other S.American nationals were in attendance at the screening and many voiced their sincere thanks to Mr. Stone for backing a project that simply illustrates the truth of what these leaders stand for  a more inclusive and unified road to development in Latin America. I urge all of you that feel the need to relentlessly bash Stone socialism and these leaders to put your own psychological dysfunctions aside and look at facts. It's not even all that necessary for you to think critically just address fact. Latin America suffered under extreme poverty before these leaders and there is no instantaneous solution. A relentless resistance has thwarted the movement at every turn as these leaders attempt to move independently of IMF led development strategy. There is no question that Chavez has an uncomfortable and often autocratic style but he is surely not a dictator in his actual governance. Chavez will not compromise and will not put on a mask an it is precisely this which has elevated other nations in the region to follow suit. These leaders withstand unfathomable international pressure and they deserve all the credit in the world for what they have done in less than a decade in terms of socialist development. The fact that Mr. Stone has attempted to bring these truths to a larger U.S. audience is necessary and timely. It is a wonderful introduction intended for a U.S. audience who is largely misled about what his happening South of the Border. Excellent work".

Of course we have heard mostly criticism of these leaders  of which Stone shows an example from a Fox News talk show  so this documentary IS the alternative view.

So why do I have to go to a theater to see it? This information should be on 60 Minutes or PBS at the least. And why the shallow critical dismissal from such supposed media luminaries as the NY Times and LA Times while the mindless pablum that dominates the major theaters is being discussed as if it comprises more than 90 minutes of cinematic wanking? South Of The Border contains real conversations with the men that our corporate owned government is trying to paint as tyrants and petty dictators. They are in fact the duly elected leaders of a revolutionary trend started by Fidel Castro and renewed by Hugo Chavez. They have ousted the empire and proved they can function just fine without our imperialist interventions. They have also disproved the myth of free market solutions for their societal problems. Perhaps this is the reason the official word is no word at all. Socialism is scary especially when it makes people lives better.This film is one of the few moments of reality you're likely to see on the big screen right now. So catch it or at least get the DVD.Ignore the critics this time. Better to trust their opinions on who should play the next Hulk than on matters of political relevance.".

He interviews many elected officials all of whom seem to be pretty enlightened guys just like Stone. But they are politicians each tooting their own horn  one couldn't expect any less. Big meaningful progressive issues are bandied about with revolutionary relish. And Stone could not be less inclined to investigate the ground beneath their feet.If all this great stuff is happening in South America I couldn't be happier. But knowing how the world works I found it difficult to swallow all of the rhetoric as easily as Stone. His ear is surely closer to the ground than Fox CNN or the NYT. But what does he need to do as a filmmaker to convince his audience of his point of view? He needs to show the proof in the pudding. Lets see the beans in the burrito. Not just the guacamole sauce.How are these political changes working for the citizens? Let's hear it from the ground up Oliver. How is Bolivarianism actually achieved within a 21st century global economy? I want to SEE this. If it is happening why not show the nuts and bolts? Why not interview the newly empowered taxpaying residents and let them show the world how the new policies are changing their lives? To hear politicians gush about it will only move audiences to skepticism. By faith alone?  that's strictly for gringos.As a fiction and fantasy auteur it may be that Stone doesn't believe that a documentary approach can speak to the hearts and minds of a society raised on cable junk. He's probably right. But if he's a committed socialist he should work at it a little harder. Many of us are riper for it than even he may realize.".

And Stone could not be less inclined to investigate the ground beneath their feet.If all this great stuff is happening in South America I couldn't be happier. But knowing how the world works I found it difficult to swallow all of the rhetoric as easily as Stone. His ear is surely closer to the ground than Fox CNN or the NYT. But what does he need to do as a filmmaker to convince his audience of his point of view? He needs to show the proof in the pudding. Lets see the beans in the burrito. Not just the guacamole sauce.How are these political changes working for the citizens? Let's hear it from the ground up Oliver. How is Bolivarianism actually achieved within a 21st century global economy? I want to SEE this. If it is happening why not show the nuts and bolts? Why not interview the newly empowered taxpaying residents and let them show the world how the new policies are changing their lives? To hear politicians gush about it will only move audiences to skepticism. By faith alone?  that's strictly for gringos.As a fiction and fantasy auteur it may be that Stone doesn't believe that a documentary approach can speak to the hearts and minds of a society raised on cable junk. He's probably right. But if he's a committed socialist he should work at it a little harder. Many of us are riper for it than even he may realize.";

Here only President Lula and President Kirchner save the day and their dignity by advising Chavez and Stone himself to put some limits. A pamphlet made to satisfy everyone who hates Fox News  Cia. ... I also dislike them but why using their same type of dark strategies lies and misleading? Today Venezuela Bolivia and others we are still struggling with a fake democracy. That's the best proof to see Mr.Stone wasis blinded with the epiphany. Maybe that's way 90 of the documentary is presenting everything as truth and nothing but the truth. Where everyone who disagree with his Emperor is a bloody capitalist. Even myself I'm might be getting in trouble for submitting this but that's what they want from us to be afraid to live afraid... yes the same way the Bush's wanted the world to be and control it. If Mr. Stone truly believe on his other films about freedom and democracy at least he should be ashamed of this one and don't keep the change.".

At least he is right about Fox news. He seems to get almost every other fact about Chavez and Morales wrong. To make Chavez shine like a new penny Stone includes interviews with Christina and Lula. Pure farce.I was hoping to learn something about Chavez and Venezuela something that might change my opinion. I wanted to learn about the irrevocable changes to the political system there. But what I got was a pathetic excuse for Stone to schmooze with various heads of states as he toured South America as the other kind of American.This is a terrible selfserving documentary that has no place in an intelligent discussion of Chavez. There is no journalism here no fairness and nothing to learn. Just a puzzle and perhaps the end of a career for Stone.".

Stone obviously had intended to criticize the American capitalist system of global domination and show Chavez together with other Latin American leaders as an alternative. Yes the critic is quite direct although a feeling remains that the whole concept is made to be superficial in order to bring the film to a wider public with lower cognitive capacities. I know it's all about profit but still a documentary is supposed to be about the essence is it not? The whole story line and the narration make the story predictable it sounds partial whereas way too much material was taken from The Revolution Will Not Be Televised. Sometimes it seems Stone had made nothing more than a paraphrase of things already shown and told.

	schema:reviewBody "South of the Border 2009  12 out of 4 Director Oliver Stone certainly isn't shy when it comes to controversial subjects but at the same time I'm really not sure he's the one you'd want to deliver a documentary. In this film he travels to five countries in order to tell the American people that the media is evil George Bush is nothing more than Hitler and that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is one of the greatest men on the planet. Look I don't know how much truth is in this film and let's pretend that every second in the 78minute running time is nothing but the truth. That's fine but I have a hard time believing anything here because Stone clearly didn't set out to make a documentary but instead he wanted to give his political point of view without any other opinions coming in. I was a little surprised by the short running time but I guess that should be expected because we never hear from the other side and instead we just hear from the main guys as they tell us why they're so great and why the American media wants to paint them as monsters. Again I'm perfectly fine in someone telling me that these guys are angels but at the same time I want to hear from those who are trying to paint a different picture. Stone clearly wants this film to be a love story to Chavez Luis Inacio Lula de Silva Evo Morales Fernando Lugo and Rafael Correa. He interviews all of these people and they tell us all the great things they've done and inform us again that the American media has them all wrong. The film spends plenty of time telling us why Bush is evil and we hear why the American people are simply being fed lies and are too stupid to figure anything out on their own. SOUTH OF THE BORDER is a decent movie and I must admit I had a good time watching Stone interview these people. Again perhaps everything said here is true but I still want to hear from the other side. I also have a hard time with any documentary that tries to show the subjects to be down to Earth by having them do childish things. This includes a scene where Stone directs Chavez to ride a bike like a kid and another scene where he plays soccer.".

	schema:headline " THE modern film noir classic";
	schema:reviewBody "This brilliantlywritten film has everything a great film noir movie needs. First and foremost the femme fatale Rhea Malroux played with cunning accuracy by Elisabeth Shue and the sucker who gets screwed over Harry Barber played by Woody Harrelson. Another important and necessary element is the sticky hot Florida climate that adds to the erotic atmosphere. The money is the object of everyone's desire as well. Because of all this and much more Palmetto achieves what every film noir film shoots for. Thrills surprises murder and steam. Trailers and reviews made the film sound like a sex romp when in reality there isn't one nudity shot in the whole thing. Because Palmetto is not about nudity. It's more than that like any good film noir is. It's about TEASING. About strutting and never showing all the goods. Rhea Malroux struts her stuff alright but never strips. And that's much better than gratuitous sex and nudity. Much better. The film focuses more on the plot about a fake kidnapping scheme that is sure to please everyone...if it goes smoothly. And of course it doesn't. Bodies turn up and people are not who they seem. Harry Barber quickly realizes he's gotten too deep in something he never should have gotten involved in. But after serving two years of a fouryear sentence in an 8X10 jail cell for a crime he didn't commit he feels someone owes him. So he agrees to participate in a fake kidnapping that will get the wife of rich Felix Malroux 500000 dollars and Harry a nice whopping 50000. But because Harry is not naughty by nature he doesn't do well disguising his innocence and his guilt comes through sweating profusely when the DA Renick calls him in to act as reporter Harry can't take the heat. He attempts to call the whole thing off but once told the money's already been delivered he can't help it. He wants back in. E. Max Frye is the brilliance here for his script says it all. Based on an old pulp novel Just Another Sucker by European author James Hadley Chase the film is directed by Volker Schlondorff who should also be commended. The acting is first rate and purposefully overthetop by brilliant Elisabeth Shue as the best femme fatale I personally have ever seen grace the silver screen. This is not a must rent it's a must BUY!".

When he gets out of the slam he just wants his life back. But bad breaks and shifty women soon send him right back into the seamy sexy world of double deals and decadent rich folks in a steamy Florida town called PALMETTO.The plot of this movie is okay and the story moves along at a slow but steady pace. But what really makes it work is the sexual subtext of a man fighting to maintain both his moral high ground and his sexual potency while surrounded by a trio of luscious dangerous women.At first Harry Barber's biggest problem is finding a job. When he gets out of jail his loyal girl friend Nina Gina Gershon is waiting to meet him. Darkeyed Nina is the ideal best pal  friendly loving and supportive. Not only does she take Harry in she's more than willing to pay for his expenses and keep him on as her assistant until he finds a job. The sizzling tension between them is that Nina wants a docile and submissive male concubine while Harry is too macho to accept the pleasures Nina can provide. He's clearly the kind of man who feels that it's emasculating for a woman to have too much money or power in a relationship. Still Nina is so stunningly attractive and so clearly besotted with him that he almost unwillingly sinks into dependence. Watch the early morning scene where he makes coffee for Nina and tensely waits for her approval! It's pure Neanderthal male pride that drives Harry to accept a dirty job from blonde temptress Rhea Malroux. Elisabeth Shue has never ever been more radiant than in this classic noir role of the black widow. The sex scenes are sizzling precisely because Rhea is using Harry and preparing to feed on him. Yet when her spoiled step daughter Odette appears Harry is forced to pleasure not one but two of the most dangerous women in Palmetto!Frankly the ending of this movie is not very satisfying  Harry does not really triumph in the end nor does he learn the value of Nina's loyalty and support. In the end it's more of a paranoid male fantasy than a real classic thriller but still worth watching just for the sizzling sexual subtext between Harry and his three witches!".

The lack of real surprises was a problem for me as it did turn the story into rather a workmanlike affair at times.  The characters aren't great either.  Aside from Harry all the others are basic cardboard cut outs of characters rather than being well scripted people.Harrelson does a good Harry he has a sort of haggard yet oafish character here who is always one step behind and Woody can do that quite well.  Shue is OK as the supposed femme fatale but I couldn't help feel that Gershon would have done a much better job although at times Shue does look very sexy.  Sevigny and Rapaport are both good young actors but neither is really given anything to do here  especially Rapaport who has bad dialogue throughout.Overall though this is watchable and isn't bad  just routine.  It has weaknesses but it does well to ape the atmosphere and prerequisites of the genre well although it is pretty run of the mill as far as the genre goes. Still worth seeing but if you've seen more than three examples of the genre then you'll know pretty much what to expect.".

Though Palmetto has more plot twist and story misdirection than a city slicker being lost in a small town Palmetto sure leaves the viewer guessing and highly entertained. The setting of a small Florida town fits the storyline perfect thanks to Volker Schlondorff crafting it along with the James Hadley Chase novel. You finally figure the whole plot out in the end and many like myself didn't like the ending it's like starting over as Harry Barber Woody Harrelson once again finds himself in prison. This proves the old adage wrong that you learn from your mistakes but not in Harry Barber's case as he is once again screwed. Believe me you learn from experience anyone should no better than to trust a cunningbeauty Mrs. Rhea Malroux Elisabeth Shue who plans a kidnapping scheme to good to be true. Because people who plan are only planning for their benefit. So Palmetto has some very basic moral meanings to it some like Harry Barber learn the hardway and remain in mediocrity while others like Mrs. Donnelly aka Rhea Malroux crash in the end but to only drag others down with them. The twisting of the script and film's setting are probably Palmetto's better qualities. All good performances from Harrelson Shueand Gershon. Just to mention Gina Gershon and Elizabeth Shue have beauty and looks that would make any man foam at the mouth. I hope to continue to see Shue and Gershon in many films to come they were the two driving forces of Palmetto. I recommend this film to anyone but remember you must pay close attention throughout the whole film or will you be as lost as city person in the wilderness.".

I think that Palmetto deserves 7.5 stars I was surprised to find out it has just 5.6 stars.I have always liked the work of Woody Harrelson but in this movie he is great as the journalist Harry Barber. the supporting cast is very good too. The plot of the movie is about Harry Barber a journalist that is released from jail for being found innocent. After that he is going to have problems to find a job until a sexy woman proposes him to be involved in a false kidnapping for some easy money because of this Harry is going to get in a lot of troubles.I recommend you to watch this movie I found it very entertaining since the beginning until the end.".

	schema:headline " Best James Hadley Chase adaptation.";
	schema:reviewBody "Just recently I came across the late author James Hadley Chase. I was surprised at the huge number of novels he had written over the 50s and 60s. A movie I had also watched a movie earlier which was giving reference to behind the inspiration used. I decided to dwell in to the writers works and discover what made him so popular. After reading one I could not give up. I was surprised by the themes and characters that were involved in the novels. Many times it felt like I was not reading a book but watching a movie. Given the fact that his books were not long made it more easier to complete them. Many of Chase's novels have been adapted in to movies. The trend of Chase adaptations became a cult trend for french and Italian cinema. However here in the west it never took off. Novels like 'Miss Shunaway waves a wand' 'The set up' and 'Hit and run' were adapted for the big screen. Unfortunately they did not make bells ring at the box office. The novel 'Just another sucker' is made in to a movie and The theme became instantly familiar to me as the first few minutes begin to roll. The name of the novel has been changed to 'Palmetto' for the movie. As one watches on you realise the noir atmosphere is prevalent in almost every scene. An old novel's transition to modern day cinema makes an impressive outcome. Both Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Shue were perfect choices for the casting. Their performances really make the movie for what it is. Volker Schlondorff makes a sincere attempt at presenting his perception of the novel. He has incorporated all his basic understanding of the theme and there is never a feeling that a foreign director made the movie. He has made many dull moments enhanced by capturing the character's expressions. There are a few scenes and moments that make the movie longer in duration but this does not put the viewer off. It was disappointing that the movie did not have huge box office status when it released. Since the theme of kidnapping was used and one has to contend with releases like 'fargo' and 'The big lebowski' I would assume that this movie went unnoticed. I think that the reason behind its failure was directly due to the incorrect release date. Maybe a year early or late would have had some positive impact on the movie's success ratio.SPOILERS AHEAD Woody Harrelson plays Harry Barber who is released from prison after spending two years there for no reason. He considers going to Miami but his girlfriend Gina Gershon persuades him to not leave. At a bar he encounters a woman who who is the wife of a rich man by the name or Mr Malroux. She tempts him in to a fake kidnapping scheme where her step daughter Chloe Sevigny will be involved in. The ranson will be 500000 dollars. All that Harry has to do is make a phone call and send the threatening letter demanding the ransom. Initially Harry does not approve but later he convinces himself. After meeting the step daughter the plan is put ahead. The girl stays away from home for a short time and her father delivers the money in a suitcase to the location mentioned. He is later shocked to discover that the girl has been killed and he has a body to dispose of that is not easy to do. The local authorities are on the case and 1 plus 1 does not seem to be adding to two for Harry. Plus what he received was not cash at all. The situation becomes more and more sinister and paranoia begins to take over him. To his surprise he later discovers that at every step of the way more and more clues will point towards him as the culprit behind Mr Malroux's daughters disappearance. He realises eventually that he was just used for the whole plan. Eventually he has to prove his innocence to the authorities. END OF SPOILERSI could not help getting a dejavu of 'Body Heat' while watching this movie. Many situations were reminiscent of the classic. The setting of Florida too was an indicator of this. The constant sweating faces and sexual intimidating scenes also were a giveaway. But the similarities end there. Movies like 'Derailed and 'Out of time' too had a similar concept. The director has incorporated many slow moving frames which highlight plot twists and key moments which are crucial. These are a highlight and really create the right tone at certain intervals. With a running time of 1 hour and 53 minutes the movie does tend to take long to get the plot to progress. Much of the first hour is spent behind planning the kidnapping. However the second hour's pace builds up. Much of that specific portion of the movie delivers plot twists after plot twists. These makes for a very intriguing experiences as the movie progresses. The usage of a background score is very minimum. But the sleazy sounds do appear regularly at important moments because you can't have a noir movie without them. This is one of Woody Harrelson's best performances. He has managed to blend many moods and shades in to one role. We can feel sympathy for his character as well as hating him. We can sense his paranoia and unsettling feeling while just watching him. There are certain moments where one would also laugh at him. He truly did play the man in despair from the heart. Elizabeth Shue would have given any actress from the 40s and 50s a run for their money as she played a femme fatale brilliantly. Her body language and acting were just on the mark. Overall this is the perfect treat for fans of noir. I would also recommend watching it with others.".

A reading of her bio states that she gave birth the November prior to the film's February release. So assuming the actual filming didn't happen two years before releaseshe was at least a few months and more likely VERY pregnant during those sexy handup skirt scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "We do not hear much about Swiss cinema but Alain Tanner La Salamandre Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the year 2000 was once the brightest light in the New Swiss Cinema a movement that owed its allegiance to Brecht Bresson and the French New Wave. Considered one of the best of his later works Messidor is an original unpredictable and disturbing film about two alienated young women in search of freedom from society's rules. The film in its poetic sweep is reminiscent of Terence Malick's Badlands and could have been the prototype for Thelma and Louise. In Messidor two girls Jeanne Clementine Amouroux a history student from Geneva and Marie Catherine Retor a store clerk from Moudon in France go on the road together with very little money and no specific destination. Without context or structure to their lives they invent a game of trying to see who can survive the longest without money and the result is selfdestructive.The girls come from very different backgrounds but share a feeling of alienation. They meet while hitchhiking. Jeanne says she is trying to escape from the noise of the city while Marie is returning home after visiting her father in Lausanne. We learn nothing about their lives before they meet parents friends or school are barely mentioned. When Marie invites Jeanne to go on a tenmile walk to her home they decide to sleep in the woods and the next morning embark on a hitchhiking odyssey through the Swiss countryside. Through repetition of car rides with their meaningless conversations contrasted with the enchanting Swiss village and alpine scenery the film conveys the impression that we are all in a dreamlike state of walking going nowhere on a landscape that has surface beauty but no real substance.Their adventure turns grim when Marie smashes a rock into the side of the head of an assailant to thwart an attempted rape. To protect themselves in the future they steal a gun from the glove compartment of a Swiss Army officer. When Marie asks Where are we headed? Jeanne replies The usual straightahead. To no apparent end they go straight ahead engaging in haphazard unmotivated acts that defy society. They have sex together sleep in barns steal food panhandle and threaten people with their gun. Soon their description is broadcast on a popular TV program. When they realize that the police are pursuing them their quest takes on an air of quiet desperation.Messidor is a haunting personal film that authentically captures a mood of ennui. What was the girls life really about? Their conversation offers few insights and it is not clear whether or not Tanner regards his protagonists with scorn or is simply saying that if you want to live outside of the norms of society you must understand the limits of freedom. When asked what their game is Jeanne declares It is moving through empty spaces. All people look alike she says as if they didn't really exist. When the girls arrive in a typical Swiss village they sit in a park and look at people passing. Marie asks What do these people do? Where are they going? We'll never know she says. That's what's so maddening. We'll never know. What led these two intelligent young women to undertake a selfdestructive odyssey? Since they hardly talk about their lives their thoughts or their feelings we'll never know. That's what is so maddening. We'll never know.".

However the film also shows more of the realistic but negative side of the life of fugitives... though the cinematography of Messidor is fantastic with panoramic views of the Swiss countryside some of the longer visual sequences may seem extraneous to those who might be anticipating nonstop action.  Yet the game of adventure that the girls play lacks the aftertaste of Hollywood artifice seeming truly spontaneous natural and creating a more lasting impact with the resulting consequences.  Moreover the film's dialogue and characterization are strong.  Having seen Messidor I can now understand why this film is considered a classic.".

However this explains the title but not the content of this movie. Latin metere also means to butcher somebody.The films does not make it quite clear which is the reason why the two young women break out of their families. Is it because they have everything they need and they just want to experience the life of the needy? Is it a protest against bourgeois society at least we are at the end of 70ies? Are they really inspired by French or German terrorist movements as the police assumes? When she is asked by a stranger woman Marie says their reason is the experience of empty time in empty space. Thus the experiment. How far do you come with zero Swiss francs in your purse? How different are the reactions of those when you have nothing compared to earlier when you were able to pay them? Who is actually willing to give you a little salami although he hears every Sunday in church that God will appear in the form of the neediest of all brethren? No Jeanne and Marie are not Thelma and Louise. The never actually menace people. When they sit in a restaurant and eat for free they offer to work instead of paying telling frankly that they had hunger but have no money. But the owner tells them that he does not have a salvation army bow and he will now call the police. This an experience for the two girls after having made a experiment. In the next station in the grocery store they have learned that by humiliating themselves they do not reach the mercy of the other people. They just make another experiment Look we don't have money but we have that Jeanne says pointing to the military pistol that they had stolen from a Swiss army officer. And so this road movie more an inner than an outer road movie goes on. The more merciless their experiences get the harsher their next experiments turn out  and the less can the two await justness. When a group of men rape Marie Jeanne splits the skull of one of them with a stone found nearby in the forest. This was the first experience and leaded to the theft of the Army pistol. That there is an increasing chain of causality in their behavior remains unclear to the police that broadcast the couple's criminal acts which the audience believes. It is actually very hard to differentiate up to which degree Marie and Jeanne are culprits or victims. One of the last scenes where the two stay overnight in a stable Marie says that she is afraid of her feelings she would feel very happy and very depressed at once. Jeanne answers that she is flipping out. One is strongly remembered by some of the last scenes in R.W. Fassbinder's Despair which had just appeared one year before 1978. The experience of empty time in empty space leads to a trip into the light. Exactly parallel is also the endscene when Marie and Jeanne are arrested  compare the arresting of Hermann Hermann in Despair.".

It also has the incomparable Montgomery Clift who took intensity to new heights as the first in a series of great method actors in the 1950s. He really wasn't a Hitchcock kind of actor the director liked the artifice and changeability of a Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart much more but he makes the film what it is and Hitchcock surely knew it and made the most of it. When the camera in the hand of Robert Burks sweeps up to a full screen view of Clift's face and you see those glowing brooding eyes you fall under their collective spell. Yeah it's great stuff.The plot is pretty simple and amazinga priest Clift learns something in a confession that come to haunt him in unexpected and very threatening ways. Hitchcock manages to push the envelope a little as usual in this case by having an illicitseeming sexual affair be one of the keys to the plot. This implication naturally complicates the priest's life but during the main plot of the movie and in a cheery flashback for backstory. Anne Baxter the principled strong woman also not a Hitchcock forte is terrific throughout terrific the way Ingrid Bergman was in Notorious. Unlike most of Hitchcock's output there is essentially no comic relief here and the light and camerawork are equally darkand truly gorgeous.The French New Wave directors really admired this particular film of Hitchcock's and you can see why. But it is also just a great fast distressing American melodrama set in France. It's not sensational but it is spectacular one of my favorites among many by this odd brilliant auteur.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's never been satisfactorily explained why this wasn't a commercial success.  It's not a bad film.  Nor is it good in an inaccessible way. Hitchcock's explanations for its failure aren't at all convincing... NonCatholics don't know about the seal of confession he said they can't believe that a priest will sacrifice his freedom and career just to keep a secret.  Rubbish.  They can and they do.  EVERYONE knows about the seal of confession and Montgomery Clift makes Father Logan's sacrifice perfectly plausible.  Besides I've never had much time for the objection that a lead character is too good.  The one thing some people don't know about the seal of confession is that the priest can't mention the sin even to the guilty party but this is made clear enough in the film in one of the confrontations between Keller and Logan.  All such confrontations are excellent by the way.  Hitchcock also complains that audiences missed the point by hoping for Logan to tell the police what he knows a complaint which betrays a misunderstanding of audience psychology.  We NEVER hope that the hero will get out of jail by doing something dishonourable or morally wrong so long as there is some other way for the plot to be resolved THAT'S what we're hoping for.  Besides it's obvious that Logan will never break his vows.  Another reviewer says that Logan should simply say to the police The seal of confession prevents me from answering your questions but the film makes it clear he can't say even this.  It would put the police on Keller's scent and Logan feels  rightly or wrongly but at any rate plausibly  that his vows force him to be genuinely silent not nudgenudge winkwink silent.  I'm on his side here.  It's hard to feel much sympathy for the I won't say who did it but I WILL drop a hint attitude adopted by the priests of modern police dramas.So what IS wrong with I Confess?  Too much Teutonic? gravity as some have alleged?  Not enough humour?  Please.  those imposing shots of stony Quebec MAKE the film.  And let's face it Hitchcock isn't funny.  Give me this kind of thing over the leaden levity of North by Northwest any day. No the short answer is that there's NOTHING or nothing to speak of wrong with I Confess certainly nothing that explains its unpopularity.A few things weaken it a little.  If Montgomery Clift plays one of Hitchcock's most likeable characters Anne Baxter plays one of the least likeable ones I found it hard not to hope that Ruth would fall into the sea or walk in front of a bus or induce a casual passerby to strangle her.  This is okay the fact that she's irritating helps the story.  All the same her explanatory flashback DOES tend to drag and one wishes her scenes could be speeded up a little.  Then there's Dmitri Timokin's score.  It's a fine score in its way but it DRONES.  Tiomkin is never allowed to get a crescendo out of the orchestra instead the sound engineer turns up the volume every so often.Not that any of this matters much.  Overall it's one of Hitchcock's more engaging films.  The worst that can be said of it is that it's not a masterpiece nor is it among his very best.  Try it if you think that all the critical carryingon over such films as Foreign Correspondent Notorious Strangers on a Train and North by Northwest is a bit much and you long for something that isn't so theorydriven.".

Too much Teutonic? gravity as some have alleged?  Not enough humour?  Please.  those imposing shots of stony Quebec MAKE the film.  And let's face it Hitchcock isn't funny.  Give me this kind of thing over the leaden levity of North by Northwest any day. No the short answer is that there's NOTHING or nothing to speak of wrong with I Confess certainly nothing that explains its unpopularity.A few things weaken it a little.  If Montgomery Clift plays one of Hitchcock's most likeable characters Anne Baxter plays one of the least likeable ones I found it hard not to hope that Ruth would fall into the sea or walk in front of a bus or induce a casual passerby to strangle her.  This is okay the fact that she's irritating helps the story.  All the same her explanatory flashback DOES tend to drag and one wishes her scenes could be speeded up a little.  Then there's Dmitri Timokin's score.  It's a fine score in its way but it DRONES.  Tiomkin is never allowed to get a crescendo out of the orchestra instead the sound engineer turns up the volume every so often.Not that any of this matters much.  Overall it's one of Hitchcock's more engaging films.  The worst that can be said of it is that it's not a masterpiece nor is it among his very best.  Try it if you think that all the critical carryingon over such films as Foreign Correspondent Notorious Strangers on a Train and North by Northwest is a bit much and you long for something that isn't so theorydriven.";

Hitch apparently decided to leave this movie location unspecific and without recognizable landmarks and filmed it in the city of Quebec . In spite of some shortcoming  this is the picture that best reflects many of Hitchcock's puritanical ethics . Hitch plays on the senses and keeps the suspense and action in feverish pitch . All the elements for a suspenseful evening are in place and things move at an intelligent pace . The story is typical Hitch fare  an issue of wrong accusation  dual guilt  and treason that embroils a man in murder . Hitch had two of most charming actors of all Hollywood as Montgomery Clift and Anne Baxter . As a pretty good acting by Montgomery Clift as a priest falsely framed of killing and Anne Baxter as his old friend who cannot handle the situation wrought in her life by the gross injustice . Montgomery Clift drank during the shooting and his eyes appear glazed during the ferry scene  Hitchcock was a very nonconfrontational director and delegated an assistant director and Karl Malden to talk to the actor about it .

It contains many of his favorite things lamps the backs of people's heads bedposts ladies pacing in front of mantelpieces obvious symbolism architecture performing arts halls etc. More somber in tone than most Hitchcock thrillers it should not be missed by any Hitchcock fan.Nor by any Montgomery Clift fan. At one point Clift is juxtaposed against a statue of Christ dragging his cross taunted by soldiers. This could be the impishly sadistic Hitchcock poking fun at the pluggedup persona that Clift was developing for himself but Clift is nevertheless excellent as the brooding sensitive priest trapped by his own devotional vows. And of course he's physically beautiful the hair the eyes the eyebrows.Less effective although she has her moments is Anne Baxter who was a replacement for a European actress. It's too bad because it's hard to buy Baxter as the luscious Hitchcock blonde. Her hairdo is awful well it was 1953 so it's not entirely her faultand she does that line reading that she does in every movie including All About Eve where each line fades to a whisper or starts as a whisper and stays that way. Once you become aware of it you can't not notice it! She does however have at least one great OrryKelly dress and the way she snaps Yes at her husband was worth a rollback for a second viewing.The new DVD is excellent. It has a little documentary which is enjoyable if you can stand Peter Bogdanovich doing his Hitchcock impersonation. Hitchcock's daughter is also in the documentary. It's amazing how she seems to not really understand what her father was up to subtextually but she continues to enjoy his success.".

	schema:headline " A Crisis Of Conscience";
	schema:reviewBody "Murder blackmail and romance all feature strongly in Alfred Hitchcock's I Confess but the story's most compelling component is the moral dilemma faced by a Catholic priest who after hearing a murderer's confession is unable to disclose what he knows to the police. The priest's duty to honour the sanctity of the confessional is paramount but by doing so he becomes complicit in concealing the guilt of a killer and later when the priest becomes the prime suspect he's left to face not only a crisis of conscience but also the possibility that he'll be executed if he refuses to tell the police what he knows.This movie was based on Paul Anthelme's 1902 play called Nos Deux Consciences and the fact that the plot involved certain issues Catholicism the wrong man theme and reasons to mistrust the police which had preoccupied Hitchcock throughout his life makes it easy to understand the appeal that this project had for the great director and also the seriousness with which he focuses on the priest's predicament. It's this seriousness that determines the mood of the movie and also contributes to the tension that's a constant feature of everything that takes place.Father Michael Logan Montgomery Clift is a young Catholic priest in Quebec who late one night discovers the church's caretaker in one of the pews looking very distressed. Otto Keller O.E.Hasse asks Father Logan to hear his confession and in the confessional describes how he murdered a local lawyer called Villette Ovila Legare when he'd been caught in the act of stealing some money. Keller tells his wife Alma Dolly Hass what he's done and next morning goes to Villette's house as usual where he's also employed as a parttime gardener. On discovering the body he calls the police and Inspector Larrue Karl Malden and some other officers soon arrive to investigate.Father Logan also goes to the victim's house on the same morning and claims that he had an appointment to meet Villette. After he leaves Larrue sees him talking outside to Ruth Grandfort Anne Baxter in a way that raises his suspicions and later when two young girls report that they saw a priest leaving Villette's property at about the time of the murder Larrue's suspicions are reinforced.Ruth and Logan had been in a relationship before he became a priest and on one occasion after having been separated for some time had spent the night together. Logan was unaware that during his absence Ruth had married a politician named Pierre Grandfort Roger Dann and unfortunately for the young couple they were seen together by Villette who throughout the following years blackmailed Ruth.On the night of Villette's murder Logan was with Ruth because she'd sought his advice about the blackmail problem and so when he's subsequently interviewed by Larrue Logan doesn't feel able to account for his whereabouts at the time of the murder. This makes Larrue convinced of the priest's guilt and later when Ruth comes forward to provide Logan with the alibi he needs she actually makes matters worse for him because the fact that she was being blackmailed provided a strong motive for wanting to bring an end to Villette's activities by any means possible. A number of further complications and problems then follow before Logan's ordeal is finally brought to an end.I Confess is a greatlooking movie with wonderful expressionistic cinematography which perfectly complements the sombre mood of the piece. The use of numerous closeups and lowangle shots creates an unsettling atmosphere and some camera techniques such as the way that Larrue's face is revealed just before he sees Logan and Ruth together in the street create a frisson of their own.The quality of the acting is impeccable throughout but Montgomery Clift's contribution really stands out because of the dignity sensitivity and intensity that he brings to his character's anguish.".

	schema:headline " Intriguing But Talky Hitchcock Suspenser Of Priest Who Shields A Killer";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Logan is a priest in Quebec when the handyman in the church where he works confesses to a murder. To complicate things Father Logan had a grievance with the dead man. When the police come calling will he break his confessional vows to save himself ?This is a minor Hitchcock picture I guess a little too static and talky for me but it's still a good story with many interesting themes going on. If ever there was a film about guilt it's this one. Father Logan feels guilty for loving Ruth and for not reporting Otto Ruth feels guilty for ruining her marriage Otto feels guilty for what he has done and for the actions of his country Pierre feels guilty for keeping Ruth from the man she loves and so on. In Hitch's cinema pretty much everyone is guilty of something  it's our subsequent actions which either redeem or condemn us. It's not that well known that he was raised in a fairly strict Catholic household although this is one of his few films to explore religion in any detail. Whilst the concepts and conflicts are intriguing for me the movie is let down by a lack of action  there are lengthy exposition sequences and dull conversations which lead nowhere. Also Clift's method acting does not really suit Hitch's suspenseful style and it's hard to identify with a man who alternately clams up and protests his innocence. The rest of the cast are pretty solid though. Arguably the best performance is from German actor O.E. Hasse as the killer whose insistent doubt and fear that Logan will give him away to the police consumes any decency he has left. Hasse's first name was Otto the same as his character and he had an interesting if lowkey career in both European and American films notably Jean Renoir's 1962 Le Caporal Epingle. Note also the intense performance by Haas as the wife named Alma Hitch's real life wife's name who ultimately cannot bear the weight of the secret. Technically however there is a lot to enjoy here. The blackandwhite Quebec location photography by Robert Burks is firstrate throughout and the fine score by Dimitri Tiomkin is probably the best of the four he did for Hitch although the three other movies are all better. Note the subtle but inspired use of the Latin hymn Dies Irae in the creepy opening church sequence as Logan first confronts Otto. A lesser but thoughtprovoking exploration of an ageold question  can you keep a secret ? Hitch appears in one of the opening shots for his standard enigmatic cameo.".

	schema:reviewBody "As Alfred Hitchcock is my favourite director of course I would see I Confess. And on the most part I wasn't disappointed for my tastes Dmitri Tiomkin's music score is too much of a droneunusual for Tiomkin but while not among Hitchcock's finest I Confess is what I consider Hitchcock's most underratedStage Fright got that honour before I saw this though. We do know who the killer is right at the start and after the first 40 minutes it is somewhat more talky and not quite as suspenseful as other Hitchcocks there's also the unfamiliarity at the time of the Catholicism codes. It is strikingly shot helping a lot with the atmosphere and the settings and costumes are rendered nicely too. The dialogue is talky but is thoughtfully written and gripping just don't expect the wit of North By Northwest and To Catch a Thief or black humour of The Trouble with Harry and Family Plotit's not that type of film and be thankful that it isn't overwrought and stilted like Under Capricorn Juno and the Paycock and Paradine Case. The story is quite slow but very atmospheric with a suspensefulin that you wonder whether Logan will betray the confessional's secrets or not first 40 minutes and reasonably tense climax like 39 Steps and North By Northwest it is a classic wrong man story with also the idea of guilt seen in Strangers on a Train. The idea of Logan's dilemma throughout the film is one we can relate to no matter how unfamiliar it was at the time and it is relevant today I think. Hitchcock's direction is fine and so are the performances. I can see why people may not like Montgomery Clift's performance but I loved his brooding intensity and methodical nature for the difficult role he has to do a similar style of acting to Paul Newman in Torn Curtain but far more convincing. In fact for any of the actors who did any of the brooding intense roles for a Hitchcock film that aren't Cary Grant or James Stewart I consider Clift one of the better ones. Anne Baxter is very good as a less likable but just as interesting character while Karl Malden is perfectly cast and Brian Aherne does menacing and sympathetic rather well. All in all not typical for Hitchcock but it is a great film and his most underrated. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the disregarded works in Hitchcock's career. Roger Ebert in the Great Movies series has plenty of good things to say about Notorious Strangers on a Train and other films of this period but nothing on the only film Hitchcock made with Montgomery Clift Anne Baxter and Karl Malden. This picture must stand alone in his work since it is dependent on the remembrance of the past playing a decisive role in the presentday actions of the characters. A typical Hitchcock story has characters who seem to have no past at allthey seem to spring to life to fulfill the demands of the script.I Confess starts as a typical thriller then at the 42 minute mark the story comes to a halt in Robertson's office as Ruth recounts the story of how she fell in love with Michael Logan who was not fully in love with her an obvious parallel with Gene Tierney and Tyrone Power in The Razor's Edge. For 16 minutes we forget there is a murder story to unravelsurely the only time in Hitchcock's work that we are taken away so completely from the matter at hand. This is what makes I Confess a great movie and a peak in the director's career.Montgomery Clift has all the attributes of a dedicated priest and he easily distinguishes himself from the urbane sympathetic Charles Andre and the monumentally clumsy and distracted Gilles Pelletier playing the other two priests at the rectory. His solitary devotion is just as apparent when he wears a uniform in the wartime scenes. Anne Baxter has always been a favourite actress of mine from All About Eve to The Razor's Edge and she is wonderful here as a politician's wife who fails to protect her friend. Roger Dann as the husband does little it's a shame that Glenn Ford didn't play the part he would have been excellent he was born in Quebec City by the way.".

	schema:headline " Underappreciated and poignant Hitchcock gem";
	schema:reviewBody "Upon viewing in a current day context it is a genuine shame that I Confess visionary director Alfred Hitchcock's follow up to his smash hit Strangers on a Train was greeted with such a stigma of controversy and negative reaction. While it is true that having a priest as the lead character in what was essentially marketed as a suspense thriller may have been a storytelling trait slightly ahead of its time the religious connotations must have no doubt caused some mumblings of discontent back in 1953 but it does lead to a simply brilliant and unique story premise Father Michael Logan Clift hears the confession of a murder from a man working in his rectory but due to the sanctity of confession can break his trust and tell no one even when he himself is framed for the murder unable to clear his own name. Hitchcock is in familiar territory here as he revamps his trademark wrong man plot but with the interesting tweaking of the lead role  instead of the protagonist fighting to clear his name when he is wrongfully accused Father Logan must instead struggle in silence dutifully refusing to breach the confidentiality of confession. This submission of the lead character did not sit well with audiences nor Hitchcock himself when the film was first releasedbut this is ultimately what makes I Confess stand out among so many of Hitchcock's similar thrillers without ruining the plot in the slightest  the suspense element is still there albeit slightly more serious there are no light heated wisecracks here and subdued as the audience still clings to the edge of their seats wondering how Father Logan's name will be cleared without him personally attempting to clear it. And despite the complaints in regards to the film's 'forced religious messages' it is hard to comprehend the reputation as there are none really apart from the lead character being a priest. Hitchcock handles his subject matter including the priest character being suspected of murder and having an alleged love affair with just as even a hand and as careful and classy a touch as in all his other efforts.Also I Confess proves to be not only Hitchcock's last film in black and white except for Psycho seven years later but also one of his strongest films in terms of visual style and feel for the film. The Quebec location and sets are pitch perfect throughout and Hitchcock and cinematography director Robert Burks deploy subtle but innovative cinematography techniques throughout to heighten the mood making more liberal use of camera movement and extended shots of behind characters heads as if hiding their inner turmoil from the audience  a superb touch. Composer Dimitri Tiomkin's score toes the line of becoming too dramatic but it settles as being suitably powerful and affecting. The screenplay by George Tabori and William Archibald is an intelligent piece not afraid to push social boundaries given the time period though it is disappointing that the motivation of Clift's character is more often than not chalked up to martyrdom when the real intent was to demonstrate his struggle to remain faithful to his principles and faith. As usual Hitchcock also proves to be an expert actor's director as the cast turn out universally excellent performances each one emoting surprisingly genuinely and proving particularly convincing in their roles. Montgomery Clift gives a superb performance as the priest in question Father Logan remaining subtle to the point of seeming not to emote throughout yet hinting at surging emotions kept carefully under a facade of calm. Anne Baxter is also a notable presence one of the more memorable of Hitchcock's icy blondes as the mysterious woman connected with him and she manages to retain interest enough to keep the audience interested through a long and potentially hazardous and tedious voiceover flashback sequence. Karl Malden is charismatic and engaging as the police officer investigating the murder case and Brian Aherne is perfectly cast as a suave yet sleazy prosecutor. German actor O.E. Hasse debatably steals the show as the actual murderer switching from despairing to coldly logical to sadistically enjoying Father Logan's plight as he is accused of the murder they both know he did not commit. All things considered it is a real shame I Confess is one of Hitchcock's more overlooked films as the sheer quality and inventiveness bursting out of every frame should be easily enough to cement the film alongside other classic thrillers and dramatic films of the decade. Don't let the alleged religious connotations and occasional bad reviews steer you away  this is one of Hitchcock's strongest works as the unique variation on his time worn themes combined with a visually sumptuous look a quick and intelligent script and a consistently impressive cast easily make the film worth a watch. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I Confess is a landmark film in the Alfred Hitchcock collection. It is the last black and white film Hitchcock made with the notable exception of Psycho seven years later. But it was made at a time when Hitchcock was at the peak of his career. I Confess was sandwiched between internationallyacclaimed classics Strangers on a Train and Dial M for Murder. And so I Confess not being a stunning Hitchcock film fell between the cracks into that category of Hitchcock known as The Underrated Films.The Underrated Films are those films that Hitchcock made that did not meet with box office success but have been reevaluated by his next generation of fans and have been found worthy of mention most notably Topaz Stage Fright Marnie and I Confess.I Confess is definitely not standard Hitchcock. There's no really stunning visual effects apart from the excellent background photography no incredible camera angles no definitive Hitchcockian scenes. It's just a typical movie with a typical plot.That plot however is indeed the purveyor of the modern courtroom drama. A priest takes confession from a man that works in the rectory. The worker confesses he has murdered a man in a robbery attempt. The victim also happened to be blackmailing the priest and his former lover. The priest falls under suspicion and is arrested but he cannot clear himself because his religious duties forbid him to reveal what a man has confessed.True the plot hasn't aged well. Every show from Matlock to Diagnosis Murder has used it. But considering the age of the movie Going on 50 years it is safe to say that this was the source for such tales. The everpresent Hitchcock plot twist is also quite good. The verdict it should be noted that this is one of the only Hitchcock movies to feature a good portion of the trial and not just the verdictsentencing the verdict sparks public outrage and the ensuing events are shocking indeed.Overall Montgomery Cliff is excellent as the falsely accused priest and Hitchcock  although unspectacular  is still the closest thing to a perfect director the film world has seen. The plot is good the story flows well and it is a fine sendoff for Hitchcock's black and white era.910".

	schema:headline " Average For Hitchcock Good By Any Other Standard";
	schema:reviewBody "I Confess is merely an average entry in Alfred Hitchcock's filmography but it is a pretty good film by any other standard.  It has some basic weaknesses but also some major strengths that make it worthwhile.  The basic story is established early Catholic priest Father Logan Montgomery Clift hears a confession from the church caretaker who has just killed a man.  Circumstantial evidence leads to Father Logan himself being suspected but he is bound by the seal of the confessional and is unable to clear himself putting him in serious danger of being wrongly convicted.Two basic weaknesses keep I Confess from being one of Hitchcock's better works.  First too much of the plot hinges on the priest's confessional responsibility.  In itself this is an interesting plot device leading to an interesting twist on one of Hitchcock's favorite themes the wrongly accused man.  But there are not enough other significant plot elements and this one point cannot bear the load that it has to carry.  In particular a nonCatholic viewer without an intuitive sense of the importance of confessional will find it difficult to remember just how impossible it is for Father Logan to clear himself.  This could have been established somehow earlier in the film  Hitchcock could be very creative when demonstrating things like this  but as it is it is assumed that we already appreciate its importance.The two leads also are less than ideal in their roles making it harder for the audience to develop the deep identification with them that makes Hitchcock's best movies such exciting experiences.  The everbrooding Clift is very believable as a priest but his acting range is too limited to make us fully appreciate his dilemma nor can he make the romance angle as compelling as it could have been.  Anne Baxter is also too melodramatic as Logan's old friend who wants to clear him.  Baxter is a good actress in the right part  for example her breathlessness is ideal in All About Eve  but her character here really called for something different.Yet there are some strengths to I Confess.  One that stands out is the wonderful blackandwhite photography.  The film was made on location in Quebec and Hitchcock masterfully uses a careful selection of shots throughout the picture that establish Quebec's distinctiveness and its stark beauty.  It is one of Hitchcock's best pieces of location filming rivaling the French Riviera scenery of To Catch a Thief although of course with a much different tone.  In both films the location nicely complements the story.Karl Malden is good as the inspector assigned to the case.  Malden must accept the usual role of a Hitchcock policeman  hardworking honest and earnest but not very perceptive.  Malden makes what could have been a bland character come to life.There is also a fine climactic sequence Father Logan is finally put on trial and the verdict sparks public outrage and a carefully filmed and suspenseful chain of events.  The climax is perhaps less satisfying than those of Hitchcock's best films but that is mainly because we never learned to identify very much with the characters it is not a fault of the ending itself.  There are some fine Hitchcock touches here that you have to catch on repeat viewings.".

It has some basic weaknesses but also some major strengths that make it worthwhile.  The basic story is established early Catholic priest Father Logan Montgomery Clift hears a confession from the church caretaker who has just killed a man.  Circumstantial evidence leads to Father Logan himself being suspected but he is bound by the seal of the confessional and is unable to clear himself putting him in serious danger of being wrongly convicted.Two basic weaknesses keep I Confess from being one of Hitchcock's better works.

	schema:reviewBody "I Confess is one of the less seen Alfred Hitchcock films that deserve much more attention. It remotely based on a French Stage Play of the beginning of the 20th century by Paul Anthelme called Nos Deux Consciences. It was a film Hitchcock wanted to make for a about a 20 years but kept postponing it realizing difficulty of acceptance it would have in the society because of the subject the film is about.   Father Michael Logan is a young priest in the late 1940s Quebec who hears a confession from Otto Keller Otto Hasse a poor German refugee who works as a caretaker at Father Logan's church who tells him that he has just committed a murder of a lawyer by the name Vilette in whose home he broke in with the intent to rob a big sum of money that would improve his and most importantly his wife Alma's life whom he can't stand seeing working hard anymore.    Soon the body of the victim is found and Inspector Larrue Karl Malden begins to conduct an investigation. He finds witnesses who had seen a priest going out of Vilette's home around the time he was killed. The suspicion falls on Father Logan when discovered that he knew Vilette personally and had a strong personal motive to kill him. In addition to that Otto starts to testify against him also. Now Logan has to make a choice of remaining silent and probably being hanged for a crime he didn't committed or break the secrecy of confession and tell the truth about who the real murderer is.   An intelligent neatly constructed in the best Hitchcock's trademark style film definitely deserves to be seen. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching any Alfred Hitchcock film can be enjoyable when you know something about the director going in. That he got his start as an expressionist filmmaker that he was a Catholic and that he had a deep suspicion of law are all points thrashed out enjoyably in I Confess. It's when you try to watch it as a movie that it feels unsatisfactory.Late one night Father Logan Montgomery Clift sees someone enter his church. It's Keller O.E. Hasse an attendant at Logan's rectory. Keller tells Logan he has a confession to make He just murdered a man. Logan is now bound by the seal of the confessional from telling what he knows a tough thing as suspicions begin to center around Logan himself.From the opening shot of a church spire set high atop the city of Quebec the film makes clear this is going to be a dark and psychological treatment of the sort Hitchcock did in the 1920s with The Lodger and Blackmail. The Catholic angle is presented sincerely if a bit grimly making clear the depth of Logan's dilemma. And the authorities are even more overbearing here than usual pressing not only Logan but his former lover Ruth Anne Baxter with cold certainty and some shady tactics.If only the film worked better as a mystery. The film hinges on a pretty goofy coincidence that the victim of Keller's murder just happened to be blackmailing Ruth about her relationship with Logan. With the notable exception of Karl Malden as a police investigator the cast seems to be sleepwalking through the film Clift so woodenly you might call him the Manchurian Prelate. Hearing Keller's confession he seems almost catatonic and you get as tired as Malden's character listening to his polite evasions. There is nothing I can add to what I've already said he basically says and seems a bit miffed that it's not enough.The confession is the heart of the film and at the heart of the film's problem. Like JoeytheBrit and other posters here I'm struck by the turn in Keller's character from genuinely remorseful to taunting and even conniving to set Logan up. If he's so depraved why did he confess in the first place? Understanding Logan's position he can't rat out Keller no matter how he deserves it because he is now the keeper of Keller's soul it seems he's still too passive not giving Keller any grief when it becomes clear Keller is not turning himself in.It's not a bad film just convoluted and underdeveloped. The exploration of Hitchcock's faith is fascinating stuff and skillfully presented in an expressionistic way plenty of shots where crucifixes are seen in shadow reflection and profile. The encounters between Keller and Logan in the rectory have a certain power even when because? Clift is not projecting very much as if presenting a kind of Christian existentialist message of a lost shepherd left undeveloped in the script. Cinematographer Robert Burks' work on other Hitchcock films is easier to appreciate but his contribution relative to everyone else may not have been greater than it was here.A good film to see with this one is Hitchcock's The Wrong Man which showcases Catholic guilt in a different but no less complicated light. Both are darker films but speak to qualities that undergirded Hitchcock's artistic vision and in more measured doses lifted his work above that of anyone else.".

	schema:reviewBody "To what extent will a priest go to protect a man that has told him during confession about a heinous crime he has committed? That is the moral issue in this 1953 picture. The sanctity of the confessional is put to a test in this account of how an honest priest has to pretend he doesn't know anything about the murder of an unscrupulous man when in reality he knows who the real culprit is. Circumstantial evidence piles up against father Michael Logan who happens to be in a reflective mood on the night the church sexton Mr. Keller a German refugee arrives in a state of panic. Keller wants father Logan to hear his confession in which he discloses his guilt in having murdered the man that used to employ him as a gardener in order to steal a sum of money that he thinks will help his economic situation.The following morning we watch as Father Logan goes to the house of the murder victim where the police are investigating. Of course we are taken by surprise knowing he knew before hand what had happened. He has come for another reason which will be revealed later on. Through a window Inspector Larrue witness how Logan meets a woman a Mrs. Ruth Grandfort and both walk away from crowd that has gathered outside. As it turns out Logan and the woman have known each other intimately before he became a priest. In flashbacks we are told their story of a love gone sour because Ruth didn't wait for Michael's return from the war. The murdered man turns out to have been blackmailing Mrs. Grandfort so the dynamics of the situation changes everything for the former lovers that have not done anything wrong. Alfred Hitchcock directed this seldom seen movie that is based on a stage play probably more of a courtroom drama although in the adaptation the trial involving Michael Logan is only an afterthought. The director emphasis is on the crime itself and the investigation that follows. Contrary to other Hitchcock films there is no overwhelming suspense since the viewer gets to know all the details. The screenplay was by George Tabori and William Archibald.Montgomery Clift an otherwise personable actor was not at his best as the priest at the center of the tragedy. He barely register any emotion even in the flashbacks when he was still a civilian. Anne Baxter blond for the occasion fares better because she has a lot to explain about her relationship with the priest even though there was never anything to be ashamed of. Karl Malden has a much interesting part to play and brings his usual righteousness to the policeman in charge of the investigation. Brian Aherne made an impression as the D.A. prosecuting the case. German actor O.E. Hasse does a wonderful job with Keller.Hitchcock got an amazing work from his cinematographer Robert Burks with his black and white photography of the Quebec City of those years. The music score was by Dmitri Tiomkin. Although not one of Hitchcock's more memorable American films it merits a viewing by fans of the director. The new DVD is excellent.".

You just can't hate it. I would recommend people just to watch the entire 105 minutes movie for the 15 climax alone. It's thrilling emotional and well animated.

	schema:reviewBody "The old widower Antonio enjoys dabbling with the vast family heritage but the actual heir is his daughter Rosa. And once married she will get control over all the riches. To ensure that this will never happen Antonio had pressed the decennial Rosa to take a vow of chastity. Now twenty years later Rosa has remained true to her vow but the temptations all around her just get to be too much for her. Antonio realizes he has to act fast to secure his position and therefore stages a pagan festival where his lustful friends shall dispose of Rosa's desires once and for all Many of director Salvatore Sampieri's works deal with impossible sexual or romantic fulfillment. And he is known for his biting satiric stance on bourgeoisie oldschool social conventions and similar classconceit. All these ingredients are present in Casta e pura but it is just played out too simply. There is a bunch of random buffoons hanging around Antonio's villa all deranged incestuous greedy and whatnot. Antonio is of course the worst kidding his daughter for twenty years always pretending the vow is for her own good. The contrast to the only unspoilt person Rosa comes out way too extreme to take any of these characters seriously  in the end the satiric elements serve for cheap jokes only. Speaking of Rosa she is truly chaste and pure but the general setup feels very farfetched and the situations the screenplay puts her in are just repetitive be it the confessions the lame gags with her dropping dishes or not less than three nightly gatherings with the greedy cook. You can understand Rosa's misery and bitter situation but the character remains shallow. Laura Antonelli's very own Mio Dio come sono caduta in basso 1974 showed perfectly how to build up a story on a similarly awkward premise and managed to be funny throughout. Casta e pura unfortunately fails.The big turning point the weird pagan party is quite a disappointment as well. Resembling the Roman rape of the Sabine Women the editing is very choppy in two occasions we see Rosa nude but after a cut she is dressed again plus rough music jumps. Of course the cruelty of the father and his friends is now pushed to the top. Now we suddenly get a rapeandrevenge situation with a very serious rape and a slapstick revenge afterwards. At this point the screenplay collapses completely and the whole payback stuff is just contrived. Rosa is suddenly like newborn stone cold and will give everybody the just desserts. I was glad when it was over.Laura Antonelli while being absolutely wonderful to behold sometimes even in the nude is a little too old for the role she was 39 by then and I must say her performance leaves something to be desired. However in view of the simple screenplay and the lack of any other remarkable actor it is okay. The rural Italian dialect by some of the characters is very hard to understand so I can't rule out I missed some hidden gags.Overall there is some general quality to Casta e pura one you can expect from a renowned director like Sampieri but the movie never gets momentum owing to a lackluster screenplay and overly simple characterizations.".

	schema:headline " Jules et Jim embodies the beauty of French cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "The French have a remarkable tendency of creating freeflowing poetic movies that transport this particular art form into subtle poignant flights of fancy and nowhere is this more evident than in Jules et Jim which embodies the beauty of French cinema.I believe that Truffaut is the most poetic filmmaker in cinematic history. Jules et Jim is his finest moment and in the ever fluctuating relationships between the Oskar Werner Henri Serre and Jeanne Moreau characters we are allowed to be taken along on a refreshing beatific ride through the passionate simplicity of love and friendship.The leisurely philosophical musings of the two men in Jules et Jim are counterbalanced by Moreau's bright airy amorality. She brings about a radicalism and sense of unpredictability in the movie that is nonetheless charming and utterly innocent and benign. Moreau's instinctive will makes her out to be a selfish attentionseeker but without that this movie would not be so surprising and liberating. Truffaut's does not stick to a rigid narrative form like many '50s and '60s French New Wave directors and he allows the stream of consciousness dialogue and the everchanging fortunes of Moreau's erratic relationships with the men to dictate the structure. Jules et Jim has a certain clarity of vision.French love stories are often based upon dialogue that is rife with throwaway witticisms perceptive trivial observations and explosive utterances of love or despair and Jules et Jim is no different. It can drift along tranquilly until a sudden unexpected change of mood occurs and everything is turned on its head. Moreau's leaping into the river after a civilised night out at the theatre is a delightfully liberating moment utterly pointless yet still gleefully uninhibited. My finest memory is the heavenly ditty by Moreau which sums up both her and the movie's personality and atmosphere. So simple so sublime and always tugging away in the most sumptuous manner at the heartstrings. I don't think I have ever got that tune out of my head.If you want to experience the sheer majesty of cinema Jules et Jim just has to be seen. Not only is it bright and breezy but it has tragic moments of pathos as well. There is a surprise at every turn almost always caused by the Moreau character and such is the freedom of her spirit and the freedom of the movie's spirit you can forgive her every action and fickle aboutturns. There is no sense of permanence with her. Jules et Jim only confirms my belief that the French make cinema's greatest romances. Utterly natural hardly ever contrived and so cool and graceful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Truffaut is one of my favourite directors and Jules et Jim one of my favourite films. As Jeanne Moreau recalls in an interview re her relationship with Truffaut at the time they were briefly in love this was a movie no one wanted to finance that she had to help finance herself with money she had just scored from her latest film success even her car was used to carry sets and other filming equipment and which depended to a large extent on conditions on the ground and inspiration on the part of all especially Truffaut at any given time.Thus creation happened as inspiration came to Truffaut Moreau and the crew and as Moreau remarks the whole movie feels and flows like a song she does sing the theme song rather well at that too!. Jules and Jim are star crossed friends. They have similar tastes and are ready to do anything for each other but being German and French they end up on different trenches in the war. They have imagined and then seen the bust of the ideal feminine beauty and and proceed to look for her in every nook and cranny ultimately finding her in the shape of Moreau at a function.Moreau is luminous in her role as Catherine that would have earned her permanent recognition if she had done nothing else. She is not just beautiful or alluring  she is Woman itself in all its complexities falling in and out of love holding on or letting go as is her wanton. There is a moment in the film when she does not get the attention of the two men because they are playing a game and immediately she demands attention and does not stop until she gets it.Truffaut said on more than one occasion that his relationship with his mother a rather distant one reportedly had had an impact on his relationship with other women but in Jules et Jim he is able to portray the female of the species with a depth and an understanding such as I had never witnessed before or have since.Truffaut's direction is peerless in its acuity and sensitivity and it is greatly aided by some of the loveliest photography ever. In addition he extracts superlative performances from all three leads. Oskar Werner's performance is deft beyond words. Henri Serre reminds me of Daniel DayLewis with a steely performance to match.As art lovers they fall in love with a bust of a woman and look for her until they find Catherine. Is this Catherine an echo of Cathy in Wuthering Heights? Serre might be the Heathcliff while Werner sounds more like an undecided Hamlet knowing he cannot hang on to his Ophelia. The passions at work in the film more than match that of the Bronte novel's characters and of course that of the lukewarm Dane.As lovers of the flesh Jim has a child by Catherine and Jules her love  but it carries a price. The ending is a subtle mix of irony sadness insightful observation and even a touch of the clownish with an unsuitably dressed Jim walking away with the ashes of his beloved lover and friend... much as Hamlet might have walked away with a skull or two.There is a lyrical quality to this film that I believe has never been surpassed. Judging from Woody Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona  which borrows shamelessly from the ideas of Jules et Jim  it will take real genius and a many months of sustained inspiration to surpass it. Given the current never ending supply of mass produced flicks I doubt it will ever be matched let alone surpassed...Jules et Jim is a most intelligent film and a privilege to watch. If it were down to me it would score 11 out of 10.".

As Jeanne Moreau recalls in an interview re her relationship with Truffaut at the time they were briefly in love this was a movie no one wanted to finance that she had to help finance herself with money she had just scored from her latest film success even her car was used to carry sets and other filming equipment and which depended to a large extent on conditions on the ground and inspiration on the part of all especially Truffaut at any given time.Thus creation happened as inspiration came to Truffaut Moreau and the crew and as Moreau remarks the whole movie feels and flows like a song she does sing the theme song rather well at that too!. Jules and Jim are star crossed friends. They have similar tastes and are ready to do anything for each other but being German and French they end up on different trenches in the war.

So I would never say that about a wellrespected film like Jules and Jim. But quite honestly I can't warm up to it. I've watched it on more than one occasion over the years and it never fails to put me to sleep at both ends of my anatomy. I've just viewed a DVD edition in which a film scholar clearly explains his views on the fascination of Jules and Jim. But I still couldn't see why the relationship of these three tedious characters discussed and analyzed in all its very tedious minutiae by those same characters and an offscreen narrator also tedious should interest me. It's certainly beloved by academic types maybe for those very same characteristics? and film critics eat it up like it has gravy on it. Like another commentator I'm a bit puzzled by all the comments about its lyrical lighthearted and idyllic qualities. I'm left with the impression of a rather dry academic dissertation on the complexities of malefemale relationships ca. 1961 the 1910 setting seems to me immaterial to the script.I can't help feeling that I'm missing something and I'm not averse to French films but they're usually older prenewwave films for example Forbidden Games French CanCan or Pagnol's Fanny trilogy. I take it that the sentimentality of such films is one of the things new wave directors reacted against. If so I can't jump on their bandwagon try as I might. I've enjoyed some of Truffaut's work but not this I'm afraid.To those who love and appreciate Jules and Jim  have pleasure of it. I envy you for that and maybe I'll try it again in a few years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although Jules and Jim was made over 40 years ago and takes place 40 to 50 years before that the amazing thing is that it barely seems to have dated. Because it focuses on the universal human relationships between its characters rather than the specific time in which they live it's the rare film set in the past that doesn't feel like a period film. And especially in the first half of the movie Truffaut's New Wave techniques lend a remarkable energy and freshness.The movie explores friendship and love among three semibohemian types Parisian Jim Henri Serre Austrian Jules Oskar Werner and Catherine Jeanne Moreau the beautiful freespirited woman whom they both love. She's the most vibrant character in the movie and impossible to pin down. It's never clear who she lovesshe contradicts herself repeatedly and perhaps loves no one but herselfor whether she's diabolical or simply misunderstood. Moreau nearly steals the movie if not for the fact that the title reminds us to focus on the relationship between the two men and that Serre and Werner give good performances too. Even if Jim and Jules aren't as mysterious as Catherine they're complex and interesting characters in their own right.The story plays out rather episodically which means Jules and Jim is full of wonderful little moments often involving the crazy things Catherine does. Some of my favorites include her dressing up as a man and racing Jules and Jim across a bridge her jumping into the Seine in frustration and her singing the movie's charming theme song The Whirlpool of Life. The episodes are linked together by surprisingly unobtrusive offscreen narration which keeps the film moving along rather than slowing it down.Jules and Jim does get a little tiresome toward the end with Catherine continually vacillating between the men in her life Jim vacillating between Catherine and his old girlfriend Gilberte and Jules remaining loyally devoted to Catherine despite how foolish this may seem. However the movie is redeemed by its tragic final scenes which poignantly contrast with the carefree gaiety of the beginning. Jules Jim and Catherine are caught in a destructive spiral tossed and defeated by the whirlpool of life. Still the tone of the movie is gentle and human not pessimistic. Truffaut considered Jules and Jim a hymn to life and it is most memorable as a vivid celebration of friendship and youthful possibility even as it acknowledges how those things can sour.".

	schema:reviewBody "JULES AND JIM is a romantic drama about a transience love friendship patience and perversions.A bit shy writer from Austria forges a friendship with an extroverted Frenchman. They share an interest in the world of the arts and the Bohemian lifestyle. Once they meet a freespirited and capricious girl who has reminded them on a serene smile of an ancient statue of a goddess. The three hang out together. The two friends fall in love with her and her attitudes toward life. She gets a few days before the Great War married to a young writer from Austria. Both men serve during the war on opposing sides. After the war the Frenchman visit his friends who now have a daughter in their home. Their marriage is in crisis...Mr. Truffaut has presented a complex and enigmatic love triangle in a rather confusing way. A tendency toward unusual ideals and the perfect woman through a free love making ends tragically. Here we need to distinguish between a rebellious nature of one of the protagonists and ideals of free love.

	onyx:emotionText "JULES AND JIM is a romantic drama about a transience love friendship patience and perversions.A bit shy writer from Austria forges a friendship with an extroverted Frenchman. They share an interest in the world of the arts and the Bohemian lifestyle. Once they meet a freespirited and capricious girl who has reminded them on a serene smile of an ancient statue of a goddess. The three hang out together. The two friends fall in love with her and her attitudes toward life. She gets a few days before the Great War married to a young writer from Austria. Both men serve during the war on opposing sides. After the war the Frenchman visit his friends who now have a daughter in their home. Their marriage is in crisis...Mr. Truffaut has presented a complex and enigmatic love triangle in a rather confusing way. A tendency toward unusual ideals and the perfect woman through a free love making ends tragically. Here we need to distinguish between a rebellious nature of one of the protagonists and ideals of free love. This film becomes a charming and exciting through a subjective view of love and friendship.An authentic scenery is pretty amazing. Characterization is great because among other things it is difficult to draw the line between positive and negative character.Jeanne Moreau as Catherine is a beautiful attractive intelligent and seductive woman.

	schema:reviewBody "The enduring legacy around Franois Truffaut's emotionally turbulent 1962 film depends primarily on how compatible the three actors are in inhabiting the triangle at the core of the story adapted from HenriPierre Roch semiautobiographical novel. And in fact Oskar Werner Henri Serre and especially Jeanne Moreau provide superbly etched characterizations in one of the defining works of the French New Wave. Fortunately the twodisc Criterion Collection DVD set provides an appropriately rich package for this classic although the print transfer is frustratingly variable at times.The story focuses on the friendship between two writers an Austrian named Jules and a Frenchman named Jim kindred spirits who enjoy a decadent lifestyle in preWWI Paris. Inspired by a statue of a woman's face with a most enigmatic smile they agree that they are destined to fall in love with a woman with the same smile. Enter Catherine as seductively capricious a freespirit as ever there was in cinema and the two men are instantly enamored. Jules is intent on marrying her even though it's clear from the outset that she is not one who could commit for the long term. The war intercedes and the two friends are fighting on opposite sides. After the war Catherine married to Jules and raising their young daughter is emotionally dissatisfied and embarks on an affair with Jim. With Jules' blessing things are idyllic for a while but Jim proves too much the alpha male to defer to Catherine's whims and the resulting imbalance leads to increasingly dramatic consequences.In just his third film Truffaut's trademark style emerges with fast cuts between scenes and naturalistic camera movements courtesy of Raoul Coutard's fluid cinematography. Moreover George Delerue's animated music score and Michel Subor's voiceover add to the evocative photoalbum memory atmosphere. At times the storyline feels a bit disjointed but the fulsome performances more than compensate. Werner fully captures the internal struggle within Jules in attempting to reconcile his love for Catherine with her impossible demands on him. Serre has the comparatively more objective role but convincingly shows his character surrendering to the tangled situation. After her impressive turn as an obsessed adulterer in Louie Malle's Elevator to the Gallows Moreau solidifies her vaunted reputation here conveying Catherine's petulance and unyielding passion in a vividly mercurial fashion.The DVD extras are abundant starting with two commentary tracks. The first one a more factual account of the production was recorded in 1992 with Truffaut collaborator Suzanne Schiffman editor Claudine Bouche coscreenwriter Jean Gruault and scholar Annette Insdorf. The second produced in 2000 is far better as it has Moreau sharing her personal recollections of the filming with Truffaut biographer Serge Toubiana. Disc One also includes a brief 1966 interview with Truffaut discussing Roch and a 1985 featurette The Key to Jules and Jim which contains interviews with the author's friends as they discuss the inspirations for the characters. Disc Two takes a broader look at Truffaut with five separate interviews with the director over the span of fifteen years as well as insightful interviews with Coutard and coscreenwriter Jean Gruault.".

	schema:reviewBody "A better title would have been The Two Suckers.The movie starts off with a oneminute summaryprologue of some events that transpired between and around JJ. It went by so quickly that I could barely catch anything except that Jules failed humping a number of women whereas Jim had them all the French narrator pretty much being hellbent on setting a new worldrecord in speedjabbering. Well that must have been the movie then! I thought for there was enough plot in that speedy recount of events for an entire prequel to JJ. I guess that prequel would have been called Jim  Jules Their Happy Life Before Katherine.We find out that JJ are poets writers artists... Oh no! Not another pretentious Eurotrash saga about the sensitive souls that inhabit Paris while discussing the meaning of life! But no fear. While the movie IS pretentious though it's not about the meaning of life but about the meaning and intentions of a particularly emptyheaded French bimbo by the name of Katherine. After all this is a French movie.Before meeting this apparition as Jim so pretentiously calls her JJ see a woman's mysteriously smiling face carved out of a rock. JJ both dressed the same way to see this work of art we are told by the narrator by not WHY they dressed the same way. And what happens if I dare ask why? I will be called an uncouth philistine who doesn't appreciate the depth that this movie has to offer. Nevertheless I still ask why. If anyone out there can tell me feel free to email me. I look forward to reading your silly hallucinatory psychobabble.Anyway predictably they meet a woman who fits the rock's smile and it's of course Jeanna Moreau whose beauty is vastly overrated. Katherine wants to set a bunch of papers letters? on fire which she refers to as lies how poetic! and in the process she nearly burns herself and her house down. Conclusion? Katherine is a moron. JJ have just fallen in love with a dumb floozy. That's what happens when penises do the thinking nothing new there.After watching a play JJ disagree with Katherine on whether it was good or not. Realizing that JJ are far superior to her intellectually  i.e. she ran out of arguments  she spontaneously decides to jump into the river. The narrator calls it her victory. So all you women out there if you ever find yourself outargued jump into the nearest batch of water. That'll show 'em! WW I breaks out. Symbolically JJ get split up to fight on opposing sides. The thing that made me smile was that both of them expressed fear of killing the other in battle. Are artists that dumb? What are the odds that they kill each other in a war in which millions upon millions of soldiers participate? Still this part of the movie was not bad at all but this was probably due to the stockfootage of trenches and battlefields. I.e. these scenes were NOT directed by Truffaut so there was nothing much to criticize.The war was over Jim's side won. It turns out Jules has a child with Katherine which is probably not even his a woman who is not only dumb but also turns out to be a slut having cheated on her husband numerous times. Jim sees his chance! Btw there is a silly scene in which Katherine lists various wines and this moment reminded me of Monty Python's cheese sketch. Nevertheless the movie was improving at this point somewhat.Eventually Jim hooks up with Katherine they're together they split they hook up they split they hook up they split up  and then Katherine drives them both off a bridge leaving Jules as the sole survivor of this French game of who's the ass?. The moment I saw her driving the car I knew she was going to do that.I love the way Truffaut through his alter Ego Jules makes up excuses for Katherine's behaviour.

Similarly the quasi minihippie commune that the two morons the harlot and the child briefly form is supposed to be exalted ohso progressive advanced. But what's one to expect from a decadent leftwing European director? I was also fascinated by Katherine's penishopping. At one point she had dinner with three of the men she was involved with. There are pro prostitutes that can't achieve a feat like that... Truffaut tries to inject a philosophical slant to the whoring around but no words no matter how cleverly articulated can mask the truth namely that Katherine just gets bored with one penis far too easily then jumps on to the next. Just another floozy what's there to discuss? I found the narration to be too robotic matteroffact. The narrator talked about all these complex emotional happenings but he recited them with the passioninterest of a schoolkid forced to recite a poem. In fact they might as well have used Stephen Hawking's voicebox... Plus some of the things said in the narration were superfluous e.g. when Katherine walks Jim to the station in an obvious fog it is then that the disinterested narrator informs us that a fog has fallen. No kidding??Oh yes and the movie is about destiny for example Jim missing Katherine by only ten minutes in the bar an event that could have changed everything... and... oh whatever...".

	onyx:emotionText "A better title would have been The Two Suckers.The movie starts off with a oneminute summaryprologue of some events that transpired between and around JJ. It went by so quickly that I could barely catch anything except that Jules failed humping a number of women whereas Jim had them all the French narrator pretty much being hellbent on setting a new worldrecord in speedjabbering. Well that must have been the movie then! I thought for there was enough plot in that speedy recount of events for an entire prequel to JJ. I guess that prequel would have been called Jim  Jules Their Happy Life Before Katherine.We find out that JJ are poets writers artists... Oh no! Not another pretentious Eurotrash saga about the sensitive souls that inhabit Paris while discussing the meaning of life! But no fear. While the movie IS pretentious though it's not about the meaning of life but about the meaning and intentions of a particularly emptyheaded French bimbo by the name of Katherine. After all this is a French movie.Before meeting this apparition as Jim so pretentiously calls her JJ see a woman's mysteriously smiling face carved out of a rock. JJ both dressed the same way to see this work of art we are told by the narrator by not WHY they dressed the same way. And what happens if I dare ask why? I will be called an uncouth philistine who doesn't appreciate the depth that this movie has to offer. Nevertheless I still ask why. If anyone out there can tell me feel free to email me. I look forward to reading your silly hallucinatory psychobabble.Anyway predictably they meet a woman who fits the rock's smile and it's of course Jeanna Moreau whose beauty is vastly overrated. Katherine wants to set a bunch of papers letters? on fire which she refers to as lies how poetic! and in the process she nearly burns herself and her house down. Conclusion? Katherine is a moron. JJ have just fallen in love with a dumb floozy. That's what happens when penises do the thinking nothing new there.After watching a play JJ disagree with Katherine on whether it was good or not. Realizing that JJ are far superior to her intellectually  i.e. she ran out of arguments  she spontaneously decides to jump into the river. The narrator calls it her victory. So all you women out there if you ever find yourself outargued jump into the nearest batch of water. That'll show 'em! WW I breaks out. Symbolically JJ get split up to fight on opposing sides. The thing that made me smile was that both of them expressed fear of killing the other in battle. Are artists that dumb? What are the odds that they kill each other in a war in which millions upon millions of soldiers participate? Still this part of the movie was not bad at all but this was probably due to the stockfootage of trenches and battlefields. I.e. these scenes were NOT directed by Truffaut so there was nothing much to criticize.The war was over Jim's side won. It turns out Jules has a child with Katherine which is probably not even his a woman who is not only dumb but also turns out to be a slut having cheated on her husband numerous times. Jim sees his chance! Btw there is a silly scene in which Katherine lists various wines and this moment reminded me of Monty Python's cheese sketch. Nevertheless the movie was improving at this point somewhat.Eventually Jim hooks up with Katherine they're together they split they hook up they split they hook up they split up  and then Katherine drives them both off a bridge leaving Jules as the sole survivor of this French game of who's the ass?. The moment I saw her driving the car I knew she was going to do that.I love the way Truffaut through his alter Ego Jules makes up excuses for Katherine's behaviour. When she's unfaithful she is exploring the boundaries of experience or some such poetic malarkey.

	schema:reviewBody "Jules and Jim Although lumped in with the New Wave group of films The 400 Blows Breathless et al of the early 1960s Jules and Jim shares few of their characteristics. Franois Truffautconsidered the grandfather of the French cinema movement la nouvelle vagueonce again looks to his childhood. But the result is less nostalgic and much more lyrical and moody than 400 Blows about a naughty Parisian school boy and the system that represses his childish impulses.The film is set in bohemian France just before the breakout of the Great War. Two men meet by accident and become best friends. As the title of the movie suggests Jules a sandyhaired German and Jim a darkhaired Frenchman are inseparable they box each other  la franaise and go to cramped corner cafs the likes of which are soughtafter in Paris. For students of French literature the plot resembles the story of Pierre et Jean the two brothers of a petite bourgeoise family who get into trouble when a woman enters their lives. Enter Catherine once again by accident. She runs into the two as they walk down a street late one night. Jules becomes infatuated with her almost at once. He loves in particular her calm visage which reminds him of an ancient stone sculpture he found on an island excursion with Jim after seeing a slideshow.Catherine it turns out is more of an adventurous bohemian than Jules or Jim. In one lovely scene the trio arrive at the end of an overpass. Catherine challenges them to a race dressed as a boy and takes off before Jim has given the commands. The course  pied evokes not so much frivolity but a certain carefree bohemian demeanor that soon thereafter went into hibernation in capitals across Europe. The expansive camera work does not seem cramped despite the claustrophobic space and demonstrates the skill even ingenuity of New Wave directors such as Truffaut. But Catherine tires of Paris and desires to take an overnight trip to Provence.To achieve historic authenticity whatever that may be Truffaut employed stock footage of Paris from that period. Although grainy though much cleaned up and improved by the Criterion remastering the clips do almost serve as sketches of inspiration for Truffaut. Moreover one can almost perceive Truffaut shaking his head over the Dark Ages of filmmaking. But they do provide context at the expense of seeming somewhat out of place and jarring.Other elements work more cohesively. The soundper the New Wave standard of excellenceis firstrate. The fanfare is sweeping and doesn't upstage either the acting or camera work.But Catherine is the more complicated and troubled of the characters. One night out reminiscent of their first meeting Jules goes off and quotes an uncouth Baudelaire verse which upsets Catherine. Distraught and hopeless she tosses herself into the Seine. Her fedora floats away but Jules and Jim manage to pull her from the water. Death is a constant specter in this film and her attempt if not attentiongetting act marks an evolution in the mood of the film.Jules and Jim spend much of the time in the film together but when the First World War breaks out they become soldiers in opposing armies. Jules writes a letter to Catherine who has since become his wife that he worries constantly that he will kill his friend Jim. This sentiment only underscores the psychological trauma of the lost generation. He writes more letters home. Eventually Jules is positioned on the Eastern Front where the fighting is worse and the weather colder but he finds new hope in knowing that he won't inadvertently shoot Jim. Truffaut dabbles in the stock footage again here. This time it is excellentand serves a useful purpose i.e. keeping the film budget low by eliminating battle scenes. The shots are gritty and more importantly nonfictive.The war ends and both Jules and Jim count themselves among the survivors. Jules survived the war but he isn't the same. He has relocated the family to the bucolic foothills of Austria. No longer youthful and energetic he has discovered a new passion tending his garden. When Jim visits the two seem older more rooted. Catherine is in the inscrutable words of Jim less grasshopper more ant. She makes less music and she works more to keep the household intact and functioning. Jules and Catherine have had a baby a stark change from their prewar days. Their daughter is a larger theme she is joy and hope for the future but also a tiedown who is conspicuously absent in the last act.Though it is called Jules and Jim the film is really about the whims and emotional states of its heroine Catherine. Catherine feels isolated living in Germany. She longs for a different lifeher former one in France. She is not entirely domesticated but she has clearly lost some of her youthful air. She is married to Jules but toward the end she professes her love for Jim. This mnange  trois is a central element of the film. Only when the three are united does some sort harmony and balance dominate. But Catherine is the pivot of this trio and its soul.My only gripe with the film is its length. It could be ten maybe fifteen minutes slimmer. But when a gifted director like Truffaut is telling the story perhaps too long is never enough.".

I loved the blending of historical film into the narrative I don't know if he was the first person to do this  I highly doubt it  but he certainly did it well in this picture. Jules et Jim is a study of capriciousness.  Catherine  a woman to whom monogamy seems like a foreign concept  is to paraphrase the film not particularly intelligent beautiful or kind but she's treated like a queen.'  Why Jules and Jim love her so I don't know.  They seem like strong enough characters to be without such a difficult woman but I guess that question is at the center of the film.  For some reason Jules et Jim reminded me of L'Avventura by Antonioni  maybe because it was also a hard movie to enter and because the characters were so inaccessible.  There are certainly elements of the neorealism in this film one need look no further than the extensive use of mist and the forest scenes that closely resemble the dream sequences of Fellini De Sica et. al. Overall I would say this picture is worthwhile although there are certainly better more accessible and mature Truffaut films out there.".

	schema:headline " Among the last of the thinking man's epics and one of the best.";
	schema:reviewBody "At the time of it's release in December of 1971 Nicholas and Alexandra must have seemed like an anachronistic piece of filmmaking especially when compared with fellow Best Picture Nominees A Clockwork Orange The French Connection and The Last Picture Show. Based on a bestselling work of popular history it was film making on a grand scale boasting for it's cast a veritable who's who of the English speaking stage a sweeping love story spanning many years thrown over thousands of miles using the conflict of World War I and the Russian Revolution as it's background. It must have seemed to many like the best film David Lean never made. And superficially it does resemble Lean's epic of a few years earlier Doctor Zhivago. Indeed three of Lean's close associates Producer Sam Spiegel Production Designer John Box and Cinematographer Freddie Young all shine in this production. Unfortunately having arrived late in the historical epic film cycle it was largely dismissed at the time of it's release by critics but time has revealed it's many virtues. Produced with lavish care and attention to detail by Sam Spiegel for Horizon Pictures Nicholas and Alexandra is among the last of the great thinking man's epics and one of the best. This is due in no small measure to the wonderful screenplay by James Goldman. Goldman who also scripted The Lion in Winter and Robin and Marian had a fine ear for dialogue and Nicholas and Alexandra is a pleasure to listen to as well as to behold. Like Robert Bolt's Lawrence of Arabia Charles Wood's Charge of the Light Brigade and Robert Ardrey's Khartoum all fine historical epics Goldman's Nicholas and Alexandra is elevated by an intelligent script laced with fine dialogue. Transposing history onto the screen is never an easy task but the story of the last years of the Romanov Dynasty is well served by Goldman. He skillfully telescopes events while still remaining basically true to historic fact. One way or another all films dealing with history compromise fact for drama. The best of them achieve a balance between the two. Those pedants who quibble over this fact of life please refer to the historical plays of Shakespeare for it's validation.Among the film's many pleasures is the high level of acting by an impressive cast. Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman are simply magnificent in the lead roles. It was an uncanny and bold choice using two unknowns to star in a film of this scope and they have no problems carrying the three hour film. Both create complex threedimensional characters deeply flawed yet appealing sympathetic and infuriating. it is the film's unwillingness to portray them as simply victims that gives it tragic grandeur. A special note must be made of Tom Baker's performance as Rasputin. Too often in previous movies filmmakers have exploited the sensational events of the man's life and nothing more. This film actually had the courage to downplay those lurid elements striving instead for complexity of character. Here we have a tortured individual a charlatan and a monk lascivious yet craving spiritual redemption. The Imperial Children are also sensitively depicted with a standout performance by Roderic Noble as the hemophiliac only son Alexis. The internal angst he brings to the part in his later scenes is impressive. Franklin J. Schaffner's able direction keeps the film moving along and at no time is there any danger of the film losing focus on the two leads. This was no mean feat considering the powerhouse supporting cast that included Laurence Olivier Michael Redgrave Harry Andrews Irene Worth Jack Hawkins Ian Holm Michael Bryant Brian Cox Eric Porter Timothy West Peter McEnery Julian Glover Roy Dotrice Maurice Denham Alan Webb Guy Rolfe Steven Berkof and John Wood all of whom do memorable turns.In the first half of the movie the filmmakers vividly bring to life the isolated fairytale world the Imperial Family inhabited. The beautiful palaces and villas provide a striking contrast to the shabby squalid prison quarters of the film's second half which deals largely with the Romanov's exile and imprisonment in Siberia. The murder of the Royal Family in the basement of the Ipatiev house the so called House of Special Purpose is one of the most strikingly directed scenes in the film. The brutal suddenness with which it is depicted packs quite a wallop. Filmed in Panavision the film is gorgeous to look at. John Box's recreation of Imperial Russia at the turn of the century truly deserved it's Academy Award for Best Production Design as did Yvonne Blake for Best Costume Design. Freddie Young's stunning cinematography and Richard Rodney Bennett's haunting music score were also nominated though they both lost to other films. Finally it is a beautifully edited film a marvelous example of invisible editing used to create a subtle but powerful sense of irony. A superb film that deals intelligently with the problems inherent in transposing history onto film.".

You actually believe they ARE the couple.  Michael Jayston is truly remarkable as Nicholas and even resembles him.  The rest of the cast is superb especially Tom Baker's portrayal as Rasputin . . . marvelous!  The movie sticks pretty much to the facts. Keep in mind Nicholas was not a bad man but he didn't want to be Czar. He would have preferred to be a potato farmer.  You feel the fear growing as Nicholas and his family slowly withdraw into their own world because of Alexis' Hemophilia.  Nichola's stand that God meant for me to rule causes him to rarely listen to the good advice of the people around him and not heed the warning that he not go to the front to take charge.  Add to this the rumor of Alexandra being a German spy Rasputin's death by Prince Yusupov and Grand Duke Dimitry the loss of thousands of soldiers the starving Russian people  . . . and Nicholas leaves the door wide open for Lenin and his eventual return to power.  After he abdicates he and his family are shuttled around until they end up in Ekaterinburg and The House of Special Purpose.This is a great movie.  See it if you have a long afternoon with nothing to do you won't regret it.BTW the DVD version adds deleted scenes that sew up some loose ends.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a beautifully filmed epic but let me forewarn you that it's not always accurate but then few are. Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman excel as the doomed Imperial couple whose love for each other and their children is touching but whose incapability to rule their country makes them appear insensitive to their subjects. Tom Baker as the infamous Grigory Rasputin fits the bill for the role and he even manages to insert bits of humor in this much portrayed character. The incomparable Sir Laurence Olivier is impeccable in his turn as Witte. One of the most memorable scenes is the murder of Rasputin again somewhat fictionalized but highly watchable and entertaining. Martin Potter Prince Felix Yussopov is fascinating and repellent while Richard Warwick RIP as Grand Duke Dmitry is boyishly and deliciously captivating. Irene Worth as the Dowager Empress is so natural and the majority of the characters I've noted some exceptions below came off very well. The reconstruction of Bloody Sunday WW1 and the execution were expertly presented.However several scenes some not included in the video release but restored on DVD are fictionalized or downright false. On the DVD for example the part where Grand Duchess Tatiana the late Lynne Fredrick RIP exposes herself to a Bolshevik guard in Ekaterinburg is fabricated and ridiculous. The supposed 'attempted suicide' by Alexei was again misrepresented  the actual incident which occurred at Tobolsk was accidental. Yakovlev Sir Ian Holm is portrayed as a hating nasty man when in actuality he treated the Czar and his family with the utmost respect despite his membership with the Bolsheviks. Jacob Yurovsky Alan Webb is shown to be a kind elderly gentleman which he was most certainly not. The Imperial daughters were not given much to do and their characters were never fully developed. We pretty much had to guess which daughter each actress was portraying until the climax and the actresses did not resemble the real people at all!!! The eldest daughter was too darkhaired thinlipped and sharpfeatured not to say that she was unattractive while the second was the wrong physical type the third again had hair that was too dark wrong body type and was too short. The youngest was too tall and her hair was too light. And those 70s hairstyles! I guess I'm too picky but considering the excellent job of casting with the main characters they were way off here!On the whole worthwhile viewing but I recommend that people read biographies of the Romanovs before seeing the movie and try to get it on DVD if possible. The final scene is hard to watch at least I thought so and on the DVD print watch for 'movie mistakes'!!! But don't miss it. And oh those costumes and locations!An interesting note John Wood who plays Colonel Koblinsky here later played Prime Minister Stolypin in 'Rasputin Dark Servant Of Destiny'.Take your girls  or your boys  frolic in the provinces but get him out of here!".

	schema:headline " Decent But Dense";
	schema:reviewBody "Nicholas And Alexandra covers a lot of the same ground that Dr. Zhivago does and a good deal more. The difference is that Zhivago views the Russian Revolution and its aftermath from the view of several fictional but real composite people author Boris Pasternak knew.Robert K. Massie however was writing history not fiction and his story is intertwined with the personal story of Nicholas Romanov and Alexandra of Hesse who were a rarity among royalty a love match. The only other one like it that comes immediately to mind is that of Charles Stuart and Queen Henrietta Marie of Great Britain. And both monarchs came to the same tragic end.I read the book many years ago 1971 to be precise. It was in the day room of the basic training company I was assigned in that garden spot of the universe Fort Polk Louisiana. For several weeks I went to that room and read about Nicky and Alix and their times. I became the Romanov expert of Fort Polk. Too bad there wasn't a call for my knowledge. Mr. Massie is also one incredibly slow writer in this case I really recommend you see the movie rather than read the book.The story covers the time from the birth of their last child the Tsarevitch Alexis to the deaths of the Romanov family. Perhaps if Nicholas had not been the good and caring father he was dealing with Alexis's hemophilia he might have paid more attention to stirrings in his country and the course of world history might have been different.Nicholas was an autocrat though the last among the major European rulers. Even his cousin the Kaiser had given his country an elected Parliament and was far more advanced industrially. He had what most reckoned was the best army in the world the best trained the most mechanized and a mighty industrial machine. All Russia had was a vast population which took a bad beating in two wars the RussoJapanese War and World War I in Nicholas's time.Nicholas thought as his predecessor Alexander I did that he could outlast the outsiders as his people did under Napoleon's invasion. The problem was that he never grasped that he was not giving his people a reason to fight and Lenin and the Bolsheviks were giving them every reason to quit.Michael Jayston plays the complex role of Czar Nicholas II a man both decent and dense at the same time. Janet Suzman was the Czarina Alexandra a woman who insisted on her royal prerogatives on all occasions. Suzman who was nominated for Best Actress but lost to Jane Fonda for Klute has the most interesting role. Hemophilia is hereditary and while men get it the women are the carriers. Her guilt over that and remember were not just talking an ordinary family but a royal heir caused her to seek out every quack remedy going and ultimately to the influence of the malevolent Rasputin.If Rasputin were alive today he'd be a starting a televangelist movement for the Russian Orthodox Church. To this day no one really knows what powers and abilities he had over the young Tsarevitch and his ability control the bleeding but whatever it was it did work. He gained ascendancy over the Tsarina because of that.Tom Baker best known as the Fourth Doctor Who plays the charismatic and cunning Rasputin. This is probably is best performance outside the Doctor Who series. Why he wasn't given Oscar consideration the Deity only knows.Out of the large supporting cast Laurence Olivier stands out as Count Witte the best of Nicholas's ministers. Witte in his career was responsible for the construction of the TransSiberian Railway and was able to negotiate a peace that involved great saving of face for Russia which was beaten badly in the RussoJapanese War. In the film and in real life Witte was not listened to.Nicholas and Alexandra is both entertaining and historically accurate. Besides Janet Suzman's nomination the film received several other nominations and won for Best ArtSet Decorations and Best Costume Design. Director Franklin J. Schaffner was overlooked for Best Director then again he won the previous year for Patton. Nicholas and Alexandra was also up for Best Picture but lost to The French Connection. I wouldn't miss it if it's broadcast.".

	onyx:emotionText "Nicholas And Alexandra covers a lot of the same ground that Dr. Zhivago does and a good deal more. The difference is that Zhivago views the Russian Revolution and its aftermath from the view of several fictional but real composite people author Boris Pasternak knew.Robert K. Massie however was writing history not fiction and his story is intertwined with the personal story of Nicholas Romanov and Alexandra of Hesse who were a rarity among royalty a love match. The only other one like it that comes immediately to mind is that of Charles Stuart and Queen Henrietta Marie of Great Britain. And both monarchs came to the same tragic end.I read the book many years ago 1971 to be precise. It was in the day room of the basic training company I was assigned in that garden spot of the universe Fort Polk Louisiana. For several weeks I went to that room and read about Nicky and Alix and their times. I became the Romanov expert of Fort Polk. Too bad there wasn't a call for my knowledge. Mr. Massie is also one incredibly slow writer in this case I really recommend you see the movie rather than read the book.The story covers the time from the birth of their last child the Tsarevitch Alexis to the deaths of the Romanov family. Perhaps if Nicholas had not been the good and caring father he was dealing with Alexis's hemophilia he might have paid more attention to stirrings in his country and the course of world history might have been different.Nicholas was an autocrat though the last among the major European rulers. Even his cousin the Kaiser had given his country an elected Parliament and was far more advanced industrially. He had what most reckoned was the best army in the world the best trained the most mechanized and a mighty industrial machine. All Russia had was a vast population which took a bad beating in two wars the RussoJapanese War and World War I in Nicholas's time.Nicholas thought as his predecessor Alexander I did that he could outlast the outsiders as his people did under Napoleon's invasion. The problem was that he never grasped that he was not giving his people a reason to fight and Lenin and the Bolsheviks were giving them every reason to quit.Michael Jayston plays the complex role of Czar Nicholas II a man both decent and dense at the same time. Janet Suzman was the Czarina Alexandra a woman who insisted on her royal prerogatives on all occasions. Suzman who was nominated for Best Actress but lost to Jane Fonda for Klute has the most interesting role. Hemophilia is hereditary and while men get it the women are the carriers. Her guilt over that and remember were not just talking an ordinary family but a royal heir caused her to seek out every quack remedy going and ultimately to the influence of the malevolent Rasputin.If Rasputin were alive today he'd be a starting a televangelist movement for the Russian Orthodox Church. To this day no one really knows what powers and abilities he had over the young Tsarevitch and his ability control the bleeding but whatever it was it did work. He gained ascendancy over the Tsarina because of that.Tom Baker best known as the Fourth Doctor Who plays the charismatic and cunning Rasputin. This is probably is best performance outside the Doctor Who series. Why he wasn't given Oscar consideration the Deity only knows.Out of the large supporting cast Laurence Olivier stands out as Count Witte the best of Nicholas's ministers. Witte in his career was responsible for the construction of the TransSiberian Railway and was able to negotiate a peace that involved great saving of face for Russia which was beaten badly in the RussoJapanese War.

	schema:reviewBody "This truly beautiful movie with considerable artistic value should not be watched for its historical accuracy or its lack of geographical precision. It is mainly a story about a marriage of two weak but lovable people who somehow should not have been where fate put them. You could call Nicholas and Alexandra an antimonarchistic manifesto.The script really is first rate it doesn't matter that all the characters are far more English than Russian what counts is the way a tragic situation unfolds in front of the viewers. For many the last czar probably was a monster as he ordered the death of hundreds of thousands. Yet watching the movie you want to believe that he is the victim of circumstances far removed from everyday life and a husband and father who cares deeply and in spite of all his outrageous decisions and nondecisions wants to be good. Strange as it seems but the intimate scenes between him and his wife are the highlights of the movie as they really bring out the affection between two people who are attracted to each other although they are only too familiar with each other's flaws. It makes the tragic ending of the movie all the more sad.I had the chance to visit Nicholas' palace in Yalta a few years back. It is full of family snapshots as the czar was an avid photographer and also movie maker. It is striking how modern those pictures are how relaxed and middle class the imperial family always in bathing suits or some elegant leisure wear appears. In a strange way the Russian emperor comes through as being much less crusty than his contemporaries on the throne of Britain Germany or AustriaHungary. It gives you the idea that he was a modern man. Strangely whenever he himself is in the photos he is never in the center of the picture but always somewhere in a marginal position seeming to be either bemused or slightly embarrassed. What a sad career! An interesting sideeffect of the movie is the fact that it shows that at the outset of World War I the crowned heads of Europe many of them related to each other and on relatively intimate terms could have prevented the bloodshed. They failed colossally and thus sealed the fate of a continent that still tries to find unity and a common denominator.".

	schema:headline " Dazzling cinema disappointing drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Robert Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra basis of this film appeared to acclaim in 1968. Massie gave the first straightforward look at Nicholas II and Alexandra last sovereigns of Old Russia. Most people knew only outlines of their tragedytheir son was hemophiliac victim of a condition hereditary in Alexandra's family the boy might bleed to death from any injury. His poor health left Alexandra vulnerable to a charlatan Rasputin who gained unchallenged influence over her. Massie put flesh and blood on these bones. But his own son was hemophiliac and his outlook blinkered by personal knowledge of his wife's agony as a mother responsible for her son's sufferings. Inescapably Massie's book is sympathetic to Alexandra and until the 1990s most accounts of the Romanovs echoed him the empress' excesses were excused as those of a distraught mother in the grip of guilt and grief.After 1989 Russian archival material radically changed this picture. Letters and diaries by politicians and the Romanov family prove that Alexandra was strongly disliked and distrusted. Her uninformed political meddling arose from undue confidence in her own limited abilities and was a main factor in the events of 191718. Domestically she was a hypochondriac tyrant emotionally distant from her daughters and smotheringly watchful over Alexei who like his sisters never developed social skills appropriate to his age.Against these revised views on the Tsar and his wife Nicholas and Alexandra seems almost quaint today. It is nonetheless visually glorious cinema sumptuous interiors beautiful uniforms and gowns and staggering wealth displayed in jewels delight the eye and visualize the isolated world these people inhabited. The contrast between imperial wealth and urban poverty is however too sharply drawn. We see how factory workers lived but the film ignores Russia's growing middle class when increasing wealth and education favored a flourishing cultural lifethe works of such men as Tchaikovsky and Gorky. Massie's book dealt with such developments but the film ignores them so viewers' image of late Tsarist Russia is skewed.Dramatically Nicholas and Alexandra is rarely anything but turgid. In only one scene did James Goldman a gifted screenwriter rise to the level he achieved in The Lion in Winterthe dialogue between Nicholas and Alexei after the boy races his sled downstairs into a closed door Goldman sensitively develops their words into a dialogue between the disgraced Tsar and Russia itself. With one brief exceptionsee below the film doesn't sustain that level.We rarely get a satisfying sense of the relationship between Tsar and empress who either express undying love for each other or quarrel over Rasputin and how Nicholas should run his government. One of the clearest glimpses of the relationship comes late in the film as Nicholas argues not with his wife but with his mother over Alexandra's influence. The film more successfully maps Alexandra's relationship with Rasputin as witness the first scene between them at the dowager empress' birthday party. Here we see how deftly the pseudomonk played on Alexandra's fears.Goldman alters chronology for dramatic effect even when the historical record is dramatic enough. The film has Alexei's nearfatal illness at Spala followed by celebrations for the Romanovs' 300th anniversary and the shooting of Prime Minister Stolypin. In fact Stolypin died in 1911 Alexei's illness was in 1912 and the Romanov tercentenary in 1913. What Goldman hoped to achieve by shuffling these events is unclear. Possibly it was to juxtapose Alexei's recovery at Spala and Rasputin's consequent vindication with the outbreak of World War I when Alexandra acting for an absent Nicholas appointed hopelessly unqualified ministers Rasputin recommended men in whose hands the Tsar's government collapsed in 1917. But if this was Goldman's intent he failed to make his meaning clear.Many scenes are sanitized especially the last. We know they'll be shot. The director's endless delay of that moment as the family sits in that basement room is unbearable if not inexcusable. The shooting itself is so brisk that but for the guns we would hardly know what was happening. That said I hope no film ever recreates the family's last minutes as Greg King and Penny Wilson reconstruct them in excruciating detail using archival accounts by members of the firing squad and the forensic evidence of the bones recovered in 1979 King and Wilson The Fate of the Romanovs Hoboken 2003 chapter 12.Reviewers here criticize the scene invented by Goldman in which Tatiana disrobes before a young guard. Astoundingly however King and Wilson found documentary proof that during a snap inspection of the Ipatiev house on June 27 1918 Grand Duchess Marie was found in a compromising situation with a guard named Ivan Skorokhodov King and Wilson Fate of the Romanovs pp. 24347. Documents proving this were still hidden away in Goldman's day. His invention of Tatiana's selfexposure thus reveals that he did have a dramatic sense of and made an effort to portray the feelings he realized these tragic young women experienced as they endured confinement and faced death. The documents do not reveal details of Marie's situation but the event proved that security at the house was unreliable. With the White Army approaching Ekaterinburg Marie's peccadillo led to the local Soviet's decision to execute the entire family three weeks later.".

	schema:headline " Moving Modern Epic";
	schema:reviewBody "Nicholas and Alexandra is an example of what might be called the modern epic the genre which sought to apply the scale and techniques of the Biblical or Classical epic to episodes from nineteenth or twentieth history. Although ancient history epics fell out of favour after the midsixties the modern epic had a longer shelflife surviving into the eighties Gandhi The Last Emperor and even the nineties Titanic.Perhaps the greatest exponent of the modern epic was David Lean the director of Bridge on the River Kwai Lawrence of Arabia Dr Zhivago and Ryan's Daughter. He also attempted to make A Passage to India in a similar style although it is a style not really suited to Forster's novel. It may have been the success of Dr Zhivago which persuaded the makers of this film to try another epic with a Russian theme although this time based upon fact rather than a work of fiction. It tells the story of Nicholas II the last Tsar of Russia and his wife Alexandra. Although it is a lengthy film around three hours in length it does not tell the story of their courtship which might have made an interesting film in itself given Nicholas's father's opposition to Alexandra as a daughterinlaw nor of the early years of their marriage. It begins around 1904 the time of Russia's defeat in the RussoJapanese War and of the birth of the couple's only son Alexis.Nicholas was a strange and contradictory character. In his public life he was determined to defend Russia's autocratic system of government even though his weak and vacillating personality made him an unlikely and unsuitable autocrat. In private however he was a kindly man deeply in love with his wife and a loving father to his children. Similar contradictions can be seen in the characters of two other monarchs who fell victims to revolutions Charles I of England and Louis XVI of France. Alexandra however beloved she may have been by her husband and family was never popular with the Russian people. This was partly due to her German background the Germans for political reasons were often disliked in Russia at this period partly because she was seen as cold and aloof and partly because she had fallen under the influence of the mystic Rasputin who was widely though incorrectly believed to be her lover.Epics about turnofthecentury royalty have not always been successful Mayerling made a few years earlier about another doomed pair of royal lovers Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria and his mistress Marie Vetsera was sumptuous to look at but otherwise uninteresting. Nicholas and Alexandra by contrast is as visually attractive as the earlier film but a much better film all round. Whereas Mayerling featured two bigname stars Omar Sharif and Catherine Deneuve in the leading roles Nicholas and Alexandra are played by two relatively unknown actors Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman and it is the unknowns who come off best. In the hands of Sharif and Deneuve Rudolf and Marie remain dull and inert whereas Jayston who bears a close resemblance to the late Tsar and Suzman succeed in making their characters threedimensional and well rounded sympathetic despite their alltooobvious flaws. There are some other excellent contributions from Tom Baker the future Doctor Who as Rasputin here portrayed not as an outright villain but as a man possessed of a certain spirituality despite his own character weaknesses such as a taste for strong drink and pretty women from Michael Bryant as Lenin played as an arrogant autocratinthemaking and from Timothy West as the Imperial Family's loyal doctor.After the Revolution of 1917 the Communists tried to portray their seizure of power as the inevitable result of ineluctable historical forces. In reality the replacement of a bad system by a worse one was anything but inevitable. Although Tsarist autocracy was by the early twentieth century an anachronistic institution and one that was probably unsustainable in the long run many Russians still retained a certain affection for their Batyushka or Little Father and the system might well have lasted much longer but for chance factors. We see Lenin and his comrades in their Zurich exile lamenting the seeming indestructibility of the Russian monarchy and fearing that their own movement is doomed to failure. What sealed the doom of Tsarism and allowed the Communists their chance was the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and the poor performance of the Russian armies leading to popular unrest to the fall of the regime in March 1917 and the final triumph of the Bolsheviks in November of that year after a brief doomed attempt to create a liberal democracy. John McEnery is very good as the idealistic Kerensky leader of the democratic forces whose idealism is frustrated first by the stubbornness of the Tsar and then by the ruthlessness of the Communists.The most moving scenes in the film are the final ones when the Romanovs are being held prisoner. The tone of these scenes is cold bleak and forbidding a deliberate contrast to the visual splendours of the earlier scenes in the Imperial palaces. There is yet another good performance from Alan Webb as the hypocritical Yurovsky the family's jailer who welcomes them with seeming politeness while all the time plotting their murder on the orders of his superiors in Moscow. The final scene when Nicholas Alexandra their children and their servants are gunned down by Yurovsky and his men is unbearably poignant. A fitting end to this excellent film. 810".

It tells the story of Nicholas II the last Tsar of Russia and his wife Alexandra. Although it is a lengthy film around three hours in length it does not tell the story of their courtship which might have made an interesting film in itself given Nicholas's father's opposition to Alexandra as a daughterinlaw nor of the early years of their marriage. It begins around 1904 the time of Russia's defeat in the RussoJapanese War and of the birth of the couple's only son Alexis.Nicholas was a strange and contradictory character. In his public life he was determined to defend Russia's autocratic system of government even though his weak and vacillating personality made him an unlikely and unsuitable autocrat. In private however he was a kindly man deeply in love with his wife and a loving father to his children. Similar contradictions can be seen in the characters of two other monarchs who fell victims to revolutions Charles I of England and Louis XVI of France. Alexandra however beloved she may have been by her husband and family was never popular with the Russian people. This was partly due to her German background the Germans for political reasons were often disliked in Russia at this period partly because she was seen as cold and aloof and partly because she had fallen under the influence of the mystic Rasputin who was widely though incorrectly believed to be her lover.Epics about turnofthecentury royalty have not always been successful Mayerling made a few years earlier about another doomed pair of royal lovers Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria and his mistress Marie Vetsera was sumptuous to look at but otherwise uninteresting. Nicholas and Alexandra by contrast is as visually attractive as the earlier film but a much better film all round. Whereas Mayerling featured two bigname stars Omar Sharif and Catherine Deneuve in the leading roles Nicholas and Alexandra are played by two relatively unknown actors Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman and it is the unknowns who come off best. In the hands of Sharif and Deneuve Rudolf and Marie remain dull and inert whereas Jayston who bears a close resemblance to the late Tsar and Suzman succeed in making their characters threedimensional and well rounded sympathetic despite their alltooobvious flaws. There are some other excellent contributions from Tom Baker the future Doctor Who as Rasputin here portrayed not as an outright villain but as a man possessed of a certain spirituality despite his own character weaknesses such as a taste for strong drink and pretty women from Michael Bryant as Lenin played as an arrogant autocratinthemaking and from Timothy West as the Imperial Family's loyal doctor.After the Revolution of 1917 the Communists tried to portray their seizure of power as the inevitable result of ineluctable historical forces. In reality the replacement of a bad system by a worse one was anything but inevitable. Although Tsarist autocracy was by the early twentieth century an anachronistic institution and one that was probably unsustainable in the long run many Russians still retained a certain affection for their Batyushka or Little Father and the system might well have lasted much longer but for chance factors. We see Lenin and his comrades in their Zurich exile lamenting the seeming indestructibility of the Russian monarchy and fearing that their own movement is doomed to failure. What sealed the doom of Tsarism and allowed the Communists their chance was the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and the poor performance of the Russian armies leading to popular unrest to the fall of the regime in March 1917 and the final triumph of the Bolsheviks in November of that year after a brief doomed attempt to create a liberal democracy. John McEnery is very good as the idealistic Kerensky leader of the democratic forces whose idealism is frustrated first by the stubbornness of the Tsar and then by the ruthlessness of the Communists.The most moving scenes in the film are the final ones when the Romanovs are being held prisoner. The tone of these scenes is cold bleak and forbidding a deliberate contrast to the visual splendours of the earlier scenes in the Imperial palaces. There is yet another good performance from Alan Webb as the hypocritical Yurovsky the family's jailer who welcomes them with seeming politeness while all the time plotting their murder on the orders of his superiors in Moscow. The final scene when Nicholas Alexandra their children and their servants are gunned down by Yurovsky and his men is unbearably poignant. A fitting end to this excellent film. 810";

It's certainly an amazing true story about a couple who literally lost an empire a mad monk who played a crucial role in their downfall and the transformation of a huge nation from one form of tyrannical oppression to another.

The drama focuses on their descent from opulent splendour to powerlessness exile housearrest and ultimately assassination at the hands of the communists. Produced by the legendary Sam Spiegel the film is filled with amazing sets and costumes all beautifully photographed by Freddie Young. The largely unknown cast are excellent most notably Baker as the rapacious Rasputin who wormed his way into the Empress' affections and in his own way was more of a revolutionary than Lenin Stalin or Trotsky and Olivier as prime minister Witte who delivers an impassioned speech on the folly of the Great War. This is a great drama and an enjoyable epic but also a pointed history lesson for those interested in what eventually befalls all nobility. Do you think the Windsors have seen it ?".

	schema:reviewBody "Nicholas and Alexandra is one of the last of the grand sweeping epics that dominated the box office in the 50's and 60's. With the new wave of young reckless directors who took to the scene in the 70's this kind of filmmaking seemed strangely dated. Ironically enough it kind of mimics the fate of the Romanov family holding on to ideals that can no longer protect them. The genre which had started with aplomb with movies like Gone With The Wind didn't draw the numbers it used to and after seeing this movie I can't help but think of what a shame that is.The movie is off to a slow start and doesn't really grab the viewer until after the introduction of Rasputin. From there on in it's pure cinematic joy to witness the fate of the Tzar and his family unravel. The actors do a tremendous job. It's obvious that the producers wanted their actors to look as much like their characters as possible and while this doesn't necessarily strengthen the movie by itself it clearly gives it a stronger feel of authenticity. Furthermore they perfectly embody their flawed characters. The czar beautifully played by Michael Jayston is a warm caring man who unfortunately is totally unfit to be a czar. He is out of touch with his people and feebly clings to his autocratic power. Jayston manages to portray an almost absurd certainty in his divine right and ability to rule while at the same time exposing his uncertainty and fright. Janet Suzman is equally impressive as the loving but domineering Alexandra.The look and feel of the movie is also fantastic. The jawdropping visuals of Russia perfectly accommodates the story and the music is wonderful all the way through. The pace is slow and it's easy to see why critics who had just witnessed the exhilarating pace of movies like A Clockwork Orange or The French Connection. But this was how these kinds of movies were made and Nicholas and Alexandra does not shame the genre. It's actually a beautiful end to a spectacular genre which is well worth a look for anyone with a soft spot for David Leanlike movies.".

This was all about the Russian czars from Peter the Great and Catherine the Great up to and including Nicholas II the main subject of this movie. The course has a slogan It started with a bang and ended with a bang. The familial execution of Nicholas II and his beloved family was all too soon replaced by the Soviet Union and Leninism permanently or so it was thought.I hear bad and good things about Nicholas. He crushed many groups of his enemies early on and even toward the end of the nineteenth century. Also that he was a victim of his growing oppositional forces that there were three Russian Revolutions one in 1905 and two in 1917 and that Rasputin sold Nicholas' whole family out which led to their grisly executions. Also that Rasputin was hard to kill it took many times to take hold and that his dead body was eventually found in a river or canal. The boy just wouldn't die even after poisoning that would have killed five to ten people by itself.This movie was on for most of the night last night to 330 this morning TCM. I had to get up fairly early but could not stop watching. Rasputin was the creepy villain I have always been told he was with the mesmerizing effect on Alexandra. She believed Rasputin would save her son's life like many people today in the U.S. who believe televangelists will save their loved ones' lives. I have seen in other media Rasputin portrayed by Lionel Barrymore and Alan Rickman. This particular Rasputin looked amazingly like pictures of the real Rasputin I have seen on the web. I have also heard that Rasputin was quite the ladies' man and this movie alludes and also on the web I learned about the preservation and worship of the enormous member that was removed from Rasputin at the time of his murder.I have always wondered if there was truth to the stupid gossip about Rasputin hooking up with Alexandra. He was ugly to look at but looks aren't everything.The boy portraying Alexei was superb and so was the actor portraying his father. I enjoyed recognizing the more known stars in the movie although not in major parts including Michael Redgrave Laurence Olivier and Jack Hawkins. The four daughters were dressed and coiffed elegantly at least until their time in Siberia. Even in the final room these 'girls' looked quite professional despite I am sure no maids to bathe and dress them.The sailornurse in charge of Alexei did a great job. I enjoyed seeing his historic uniform as I am a student of historic fashion design as well as other things. I read online that the real Alexei had two male nannies attending to his needs.The Leninportrayer gave quite a chilling performance and I feel that his makeup beard etc. were perfect.A character in the movie predicted that the Tsarist empire would go the way of the dodobird ala the Roman Empire and other failed civilizations and he was right. The irony is that the thenbirthing Soviet empire is now a hasbeen also.".

	schema:headline " A Beautiful Forgotten Epic!";
	schema:reviewBody "Nicholas and Alexandra is one of those films that no one has ever seen and unfortunately no one ever will. It's essentially one of those longforgotten epics. But if you have seen the film it's a film you'll never regret seeing. It's long and sometime can be tedious to sit through but it's a very fascinating history lesson. One of the big films of 1971 was Fiddler on the Roof which viewed Russian life through the eyes of the peasantry. Now this film takes place during the Russian Revolution through the eyes of the monarchy. The film talks about the tragic rule of Czar Nicholas ll which led to the abdication of the throne and the collapse of the monarchy. The film is very romantic in the sense of being very beautiful to look at. The art direction is splendid and the costume design seems realistic for the time period it was set in.Franklin J. Schaffner's film tells the story about Czar Nicholas ll the monarch who showed indifference towards the peasants in which caused over seven million deaths. Now being forced to fight in the Great War the Russian people have had enough. The cities are being torn apart with riots. People and factions such as the Bolsheviks are plotting to overthrow the government. So Nicholas decides to abdicate the throne and he and his family are exiled in the frigid land of Siberia.I think the acting was solid. The two leads are actors I have never heard of until my viewing of the film but I was impressed at what I saw. Michael Jayston does well as Nicholas ll and even has similar looks. He does a good job at showing indifference towards practically everything. Maybe he overacted with his facial expressions but he did a rather good job. I really liked Janet Suzman's performance as the influential wife of Nicholas Alexandra. She has great chemistry with not only Jayston but also Tom Baker who portrayed the mystical Rasputin a selfproclaimed man of God. We also get some good supporting turns from the likes of Laurence Olivier Ian Holm Brian Cox and Jack Hawkins.Overall Nicholas and Alexandra is a beautiful film to look at mainly because of those fantastic period designs. The story is also very meaningful as it describes one of the world's most infamous revolutions to ever have happened. This is not the best epic set within this era. I believe that honor goes to Doctor Zhivago. I would have loved to see more about the revolution. The story itself seems impacted because the revolution itself wasn't the most significant part of the story. I would have loved to seen more of Lenin or Trotsky. But on the whole I really enjoyed watching this tragic story of what happened to end Czarist Russia.My Grade A".

	schema:headline " An excellent and sorely underrated film";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the last films in the great tradition of the historical epics which dominated the 1950s and 1960s it begins with the birth of Tsarevich Alexei the apple of his parents' eye on August 12 1904 and ends with the murders of the entire Romanov family on July 17 1918. While the film suffers from a few pacing problems it is nevertheless a hugely entertaining and very well written film with often marvellous dialogue. Franklin J. Schaffner of Planet of the Apes my sixth favourite film of all time and Patton fame does a great job as the director.As the title characters Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman are excellent delivering subtle understated performances. They have great chemistry. Throughout the film you never doubt that they love each other. Nicholas II is depicted as a weakwilled indecisive and not terribly bright man who loves his family but whose personality makes him utterly unsuited to his position. He fails to listen to the good advice of his prime ministers most notably Count Witte and often takes unwise courses of action at the behest of his strong willed wife. It is not until far too late after he has already lost his throne that he engages in some form of selfreflection and realises all of the mistakes that he made. My sympathy for him grew as the film progressed and he became an increasingly tragic figure. He may have been the Tsar but he always seemed to be someone's pawn rather than his own man. I think that in the film at least he became a better man after being forced to abdicate. Alexandra  who was hated because she was German  seems to be more intelligent than her husband who is under her thumb and tells her as much at one point. However her judgement is as bad as his or possibly even worse as she falls under the influence of Rasputin. She is blinded to his crimes and misdemeanours by her love for Alexei and the mystic's apparent ability to control his haemophilia. She is a less sympathetic character than Nicholas in part because she says expressly at one point that on reflection she could think of anything that she had done wrong in the years leading up to 1917. I've no idea if this statement has any historical basis whatsoever but it worked well in the context of the film as she appears to be as blind to her own faults as she was to those of Rasputin. I sympathised with her most strongly when it came to Alexei's poor health as it was a terrible burden for any mother to bear.Laurence Olivier excels as Count Witte the Cassandra of Russia whose consistently sensible advice is ignored by Nicholas and who as in reality warned that disaster would result from Russia's entry into World War I. I suppose that he was lucky that he did not live to see the Revolution. In his first major role Tom Baker cast at Olivier's suggestion was perfect for the role of Rasputin playing him with a wonderful sense of intensity. He comes across as a very dangerous intelligent manipulative and amoral man who was perhaps the worst possible choice for an adviser. The film has a very strong supporting cast overall Timothy West Ian Holm John Wood Roy Dotrice Michael Redgrave whose daughter Vanessa was considered for Alexandra Julian Glover Alan Webb and John McEnery as Alexander Kerensky who died only a year and a half before the film was released. McEnery looks the image of him incidentally.On the negative side the film is too long at three hours and six minutes. It suffers from pacing problems for a full half four from about 60 to 90 minutes into its long run. They could have probably cut at least half an hour of flab here and there without it making much difference. While the scenes in the first half featuring the Bolsheviks were necessary for later in the film they weren't terribly good or interesting. The film hues fairly closely to history but takes a few liberties. For instance Stalin and Lenin meet a few years too early and Stolypin is assassinated in 1913 rather than 1911. I thought that it was rather odd that while several of the events surrounding the 1905 Revolution were depicted or discussed there was no direct mention of the Revolution itself. The film jumps forward from 1905 to 1913 very suddenly and it was a bit distracting as even given the film's length it felt like it was leaving something out. The second half beginning with the outbreak of World War I is much stronger than the first and the film rollicks along at a great pace from then onwards. There is a great sense of foreboding in the second half as the story draws to its tragic conclusion. The film does a fantastic job of contrasting the opulence of the Winter Palace with both the poor living conditions of the Russian people and those of the Romanovs themselves after the Revolution.Overall this is an excellent film which is neither as successful nor as well remembered as it deserves to be. Were it for its aforementioned problems I would have certainly given it full marks.".

	onyx:emotionText "One of the last films in the great tradition of the historical epics which dominated the 1950s and 1960s it begins with the birth of Tsarevich Alexei the apple of his parents' eye on August 12 1904 and ends with the murders of the entire Romanov family on July 17 1918. While the film suffers from a few pacing problems it is nevertheless a hugely entertaining and very well written film with often marvellous dialogue. Franklin J. Schaffner of Planet of the Apes my sixth favourite film of all time and Patton fame does a great job as the director.As the title characters Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman are excellent delivering subtle understated performances. They have great chemistry. Throughout the film you never doubt that they love each other. Nicholas II is depicted as a weakwilled indecisive and not terribly bright man who loves his family but whose personality makes him utterly unsuited to his position. He fails to listen to the good advice of his prime ministers most notably Count Witte and often takes unwise courses of action at the behest of his strong willed wife. It is not until far too late after he has already lost his throne that he engages in some form of selfreflection and realises all of the mistakes that he made. My sympathy for him grew as the film progressed and he became an increasingly tragic figure. He may have been the Tsar but he always seemed to be someone's pawn rather than his own man. I think that in the film at least he became a better man after being forced to abdicate. Alexandra  who was hated because she was German  seems to be more intelligent than her husband who is under her thumb and tells her as much at one point. However her judgement is as bad as his or possibly even worse as she falls under the influence of Rasputin. She is blinded to his crimes and misdemeanours by her love for Alexei and the mystic's apparent ability to control his haemophilia. She is a less sympathetic character than Nicholas in part because she says expressly at one point that on reflection she could think of anything that she had done wrong in the years leading up to 1917. I've no idea if this statement has any historical basis whatsoever but it worked well in the context of the film as she appears to be as blind to her own faults as she was to those of Rasputin. I sympathised with her most strongly when it came to Alexei's poor health as it was a terrible burden for any mother to bear.Laurence Olivier excels as Count Witte the Cassandra of Russia whose consistently sensible advice is ignored by Nicholas and who as in reality warned that disaster would result from Russia's entry into World War I. I suppose that he was lucky that he did not live to see the Revolution. In his first major role Tom Baker cast at Olivier's suggestion was perfect for the role of Rasputin playing him with a wonderful sense of intensity. He comes across as a very dangerous intelligent manipulative and amoral man who was perhaps the worst possible choice for an adviser. The film has a very strong supporting cast overall Timothy West Ian Holm John Wood Roy Dotrice Michael Redgrave whose daughter Vanessa was considered for Alexandra Julian Glover Alan Webb and John McEnery as Alexander Kerensky who died only a year and a half before the film was released. McEnery looks the image of him incidentally.On the negative side the film is too long at three hours and six minutes.

	schema:reviewBody "Opening with the birth of Alexis  the hemophiliac son of Nicholas II the last Czar of Russia and his wife Alexandra this then traces the history of the Romanovs from that point until their eventual execution by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. As far as the big picture is concerned this is reasonably accurate. All of the major events of those years are portrayed so one gets a sense of the course of Russian history during the era. When we move into the details the fictionalized material that's added in is believable enough for the most part. The viewer gets a feel for what life was like in Russia during this period and the point is also made of how isolated the Royal Family was from the struggles of the average Russian family.Having said that I still thought this movie was lacking. Mostly it lacked real and believable emotion. I didn't get a sense of passion from any of the cast. They performed their parts well enough. I could buy most of them in their roles. But the feeling was strangely absent which made this very long 3 hours movie seem even longer to be honest. I was somewhat surprised by the somewhat limited amount of time that was given to Rasputin  who in reality became a surprisingly influential figure in the Russian court but I appreciated the scenes following the Czar's abdication. Somehow I was able to enter into what must have been the extremely humbling and even humiliating circumstances into which the Romanovs fell afterward  they who had held absolute power over the Russian people as the successors to a dynasty that had ruled for 300 years suddenly at the mercy of those who held them prisoner. The movie depicts them as very dignified in the circumstances and the final scene is quite brutal leaving one with feelings of sympathy for the family and especially their children who were surely not responsible for whatever evil their father may have been accused of.This has plenty of weaknesses but is still worth watching if only to get something of a grand sweep of the revolutionary era in Russian history.".

	schema:headline " Small Wonder had more convincing robots";
	schema:reviewBody "A truly magnificent work of unintentional comedy Android Insurrection is an astonishingly incompetent piece of film making. Sandwiched between opening and closing jumbosized slabs of expository monologue the story is a fairly straightforward military fantasy. Per contemporary convention there's an elite team of arrogant meatheads and hot babes who are the last line of defense against The Threat  in this case robots. Of course there are complications and at least one major character discovery that anyone can see from the beginning of the movie. Through the course of this tediously familiar journey the actors stumble over dialog that doesn't serve to advance any story but really just create argumentative conflict often lifting classic lines such as skin job and nuke it from space. And since we never really learn anything about most of the cannon fodder here we don't really care when meat hits the fan. Which is frequently. I'm no military expert but if I were in a fire fight I'd probably duck when the shooting starts. But not this elite team. Sluggishly reacting against computer generated targets that were added later the cast look as energized as my grandfather putting on the 4th hole at Leisure World. I'd like to blame that all on director Bellware giving his actors nothing but a green screen to act against. But these people can't even carry convincing conversation with one another. It doesn't help that the commanding colonel barks orders with a hilariously awful stagecomic German accent and why German anyway?.

	onyx:emotionText "A truly magnificent work of unintentional comedy Android Insurrection is an astonishingly incompetent piece of film making. Sandwiched between opening and closing jumbosized slabs of expository monologue the story is a fairly straightforward military fantasy. Per contemporary convention there's an elite team of arrogant meatheads and hot babes who are the last line of defense against The Threat  in this case robots. Of course there are complications and at least one major character discovery that anyone can see from the beginning of the movie. Through the course of this tediously familiar journey the actors stumble over dialog that doesn't serve to advance any story but really just create argumentative conflict often lifting classic lines such as skin job and nuke it from space. And since we never really learn anything about most of the cannon fodder here we don't really care when meat hits the fan. Which is frequently. I'm no military expert but if I were in a fire fight I'd probably duck when the shooting starts. But not this elite team. Sluggishly reacting against computer generated targets that were added later the cast look as energized as my grandfather putting on the 4th hole at Leisure World. I'd like to blame that all on director Bellware giving his actors nothing but a green screen to act against. But these people can't even carry convincing conversation with one another. It doesn't help that the commanding colonel barks orders with a hilariously awful stagecomic German accent and why German anyway?. But then there's the red haired android  a sort of eyecandy slurry of Cherry 2000's Melanie Griffith and the Fifth Element's Leeloo  who combines a clumsy interpretation of robot mannerisms with Valley Girl uptalking.

As to special effects my son created better when he took his first computer class in grade school. The guns don't even shoot. The muzzle blasts are added sometimes not even lined up with the guns.

	schema:reviewBody "I am not sure where to start. This is a very bad film but has some camp value. The film takes place in the year 2532. We know robots have taken over all of our tasks but we don't know anything about society or why there is a desert between Philadelphia and New York why it is called the Philadelphia Desert or why the young Prince of England is there being held captive by a robot. Afterwards a group of humans take on the task of rescuing an android and whatever humans they can find from a rogue AI manufacturing facility which looks like a large 20th century metal frame warehouse complete with office cubicles and marksalot eraser boards.The crew takes their orders from a man David Ian Lee with a varying bad German accent Elvis chops and a Hitler mustache. The android they rescue SarahDoe Osborne is one of those jerk your head around androids. The special effects were made worse once it got to the editors where they ensured the sounds of gun fire and the CG gun flames hopelessly don't match. There is a Star Wars type light laser. Sometimes it uses a blue CG light but in battle the laser looks like it is plastic pea green. There were a lot of pauses as if the actors forgot their lines. Oh yes. The film has a twist but at that point who cares? Virginia Logan is the main actor in this one. She runs around showing off her bare midriff. Her name is Foxwell perhaps to make us think about a low budget Transformers Megan Fox. She tried to carry the film but it was just too much of a stinker.The film is worse than a SyFy production or Asylum. The beginning has a long narration about robots and likewise the ending has an extremely long boring narration followed by the movie credits...Seriously who does that? 8th graders?The DVD cover says brief nudity which is kind of odd because the film itself has no nudity. It does have BW nudity at the very beginning to present the film logo but none in the main body of the film.Parental Guide Fbombs. No sex. Aforesaid nudity. 9.96 Walmart. They took me.

We know robots have taken over all of our tasks but we don't know anything about society or why there is a desert between Philadelphia and New York why it is called the Philadelphia Desert or why the young Prince of England is there being held captive by a robot. Afterwards a group of humans take on the task of rescuing an android and whatever humans they can find from a rogue AI manufacturing facility which looks like a large 20th century metal frame warehouse complete with office cubicles and marksalot eraser boards.The crew takes their orders from a man David Ian Lee with a varying bad German accent Elvis chops and a Hitler mustache. The android they rescue SarahDoe Osborne is one of those jerk your head around androids. The special effects were made worse once it got to the editors where they ensured the sounds of gun fire and the CG gun flames hopelessly don't match. There is a Star Wars type light laser.

The cgi was gawd AWFUL the acting was worse and the story line was non existent. What the hell kind of 1st year film student at local community college came up with this piece of film dung.! I'm not actor but i guarantee i could act better than anyone in this movie and i particularly liked the previous comment that better cgi could have been made on a commodore 64. Not only was this supposed to take place in an underground warehouse but also 400 years or so in the future?? has anyone noticed the Red 2010 Ticket on the fire extinguisher in the underground bunker? WTF. I didn't know paper lasted 500 years in an office room setting. And whats up with the 84 dodge pickup parked in the garage? And if they were so desperate to get to the surface and out of the building why the fK didn't they just hit the button for the 40 foot roll up door lining the whole backdrop of the set? It takes a real genuine masterpiece POS to get me to have to sign up on this site and vent. Like i said i didn't have to pay for this moviethank god and thankfully i was able to fast forward thru most of the REALLY awful dialogs which was most of the movie but then i found myself saying WTF just happened so I actually had to rewind back thru just to see how or where things progressed only to be stumped further. If you thought the Legend of Bogey Creek was a cheesy campy film then you are in for a real treat with this POS! I spent the whole time watching this movie and shaking my head just unable to believe someone could actually make something this AWFUL. I've never seen a Po's like this  and on the POS scale i give it a solid 10!".

Budget so low there are only 3 types of robots and 1 is used 3 times as guards. The plot involves a group of soldiers sent to retrieve a robot from a robot stronghold. That is about it. The stronghold looks like an office building and a garage. The robots look about on line with PS1 graphics and the acting is awful. Flat dialog left and right as the actors go through the motions. For a min I thought I was watching something from the asylum but even they are not responsible for this train wreck. You know its a chore if you're looking at the clock several times during its 75 min running time. The CGI is about as cheap as the budget. The robots look bad the gunfire is cgi and as the actors just shoot wildly at the green screen you can't help but laugh. A time waster if anything and only for those who can watch bad movies longer than 10 min.".

Sure it's low budget but that does not excuse a bad plot bad script and a silly ending. It was filmed completely in some large industrial building which in itself is not really bad but it is supposed to be a mile underground and there are current era vehicles film set far in future and windows in the machine shop not to mention the 1990's stereo photocopier and much more. Guess they did their best to hide much and use the same setdec for many scenes. I particularly liked the footsteps that do not change sound regardless of the floor covering speed or force of step  and at times not synchronized with the actual motion. So much random shooting and uncoordinated flashbangs in this film and many of the scenes skip over where special effects should have been cant afford just skip the frame and hope the viewers don't realize. lol. I shall end with one word awful.".

This time however the scientist decides not to pay for his next cadaverkilling the visitor instead by removing his legs with a buzzsaw booby trap and using his reanimated severed head in a series of tests.Eventually the girlfriend of the dead guy comes looking for her beau but also becomes a victim of the dwarf thus providing him with a suitable body into which he can finally transplant his sister's 'consciousness'.A rather tongueincheek effort Android of Notre Dame is far removed from the first two Guinea Pig movies which attempted to be as nasty and as realistic as possible this one features lots of hokey gore and unconvincing surgical procedures including a particularly messy scene featuring rough 'n' ready rib removal which make it a fairly entertaining experience for those who like their horror rather twisted and laden with blood but not in the least bit disturbing.As far as I am concerned mad dwarfs gratuitous violence and naked women always make a film watchable so I wouldn't consider AOND to be a complete waste of 51 minutes but those expecting anything quite as horrific as Flowers of Flesh and Blood Guinea Pig 2 will be rather disappointed.".

Unearthed does a great job with the transfer quality but that doesn't save this piece of garbage.

But that doesn't mean that it was all that bad. The Guinea Pig is known for it's socalled snuff flicks but this is also a worth seeing.It all reminded me of Reanimator 1985. We also have the severed head being reanimated but this here goes a bit further in part of the gore. It starts off rather slowly and in the beginning I was thinking what's the fuss here but after a while when the brother who wants to save his sister is ready to catch a victim the gore and nudity comes in. First he's experimenting on a naked female and that doesn't work that well but like I said once he captured a live species this flick turns into a gorefest. Still not as some other entries in the franchise but the removal of the heart looks rather real. If you are a big fan of Reanimator then you must see this. If you are a fan of weird Japanese flicks then you will like this too.Gore 25 Nudity 15 Effects 35 Story 35 Comedy 05".
