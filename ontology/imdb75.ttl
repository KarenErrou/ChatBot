David finds a job with the local gardener Andersson Douglas Hge despite the opposition of his despicable wife and befriends two peddlers and a neighbor. When Hkansson offers to sell the cottage to David Maggi discloses that she is pregnant of a stranger she had met a couple of months before she knew David. But sooner the naive couple leans the bureaucracy of his country and the selfish human nature of his neighbors. The romance Det regnar p vr krlek is the second film of Ingmar Bergman about a young couple with a questionable past that decides to move together to build a new life and finds how the selfish human nature of their fellowships and the behavior of the authorities of their country. The story recalled me Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life of the same year with the defense attorney acting like an angel in the lives of Maggi and David when there was no more hope to the couple.

The young star director Ingmar Bergman here effectively portrays typically good and bad sides of the human behaviour. The main theme returns over and over again  how do people live with their past and how do they handle the resulting conflicts and moral dilemmas? Despite the age of this movie released in 1946 it does not feel old fashioned in any way. Common to Bergman's movies to come this one is way ahead of its time. The story and acting feel just as fresh as any modern movie and is a pure enjoyment to watch without any boring or embarrassing moments.".

It Rains on our Love is not one of his very best it starts off a little formulaic and slow and while there are some very interesting and wellexplored themes they were even more fully explored later on. It Rains on our Love is beautifully shot and striking to look at and Bergman's direction is adept and disciplined as usual. The dialogue provokes thought and the story is moving and compelling. I admired that It Rains on our Love didn't resort too much to melodrama and none of it felt cheap and overlysentimental. The ending even has some optimism that doesn't feel forced in any way. And then there is the cast who are exemplary. Birger Malmstem and Barbro Kollberg are strong in the lead roles but the wry performances from Bergman regulars Erland Josephson and Gunnar Bjornstrand were even better.Overall while not one of Bergman's very best it is very good and well done and one of his better early films easily. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "This early Bergman work contains several interesting ideas that are expressed more fully in his more mature later films. The tale of a pair of juvenile delinquents trying to reform but finding themselves trapped by social conventions this could easily have been a clichd melodrama but it fortunately transcends its formulaic beginnings to become quite a sophisticated though not wholly successful piece.The two homeless characters meet at the beginning of the film and rapidly fall in love as they seek shelter from a storm that symbolises in a very simple way the turmoil in their lives. They quickly find their sanctuary accessed by illegal means is not the haven they expected however when its own catches them trespassing on his property.The events which follow show the couple dealing with various crises in their lives sometimes maturely and sometimes with relapses into their past delinquency. It is this nuanced characterisation that makes this film transcend lesser works in the same genre.The constant challenges and temptations the characters encounter and their responses are the subject of a literal and symbolic trial at the film's end in which a mysterious omniscient lawyerfigure both defends and chastises them whilst at the same time exposes the hypocrisy and narrowmindedness that has poisoned the small town where they dwell.The lawyer figure works successfully as a narrator and conscience figure for the characters and lifts the story out of the confines of realism. Whilst the notion of characters trying to reform their lives but finding themselves trapped by a selfrighteously moralistic society may seem trite the fact that they are not wholly exonerated nor the town wholly condemned lends added credence to the lawyer's critique as the story contrasts the true nature of Christian love and compassion against religious and social legalism.The trial also works effectively as the film's climax after the quickening in pace as the couple face mounting tribulations in the second half of the second half of the story.The weather motif recurs throughout and reflects the ups and downs in fortune that the couple experience as they battle their temptations and face such adversaries as a duplicitous landlord and uncaring government bureaucracy.Ultimately this is an enjoyable film with a few profound insights yet it falls short of the greatness of Bergman's later films. Viewers should not be discouraged from seeking it out though as the time spent watching it will be wellinvested.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a classic.  I will admit that the main reason I watch so many horror movies is mainly because I can make fun of them.  I bought Alligator from a video store that was going out of business.  I vaguely remembered the scene where the alligator crashes the birthday party from when I was a little kid. Anyway I remembered enough to pick it up so I was expecting another movie that I could sit there and trash but once I saw John Sayles's name in the writing credits I assumed that I would be in for something more.  Instead of getting a movie that I could laugh at I got one that laughs at itself for being a horror movie about 16 years before that was cool.  The script is supersharp with witty lines and the direction is tight. We also get a great charismatic Robert Forster playing the role of the burnout cop and Henry Silva makes a HILARIOUS cameo as a hunter.  I don't know if his performance was intentionally bad or if he was just trying to be that bad but either way it worked.  I loved his character and the funny noises that he makes.  I'm sure it had to be intentional.John Sayles has done some great horror scripts.  Just check out Piranah and The Howling the first one.  He scores another knockout with Alligator and it put Lake Placid to shame.  What that movie seemed to try so hard at making a parody of sorts Alligator pulls off with ease.  The specialeffects of course they're dated by now are actually really welldone for the time and in many ways a helluva lot more convincing than most of the CGI crap that we're forcefed today.If you can find this movie I highly reccommend it.  No it's not scary but it is very entertaining and a good time all the way through.".

You can just hear the haunting whistle of an Ennio Morricone soundtrack as the showdown looms.This monster flick's pedigree is a purebred B written by Corman alumnus John Sayles fresh from 1978's 'Piranha' on his way to 1981's 'The Howling' and directed by veteran Lewis Teague who cut his directing and editing teeth on such Corman classics as 'The Lady In Red' 'Cockfighter' 'Crazy Mama' and the immortal 'Death Race 2000'.Casting for 'Alligator' was made in Cult Heaven with Tarantinofave Robert Forster as the badluck cop who gets between the girl and her gator. Future 'Stepmonster' Robin Riker makes her movie debut as the reptile expert. '50s scifi veteran Dean Jagger looking sweartoGod like the dancing octogenarian in the Six Flags commercials plays the dastardly industrialist who kills puppies and inadvertently creates the monster. Henry Silva seems to have fun skewering his cinema psycho persona.

Romantic foreplay includes heartfelt talks about male pattern baldness. The gator seems to have a Jones for men in blue.

Robert Forster as the detective out to track down the killer gator gives a good performance. real stand out is Henry Silva as the military man sent to destroy the monster gator. He plays him like a broad stereotype of a general from some Latin American dictatorship.    FYI If you think the idea of a 36 foot plus alligator is impossible there is a fossil skull on display in the American Museum of Natural History in New York of an extinct crocodile. The skull is over five feet long. Image that such monsters once did roam the earth!".

The reason is that its both sharply witty and frightening at the same time which is a hard thing to achieve. The acting is good with Robert Forster ringing the alarm bells about an oversized gator living in the sewers. Our poor old gator was flushed down a toilet as a baby you'd be a bit mad too... and after feasting on some dumped lab animals grows to over 30 feet and is ready for some human munchies. As for the effects they're done really well. Direction is very good and the script is way above average for this type of fare. TTKK's Bottomline  Alligator does for swimming pools and suburbia what Jaws done for the beach. Highly recommended for those looking for aquatic thrills.".

John Sayles' sharp script Craig Hundley's chilling soundtrack and a sidesplitting performance from Henry Silva as sweet talker Col. Brock are just some of the wonders of this film. Alligator also benefits form being as hilarious as it is suspenseful with one particular involving a kid's party the alligator in the pool and a prank gone horribly wrong. As far as I know this was the first monster movie to the have the now cliqued ending of the baby monster being born before the credits roll. As a matter of fact Aliigator remains one of the few Jaws inspired flicks to have a favorable response. Even the normally unfavorable Leonard Maltin awarded this movie a 34 and noted it for its good script and mix of Horror and Comedy. I am surprised though that the IMDb rating is only approx. 5.310. If you enjoy fun scary or funny movies watch this feature. If you enjoyed this movie vote and increase the IMDb rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "A certain old urban legend that you may have heard of brilliantly takes on a life of its own in this underrated horror classic. There were scores of these straighttovideo monster movies that were made in the eighties and early 90's and so many of them are so cheap and boring that they're barely memorable and you watch this film and every scene has got the genuine charm and really great dry wit the script is superb and the story terrificallypaced most genre movies these days would take forty minutes to cover the same amount of ground that this one does in a quarter of an hour. There's no bullst just flush boom and right into the action! To me it's just an extremely fun film to watch a throwback to an oldfashioned great Bmovie in the best sense of it. I think it looks very professional considering how old it is which you can tell but I really wish more films would have been made like this as I find its style more entertaining than most of the bigbudget Hollywood monster films. I don't deny that a couple of hundredthousand dollars more for special effects couldn't have hurt but I don't know if that would have made it a better picture in the long run or not. I personally love the effects there's a very effective mix of various practical effects and scenes where they'll have a real live juvenile gator crawling through a miniature set and even as a little kid I could tell that's what it was. But it just works the effect still looks pretty good whenever they show the victims trapped in the huge jaws of the scaly beast it looks real! The models look a little funky at times but they fit the picture and are used in a competent way that you buy into them. The sequence where I think they show way too much of the alligator is the big crazy wedding massacre which is too overthetop and silly for me now with the ridiculously obvious looped screaming in the background and oh no not the wedding cake! And how long does it take for a crowd to clear one party? Apart from that I'm glad they don't show the creature all that much. I find it far more frightening and sinister when it's mostly unseen and lurking in the dank darkness of the sewers... The parts of this movie that I enjoy the most are all the sewer scenes they're so fantastically creepy and atmospheric it makes me uncomfortable just watching those scenes! They combine the fear of water and the dark. Anyway less is often more when it comes to practical effect monsters. No matter how good a beastie they created the more it's seen the less effective and interesting it becomes. You start to say oh look how well designed and animated it is but you're not afraid of it anymore you become accustomed to it. When you look at something like Alien where you never really see the monster that's really scary and fun. I think about this movie and others like it from the time that again a lot of them are far more entertaining than flicks like the 1998 Godzilla say because it's about characterthen humour then the horror. It's not all about the special effects and that's what makes this film endure where other films where they did all the perfectly planned special effects they're soulless vacant kind of movies and this one still really holds up. Especially when it comes to the characters. Robert Forster's burnedout performance delivers such a perfectly jaded wellrounded likable gruff hero that you really want to see win and kick that gator's ass! His kind of deadpan delivery was so spot on. And Robin Riker's nerdy yet sexy cool and collected reptile expert who still lives with her mother is also solid. I found their romantic chemistry virtually nonexistent but they still made a great team together. I just loved the lively old gal that played Marissa's mother! She was so natural it wasn't even like it was acting it was like the nicest lady ever what'd they catch her on a coffee break and stick her in front of the camera? And also the tobaccochewing Perry Lang was witty and gorgeous.. The picture basically exists to me as a horror thriller with overtones of comedy brought out by the characterisations. It just had comedic aspects to it but never goes into downright parody. There's such a great balance between the horror and the humour. I find the scene where the little boy is made to walk the plank and is devoured very grim and disturbing. The way the mother turns on the light and reveals the hungry maw of the gator just as he's being pushed in it's totally the stuff that nightmares are made of. And that was damn ballsy at the time daring to kill a kid. Hell even Friday the 13th had Jason spare a little girl! All you see is a cloud of blood but it's still a horrific shock moment that's very memorable. I also loved the moment during the creepy sequence where Madison and Kelly are searching the sewers and when the torch shines behind them you catch a glimpse of the alligator for a second as it stealthily moves back and the light reflects off its eye and it's one of the film's eeriest moments and a very effective use of lighting effects. The movie is also aided by a fantastic score that does a great job of accentuating the fun yet scary tone I find the theme that plays over the end credits seriously chilling. It's a monster movie that knows what it is and has fun with it. Always a true pleasure to watch again and again. Bless you Alligator!!!".

We can thank screenwriter John Sayles then a writer for hire his other genre credits during the period being Piranha and The Howling for its wit and ambition and Lewis Teague Cujo Cat's Eye for the efficient righttothepoint direction and genuine thrills.It exploits the old urban legend of alligators in the sewers for maximum entertainment telling the tale of a gator named Ramon flushed down the drain as an infant and making its home in the Chicago sewer. It grows to mammoth proportions after having feasted on dead dogs that had been injected with a growth hormone by a dubious pharmaceutical company. It's up to dedicated police detective David Madison the likable Robert Forster in a perfect Everyman role to find and destroy the outofcontrol beast when other attempts by the police prove to be unsuccessful.Sayles shows here that the trend of referencing bits of pop culture most assuredly did not begin with Scream as here he makes jokes referring to Ed Norton the character on 'The Honeymooners' who worked for the sewer department and Orson Welles's character from the classic The Third Man. He gets some great chuckles from some of his lines and also adding to the humour is the performance of Henry Silva as an egomaniacal big game hunter. Adding sex appeal is husky voiced redhead Robin Riker as the movies' reptile expert. A wonderful supporting cast includes swaggering Dean Jagger as the corporate creep Bart Braverman as the pesky reporter Perry Lang as an eager beaver young cop original Lolita Sue Lyon as a TV reporter Sydney Lassick as a pet store owner Jack Carter as the sleazy mayor and the hilarious raspy voiced Michael Gazzo as Madisons' boss on the police force. Other familiar faces in small roles include Angel Tompkins Royce D. Applegate Simmy Bow Stan Haze Micole Mercurio John Goff and Mike Mazurki.Among the touches Sayles and Teague bring to the material are the idea of the gator eating its way up the socioeconomic ladder heading for the man who created it in the first place and a willingness to treat many characters as fair game even children. The sequence where the gator brought to life by more convincing special effects than usual first emerges into the outside world is a corker as is the big set piece where it runs amok at a wedding there are some amazing stunts during this sequence. The pacing never flags and Forster and Riker are an endearing main couple he plays exactly the kind of hero for whom WANTS to root.Any monster movie fan tired of the routine cheese fests featuring animated creatures that come out nowadays is strongly encouraged to check out this solidly entertaining little flick. They won't be disappointed.Followed 11 years later by a sequel.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Owes much to Jaws but it has a certain spark of its own";
	schema:reviewBody "Alligator is yet another creature feature that has its root in Jaws but it is certainly not a blatant rip off. It is ridiculous but in a selfacknowledging way. Taking itself seriously is the mistake that Orca the first Jaws rip off in '77 made. and although I can't say that it Alligator is necessarily more intelligent the script it offers frequent enjoyable banner and an attempt to make characters that you want to see live rather than become lunch. Topping all that Alligator features one of the most frequent trade marks of the genre an ending that opens the doors for a potentially worse sequel. It is something that seeming fly cannot be helped even Jaws went that way. Sequel or not check out Alligator if you can it is better than it may sound.In the beginning a girl buys a baby alligator at the zoo well her mother buys it for her. She names it Ramona after the Beverly Cleary books but that is irrelevant sorry. Next scene her father in a moment of frustration takes his anger out on the six inch reptile and flushes it down the toilet to its doom actually to its growth spurt Jump forward twenty years and into the life of detective David Madison. He and his parter have begun an investigation of a possible illegal animal experimentation in a local facility. Their search for the bodies takes them into the sewers. Madison's parter meets his end and it doesn't take long before the creature manages to break out. All of a sudden the city becomes the site of an enormous 'bughunt' for a forty foot eating machine. Nobody really knows what to do except for Madison and his new girlfriend who is a reptilian specialist.Let me now point out right now that the most important trick to shooting a convincing monster regardless of how much money you spend on effects is choosing your camera angles. This is something that Alligator does quite well. The beast doesn't look like a giant fabricated puppet it looks like a scaly fleshy reptile actually sometimes it is. A number of wide shots were done with miniature sets and a juvenile gator about a meter in length. Something else worth noting about Alligator which helps is that the plot not only acknowledges its absurdity but it tries to build on that with a certain sense of humor although Lake Placid did this a little better. Sometimes however it gets a bit too absurd. One scene in particular is especially ridiculous. Around the  point the gator crashes a garden party and kills about twenty people. When I say kills I don't just mean kills and eats I mean that it kills. The way the creature chomps on one person drops him in a puddle of blood and moves onto another person is scientifically incorrect. Also the way it flattens a limo with its tail is even more ridiculous considering the shape of its backbone. Then again to be fair Jaws also had its share of scientific inaccuracies.Alligator does what it intends to do which is offer campy fun in Jaws tradition. Considering what has come out since the film actually works even better. From the bowels of the city to the bowels of a giant reptilians digestive track Alligator is weirdquirky and occasionally bloody ride which will sustain viewers for a good hour and a half. That for me would be considered a success.".

Taking itself seriously is the mistake that Orca the first Jaws rip off in '77 made. and although I can't say that it Alligator is necessarily more intelligent the script it offers frequent enjoyable banner and an attempt to make characters that you want to see live rather than become lunch. Topping all that Alligator features one of the most frequent trade marks of the genre an ending that opens the doors for a potentially worse sequel. It is something that seeming fly cannot be helped even Jaws went that way. Sequel or not check out Alligator if you can it is better than it may sound.In the beginning a girl buys a baby alligator at the zoo well her mother buys it for her. She names it Ramona after the Beverly Cleary books but that is irrelevant sorry. Next scene her father in a moment of frustration takes his anger out on the six inch reptile and flushes it down the toilet to its doom actually to its growth spurt Jump forward twenty years and into the life of detective David Madison. He and his parter have begun an investigation of a possible illegal animal experimentation in a local facility. Their search for the bodies takes them into the sewers. Madison's parter meets his end and it doesn't take long before the creature manages to break out. All of a sudden the city becomes the site of an enormous 'bughunt' for a forty foot eating machine.

Not because of the complexity of the stories intertwined through the film but because of the sheer emotional impact virtually every scene carries with it.I won't go into details about the three stories but I can say that above all else DOLLS is a lesson in love and anguish and it is by far Kitano's most powerful work even more so than Hanabi.I'm baffled by the negative reviews I've seen of this film since it was first aired.  I wonder if it might be a case of the viewer needing to understand the way Japanese often tend to act and feel when faced with difficult or unbearable situations and without that understanding you might question if people would ever really act the way they do in DOLLS.  The answer is that often they really do.I've considered Kitano a master film maker for a long time now.  The man has only ever made one film that can't be considered good the embarrassingly poor Getting Any? and I consider Hanabi in particular to be one of the finest films ever made.  But Dolls almost functions at another level.  I don't know how often I will watch it because it genuinely is emotionally draining but this is simply a brilliant piece of film making.  The cinematography is exquisite.  The acting is fantastic especially Miho Kanno who gives such a tragic beautiful performance while hardly saying a world throughout the film.  And above all the emotional bond forged with the viewer is beyond any I think I've ever seen on film.Anyone who truly loves film should see Dolls.  Actors should see Dolls if only to see how little you really need to give in order to portray real emotion.  Directors should see Dolls and learn from a master.

The point to criticize the movie for most of the critics is the point that I praise the use of the symbols is 100 aesthetic I even believe that the real love is not the subject of the movie but aesthetics and the greatest of everything is that using this strange way of filming he really emphasizes the story. The traditional filming would use symbol's as a way to directly emphasize the action but this movie uses the symbols independently from the action and that gives strength to the overall story.The aestheticism is very dangerous because it can turn your movie into a sum of meaningless scenes attached with a very poor story making it very boring. However Kitanosensei my biggest and greatest inspiration manages to exploit aesthetics without loosing the plot.This is not the first time that Kitano tries to explain a story with images in Ano natsu ichiban shizukana umi A scene at the sea tried something similar but didn't fully succeed.In conclusion it's a masterpiece you shouldn't forget.

	schema:headline " Too much thinking?Dolls not just aesthetics";
	schema:reviewBody "Praising or dismissing Dolls as pure aesthetics is just a banal way of labeling something that is beautiful which does not lend itself to immediate understanding.  Just because any number of the meanings of the film don't jump out and bite the viewer is no reason to dismiss it as only aesthetically pleasing.  We've got plenty of nature scenes and people starring blankly into space in cinema.  They are not all masterpieces and Dolls would not be even half decent if that's all it was. If you feel the need to like this movie then a better expression of this feeling is need than saying It's purdy.As for myself I found there we several themes running through the film that merit investigation.  First of all the idea of hierarchy in relationships. In all the relationship there was a clearly dominant partner yakuza popstar groom and a clear subservient partner lady on bench fan discarder girlfriend.  At the beginning of the film their supremacy is flaunted.  They come and go as they please and treat the other member of the relationship flippantly and with little regard.  They believe themselves to be the more powerful person in the relationship and think they are not as dependent on the socalled weaker member as the weaker member is on them. So times passes some strange occurrences take place and whom do these people come back to?  Who are the most important people in their lives? Those weaker partners.  In the end they and we realize that the stronger or more assertive member in a relationship is just as dependent on the weaker member as the weaker is on the strong.  In this context they are seen as both playing roles essential to the relationship the fact that one is more forceful than the other does not undermine the importance of the less assertive persons role. Of course this is not to be taken literally and applied to all relationships but it is a comment on or investigation of the idea of stronger and weaker partners in a relationship.  The ultimate conclusion is a deconstruction of the hierarchy that shows the partners to be equal or at least codependent.The next question is Why were all of these relationships unsuccessful? My ascertation is that this plays into the strict nature of Japanese culture and Kitano's own morose sense of destiny seen most vividly in Sonatine. All the male characters make major life mistakes in the film.  They attempt to rectify them by seeking comfort in the person they have wronged or in the case of the blind man in the person with the closest connection.  Why are they not allowed to start again?  Why do they all fail?  So many films are about starting over that it's never too late to turn over a new leaf old dogs can learn new tricks etc etc. While I'm quite glad this is not the story of a spunky middleaged former soccer mom who finds true love the second time around I don't see the point in the absolute negation of the power of reconciliation. You'll have to ask Kitano about all that.  I'm no Japanese cultural expert though I have been there but this seems to fall in line with the rather strict and unforgiving personality of Japanese society.  If you've made a major mistake you have to accept it and take all the consequences willingly and bow to whatever your fate may be in response to those consequences.  Kitano seems to embrace this idea of not being able to escape destiny in many films I already mentioned Sonatine as a particularly poignant example of this.I still think the Hanabai is Kitanos best work although watching a bunch of psychotic Japanese people run into walls and fall flailing into moats on Takeshis Castle is good too.  Dolls is interesting worth a look and still better than 99 of films out there.".

	onyx:emotionText "Praising or dismissing Dolls as pure aesthetics is just a banal way of labeling something that is beautiful which does not lend itself to immediate understanding.  Just because any number of the meanings of the film don't jump out and bite the viewer is no reason to dismiss it as only aesthetically pleasing.  We've got plenty of nature scenes and people starring blankly into space in cinema.  They are not all masterpieces and Dolls would not be even half decent if that's all it was. If you feel the need to like this movie then a better expression of this feeling is need than saying It's purdy.As for myself I found there we several themes running through the film that merit investigation.  First of all the idea of hierarchy in relationships. In all the relationship there was a clearly dominant partner yakuza popstar groom and a clear subservient partner lady on bench fan discarder girlfriend.  At the beginning of the film their supremacy is flaunted.  They come and go as they please and treat the other member of the relationship flippantly and with little regard.  They believe themselves to be the more powerful person in the relationship and think they are not as dependent on the socalled weaker member as the weaker member is on them.

You may recognize elements borrowed from traditional legends Oedipus Arabian Nights etc however the central theme is as far as I know an original. It is the story of the leashed beggars who are introduced in the beginning and whose story unfolds in a challenging nonlinear way as the film progresses.I call it challenging because the viewer is compelled to pay attention to every detail in order to realize the plot and sublime theme. In that respect it is much like Citizen Kane told in fragments which the viewer must assemble and interpret. The underlying philosophy is yet more elusive and will have you debating for days afterward.To me what made this film superior to Citizen Kane through no fault of Orson Welles! is the extreme use of colors and vivid scenery. The stunning backgrounds become a silent character in the movie filling in for the sparse dialogue and periodic silence. As we evolve through Spring Summer Autumn and Winter the saying comes to mind a picture is worth a thousand words. If this review makes sense to you then you will not be disappointed!".

	schema:headline " A Kitano metamorphosis  new shape still to emerge";
	schema:reviewBody "spoilersIt will take more than a few paragraphs to study Takeshi Kitano and it will certainly take much more than an average moviegoer who just happens to have seen 7 out of the 10 films he directed up to Dolls he acted in a lot more. Still we can take a few paragraphs to try to look at Dolls to see where Kitano is going.It's not too difficult to come up with a list of things that are so characteristic in Kitano's films. These can go from one extreme of his brand of abrupt but not necessarily vicious violence to the other extreme of subtle unspoken tenderness. To some people it could be Kitano's unique sense of humour sometimes noire sometimes innocently playful. Still others may be struck by his frequent use of shots of characters in many cases played by himself that remain absolutely still with no facial expression whatsoever. There is also the consistent tone of tragedy. The list can go on and on.Inasmuch as he has kept mostly to his unique style Kitano has also tried things different most noticeably in his 8th film Kikujiro a lighthearted story of the relatioship between a man who is a bit of a rascal and a boy under the popular highway movie formula. Conspicuously missing the usual violence or tragic tone in Kitano's films Kikujiro is mildly sentimental with considerable satire on the central character played by himself and reflecting some say much of himself. While I think that Hanabi Fireworks in the traditional Kitano genre is still his best work todate Kikujiro has had considerable success in trying something new and different. Dolls is a new attempt at the same thing. It is easy to agree that many of the traditional Kitano elements are no longer found in Dolls. It's harder to agree on what is new and for what purpose.People talk about Dolls as three stories. It is not entirely so at least not in the sense of Amores Perrors 2000 a brilliant Mexican film in which a car accident is used to connect three beautifully interwoven stories that are well balanced. In Dolls the main story of Sawako and Matsumoto dominates. The episode of the pop singer disgifured in a car accident is only a brief interlude. The third story about the yakuza boss has a little more background but is still too scanty to be considered a parallel story. The connections between the three stories are quite haphazard.A frequently applied angle in looking at Dolls is its beautiful cinematography simply in terms of Kitano's desire to show the natural beauty of Japan in the four seasons. That Kitano loves to shoot the beauty of the sea is well know to followers of his work. It is not unreasonable to assume that he has gone further in that direction to try to shoot a film of cinematography splendour. But I do not totally agree. While I won't go to the extent of saying that pursuit of aesthetics in Dolls is purely incidental I think it's only a small part. I would even venture to say although many would undoubtedly disagree that these beautiful scenes were put in there as an afterthought. Without undermining the cinematography achievement in Dolls I would say that such achievements are not particularly outstanding in comparison to many other films. For the best one would still have to go back to the likes of David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia.Also frequently mentioned is Dolls' obvious theme of absolute devotion. Such emotions in Doll however are onedimensional. The pop fan's expression of devotion towards the disfigured idol will more likely bring a shudder than a sigh. The woman's weekly bento box for the yakuza boss may elicit for her some pity which however would be more for a mentally imbalanced person than for a devoted lover. Even Matsumoto's devotion to Sawako stemmed from his having gone astray in the first place. From Dolls the audience does not get the depth and warmth of resonance as in Hanabi from detective Nishi's feeling towards his terminally ill wife and disabled partner.One thing I particularly notice is the gradual evolution of Sawako's physical movement as the mystical journey progresses from that of a disoriented mental patient to that of a Bunraku puppet. How deliberate this transformation is I cannot tell. But this does seem consistent with the refrain of the Bunraku scene at the end and the ultimate fate of the couple. The tragic end does follow Kitano's tradition but here at least is some joy in seeing Sawako's memory revived from being brought to the scene of her original wedding engagement with Matsumoto. The interpretation of the Bunraku metaphor however is left to the audiences' imagination.Artists may not always on a conscious level be fully aware of what are the motivations and ultimate objectives of their creation. In the case of Dolls it may well be that from a spontaneous inspiration by the Bunraku theatre an idea gave birth to a project and the film simply evolved as things moved along. After all even Tolkien confessed that Lord of the Rings originated from a much humbler endeavour in a children's story The Hobbits and ...the story grew in the telling as he said.Often quoted is Kitano's own remark that Dolls is his most violent film. The obvious interpretation of this is that while there is clearly less visual graphic violence the emotional violence in the name of devotion surpasses everything we have seen before in Kitano's films. But Kitano could be making this remark simply to provoke reactions to initiate debates.In conclusion and also as a possible alternative summary line Is there really a need to explain everything? Could we not see Dolls simply an another experiment of Kitano at creating something new and different?".

The list can go on and on.Inasmuch as he has kept mostly to his unique style Kitano has also tried things different most noticeably in his 8th film Kikujiro a lighthearted story of the relatioship between a man who is a bit of a rascal and a boy under the popular highway movie formula. Conspicuously missing the usual violence or tragic tone in Kitano's films Kikujiro is mildly sentimental with considerable satire on the central character played by himself and reflecting some say much of himself. While I think that Hanabi Fireworks in the traditional Kitano genre is still his best work todate Kikujiro has had considerable success in trying something new and different. Dolls is a new attempt at the same thing. It is easy to agree that many of the traditional Kitano elements are no longer found in Dolls. It's harder to agree on what is new and for what purpose.People talk about Dolls as three stories. It is not entirely so at least not in the sense of Amores Perrors 2000 a brilliant Mexican film in which a car accident is used to connect three beautifully interwoven stories that are well balanced. In Dolls the main story of Sawako and Matsumoto dominates. The episode of the pop singer disgifured in a car accident is only a brief interlude. The third story about the yakuza boss has a little more background but is still too scanty to be considered a parallel story. The connections between the three stories are quite haphazard.A frequently applied angle in looking at Dolls is its beautiful cinematography simply in terms of Kitano's desire to show the natural beauty of Japan in the four seasons. That Kitano loves to shoot the beauty of the sea is well know to followers of his work. It is not unreasonable to assume that he has gone further in that direction to try to shoot a film of cinematography splendour. But I do not totally agree. While I won't go to the extent of saying that pursuit of aesthetics in Dolls is purely incidental I think it's only a small part. I would even venture to say although many would undoubtedly disagree that these beautiful scenes were put in there as an afterthought. Without undermining the cinematography achievement in Dolls I would say that such achievements are not particularly outstanding in comparison to many other films. For the best one would still have to go back to the likes of David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia.Also frequently mentioned is Dolls' obvious theme of absolute devotion. Such emotions in Doll however are onedimensional. The pop fan's expression of devotion towards the disfigured idol will more likely bring a shudder than a sigh. The woman's weekly bento box for the yakuza boss may elicit for her some pity which however would be more for a mentally imbalanced person than for a devoted lover. Even Matsumoto's devotion to Sawako stemmed from his having gone astray in the first place. From Dolls the audience does not get the depth and warmth of resonance as in Hanabi from detective Nishi's feeling towards his terminally ill wife and disabled partner.One thing I particularly notice is the gradual evolution of Sawako's physical movement as the mystical journey progresses from that of a disoriented mental patient to that of a Bunraku puppet. How deliberate this transformation is I cannot tell. But this does seem consistent with the refrain of the Bunraku scene at the end and the ultimate fate of the couple. The tragic end does follow Kitano's tradition but here at least is some joy in seeing Sawako's memory revived from being brought to the scene of her original wedding engagement with Matsumoto. The interpretation of the Bunraku metaphor however is left to the audiences' imagination.Artists may not always on a conscious level be fully aware of what are the motivations and ultimate objectives of their creation. In the case of Dolls it may well be that from a spontaneous inspiration by the Bunraku theatre an idea gave birth to a project and the film simply evolved as things moved along. After all even Tolkien confessed that Lord of the Rings originated from a much humbler endeavour in a children's story The Hobbits and ...the story grew in the telling as he said.Often quoted is Kitano's own remark that Dolls is his most violent film. The obvious interpretation of this is that while there is clearly less visual graphic violence the emotional violence in the name of devotion surpasses everything we have seen before in Kitano's films. But Kitano could be making this remark simply to provoke reactions to initiate debates.In conclusion and also as a possible alternative summary line Is there really a need to explain everything? Could we not see Dolls simply an another experiment of Kitano at creating something new and different?";

	schema:reviewBody "A passing knowledge of Bunraku the Japanese traditional art of stage puppetry and some familiarity with the work of seventeenth century Japanese dramatist Monzaemon Chikamatsu may help nonpointy headed viewers appreciate the themes of love suicide social pressure and tragedy in Takeshi Kitano's visually enchanting film Dolls. Three intertwined stories of obsessional love are thematically influenced by Chikamatsu the Japanese Shakespeare whose dramas are still acted out by Bunraku puppeteers and remain hugely resonant even in modern Japan.In the first story a man pressured by his parents into marrying the daughter of his boss devotes his life to the lover he spurned after learning that she has attempted suicide. The two now bound together literally wander through Japan in a surreal journey that covers all four seasons. The following stories feature a Yakuza boss who seeks out the lover he abandoned decades earlier and a devoted but disturbed fan who takes an extraordinary course of action to meet with the pop star he idolises after she has been disfigured in a car crash.Dolls marks a new departure in style and subject for Takeshi whose past work has focused mainly on the violent world of the Yakuza and is marked by its distinct greyblue visual style. To counter this muted look Takeshi consciously sought to add colour to Dolls and this he does to stunning effect. With the help of his friend fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto and cinematographer Katsumi Yanagishima Takeshi has achieved a lush sensuous aesthetic that at times can be quite sublime.Many of Chikamatsu's plays were written for performance in Bunraku and Takeshi has given the film a stage like quality  he sees the characters as living dolls and allusions are made to this throughout the film. All this leads to the inevitable question of does it work? The answer unfortunately is no. Takeshi's characters are not sufficiently developed or emotionally involving enough for us to care about them. This is especially the case with the bound lovers Sawako and Matsumoto Miho Kanno and Hidetoshi Nishijima whose subdued and emotionless performance alienates the audience.Sawako and Matsumoto were based on two real life 'bound' beggars who Takeshi would often see in his Tokyo suburb. The reason that these beggars were bound to each other we'll more than likely never know but in the case of the lovers an old Japanese saying about betrothed couples being bound by the red strings of fate seems to apply. This is all very interesting but sadly Dolls is not. The film pretty as it is falls a bit flat due to its poor character development and meandering story line. This is no problem for Takeshi though who has stated that he will be happy if viewers are simply amazed at the beautiful pictures. I suspect that with the majority of viewers this will be the case.".

There is an unreal fairytale feel to the proceedings that creates a pervasive air of mystery. The film is powerful in a strangely lowkey way and its narrative flexibility defies explanation while leaving itself open to many different interpretations.

	schema:reviewBody "A filmmaker friend and fellow has recommended I watch this film. I have never seen any of previous works of Takeshi Ketano before however heard about him plenty. Let me tell you what a journey this movie has been for me.First of all everyone speaks of the aesthetics of DOLLS which I completely agree with. The movie is perfectly crafted even though at times it seems like a cat jumped on the AVID keyboard and created a few jump cuts by an accident which was really cool. Obviously under Ketano's precise eye nothing is a mistake.The visuals of this film tell the story not the words. Its a first film of a kind where you can completely shut the sound off and get the story nonetheless. With an amazing craft Kitano explores silence by that focusing your attention into whats on the canvas. At times you can freeze frame and just look at the picture as if its a painting. Kitano goes into an exploration of human psyche on such deep levels that sometimes I felt like I was finding out new things about myself. Choosing themes carefully he delivers a story about human beings and their emotions and what these emotions do to the human beings. At times looking at us as if we are microbes under Kitano's cameraeasque eye of a microscope he adds elements into life as if on Petri's dish and sees what grows out of it knowing that some microbes won't stand the chance of surviving the newly added obstacles.Just like Japanese poetry the movie doesn't make sense at times and yet remains purely a joy of a visual sight. Also I was truly touched and amazed by the connection with the color red. He connects to the meaning of the rope which is limitation and humiliation and by coloring other objects in red he suggests that those elements are a rope to some of the characters just the same. The lady who waits for her boyfriend to come back wears a red hat and she is bound to waiting for him forever. Also the red takes over the character of the mute girlfriend of the main character and eventually she all dresses in red by that becoming even more of a DOLL than she was before. She surrenders herself to the slavery of the rope and it grows into her.In the end I think this movie is not about one thing in particular but more of a David Lynch approach to storytelling. Its in the abstract formulas which you can not comprehend fully but certainly get the idea. Its in the depth of our minds where the subconscious would have to translate the pictures we see into personal meanings to ourselves.DOLLS is an intellectual paradigm a true cinema a MUST to watch.Thank you Tony for your wonderful suggestion! 910".

This film intertwines three stories inspired by Bunraku traditional japanese marionette's theatre. It should be an ode to eternal love and its overwhelming importance over success in life but it fails because of Kitano's poetic narrative style. Dolls finally provides only a slight amount of supposed to be beautiful images stunning colors cheap symbolisms and nothing more. We are in Japan so there are also cherry blossoms almonds in flower and snowy mountains like in the most banal segments of Akira Kurosawa's Dreams. It seems that too many awards in western film festivals deprived Kitano of his dry cruel humour and gave him in change the sloppy sugary look at life we saw in Brother already. Unlike Silence at the sea and HanaBi Dolls lacks that laconic  and unsentimental way of depicting feelings which was one of Kitano' trademarks. Acclaimed as one the most original authors of the earliest nineties after receiving the Leone d'oro for HanaBi Kitano started releasing films which seem unintentional spoofs of his previous works he's maybe becoming that kind of director who is not satisfied with making films he wants to deliver some true art. Arty must be the most appropriate word for this misfire. Boring is the second most appropriate. I gave it 510 only because I don't want to inflict a too low rate on a such a great director's film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Strange and far from perfect but an amazing cinematic experience. Takeshi Kitano is best known for his yakuza films but with Dolls and Zatoichi I think he's moved beyond and become a more wellrounded artist. Dolls is a highly aestheticized film that intertwines three stories about undying insanitycausing love. The structure is very strange and it doesn't work perfectly. One story the most effective one in my mind about a man who tethers himself to his braindamaged exfiance takes up the most screen time. However most of that screen time is devoted just to watching the two stumble solemnly through the seasons of the year. It becomes quite poetic and a good excuse for creating gorgeous visual compositions. The other two stories take up relatively little screen time and feel more prosaic though with a definite tinge of myths. One involves a yakuza boss who nearing death visits a park bench where he used to meet his sweetheart when he was a young man  and finds her still waiting for him. The third tale involves a man who is obsessed with a pop star. When she is injured in a car accident he is not allowed to see her disfigured face. So he removes his own eyes in order to spend time with her. The secondary stories are far less satisfying than the tale of bound beggars but the three stories do meld into a very satisfying whole. The film also seems to hint at more and a second viewing might tie everything together much for satisfactorily. It's visual beauty is only surpassed by its highly advanced editing rhythms and perhaps also its exquisite score by Jo Hisaishi frequent collaborator of Hayao Miyazaki.".

Above all it is love which pushes every acting person choice however is the tricky momentum in the film. Every character has hisher life with its own background. At one point in their lives something changes as it is due to an attempt of suicide or an car accident. No matter if being involved directly or indirectly the characters happen to find themselves at a point where they have to choose. Three storylines three pairs of people and always one of the two decides to choose love. Kitano shows impressively how strong the bond between two human beings can be. This bond is visually shown by an actual rope between the two main characters. However as the title Dolls anticipates the story follows the guide given in form of a traditional dollsplay in the beginning. In my opinion it is as if every character is just a doll driven by hisher emotion and that choice might be an illusion in the end.

	schema:headline " Without question one of Bergman's most intense and unforgettable films";
	schema:reviewBody "This is without question one of Bergman's greatest and most rewarding films and indeed one of his most subtle. Like his more iconic work  such as The Seventh Seal 1957 Wild Strawberries 1957 Persona 1966 Cries and Whispers 1971 etc  it presents a rich tapestry of wounded characters and painful memories that are affective on a completely external level. However what elevates this from a great film to a work of unforgettable genius is in the questions that the film asks  but never answers  and in the window that it offers into the world of Bergman's previous film the surreal antiwar parable Shame 1968.Like many of his greatest films A Passion 1969 looks at characters disconnected from the world in which they inhabit and slowly becoming disconnected from themselves within the process. There are the obvious parallels with Shame  which we will come back to  as well as Persona 1966 and Hour of the Wolf 1966. As with those films A Passion has strong roots in existentialism creating a barren landscape that comes to represent the internal psychological state of the characters and that particular sense of deep despair and quiet alienation that drives them to take solace in other equally damaged souls. We also have a series of continual stylistic juxtapositions and attempts by Bergman to disarm and distract us. The most obvious of these is the use of the narration which on our first exposure seems to fulfil no real purpose instead merely jarring against the natural almostdocumentary like presentation of the film. Added to this there is a subtle breakdown in reality happening with the notions of fact and fiction which is again mirrored externally by the way in which Bergman breaks the fourthwall of the drama to offer us the opinions of his actors on the roles that they are about to perform.The technique is reminiscent of Toshio Matsumoto's equally compelling psychological examination Funeral Parade of Roses 1969 only without the obvious kaleidoscopic influences of pop art psychedelic rock and the spirit of Jean Luc Godard. It also suggests the confessional element of films like Hour of the Wolf Scenes from a Marriage 1973 and Rite 1969 only in a way that is far more obtrusive. What these scenes represent for me at this exact point in time is somewhat unknown although they certainly don't feel out of place especially within the context of that closing shot and the final revelation.The plot here is a maze of pure emotions with Bergman's cold and clinical narration and ironic deconstruction of the narrative elements turning A Passion into an examination with characters trapped in metaphorical glass jars and analysed by spectators in order to understand something not necessarily about the characters but very much about ourselves. Alongside these deconstructive elements we have characters that seemingly can't be trusted with the information that they have to offer us with lies guilt and deceit all swirling 'round us like a whirlpool of blame disappointment and critical selfexamination. The characters are running away from things that there is no real escape from and the relationship that seems to offer a further window out of their selfimposed exile and malaise ends up leading back again leaving the characters broken more so than they were at the start of the film. Although it is done subtly by Bergman the ending of the film is every bit as desolate and apocalyptic as the ending of Shame or as deconstructive and subversive as the ending of Persona.Alongside the creation of a setting that is barren and desolate and the claustrophobic feeling created by the use of cramped interiors and a limited psychological space Bergman also creates tension from the enigmatic quality of his characters and the questions that they present. In one of the film's most fascinating subplots we discover that the animals on the island are being slaughtered by an unseen madman an intelligent and disturbing idea that further suggests the notions of reality breaking down and the nightmarish thoughts and feelings of the characters spilling out and enveloping them. The identity of this violent and cruel individual remains a mystery throughout with Bergman leaving us to draw our own conclusions forcing the audience to question not only the actions and intentions of the character observing this horror but also whether or not this same horror is merely an extension of the character's crumbling world. This is further illustrated by a thirdact dream sequence that not only contextualises the whole of A Passion  and in particular the character of Anna  but also the director's previous film Shame.Without a doubt this is raw and extremely powerful filmmaking evident from Bergman's uncomplicated use of editing and cinematography. As a result the film looks and feels very much like an obvious precursor to Lars von Trier's later examination into human fragility Breaking the Waves 1996 with the filmmaker shooting in muted colours with naturalistic lighting minimal production design choppy editing and the use of handheld cameras. This combined with the towering performance from Max Von Sydow as the central character Andreas Winkelman and fine support from Bergman's greatest collaborators Liv Ullmann Bibi Andersson and Erland Josephson create something truly astounding and truly unforgettable.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is without question one of Bergman's greatest and most rewarding films and indeed one of his most subtle. Like his more iconic work  such as The Seventh Seal 1957 Wild Strawberries 1957 Persona 1966 Cries and Whispers 1971 etc  it presents a rich tapestry of wounded characters and painful memories that are affective on a completely external level. However what elevates this from a great film to a work of unforgettable genius is in the questions that the film asks  but never answers  and in the window that it offers into the world of Bergman's previous film the surreal antiwar parable Shame 1968.Like many of his greatest films A Passion 1969 looks at characters disconnected from the world in which they inhabit and slowly becoming disconnected from themselves within the process. There are the obvious parallels with Shame  which we will come back to  as well as Persona 1966 and Hour of the Wolf 1966. As with those films A Passion has strong roots in existentialism creating a barren landscape that comes to represent the internal psychological state of the characters and that particular sense of deep despair and quiet alienation that drives them to take solace in other equally damaged souls. We also have a series of continual stylistic juxtapositions and attempts by Bergman to disarm and distract us. The most obvious of these is the use of the narration which on our first exposure seems to fulfil no real purpose instead merely jarring against the natural almostdocumentary like presentation of the film.

I picked this movie off the shelf just as I could have picked any other of his movies and since I haven't seen others I wouldn't know how to compare this to the rest of his work.But I liked it I really liked it.  I didn't find it as 'slow' as much as 'focused' where even the twitch of an eyebrow or a glance to the left is an action.  This minuteness was truly amazing.  In a lot of ways it reminded me of Bresson's Journal of a Country Priest. Because of this minuteness I also found it very cruel and raw.  I am particularly thinking of the scenes with the animals not only the sheep but the dog as well and especially the bird.And I have to say something about the colors.  They were amazing so warm and so different from the narration which was in itself detached and indifferent maybe 'disinterested' is a better word.  The light was amazing like what seemed like an eternal sunset when Eva and Andreas have dinner. If this were a painting I suppose it would be realist or naturalist work but the way the interviews cut in make it hyperrealist.  Other reviewers have criticized this but I found it as adding depth to the characters because it gave them a new real life.The English title is misleading though because it forces the viewer to focus on Anna whereas the original title doesn't do that.  I found myself waiting for things to happen to Anna until I found out that there was no reason for that to happen.  I am very happy to have seen this and will definitely not shy away from watching more Bergman movies.".

	schema:headline " A Bergman film not entirely sure of itself though never in perilous hands";
	schema:reviewBody "The Passion of Anna or The Passion as it might've been more appropriately titled in Sweden is Ingmar Bergman with a cast of some of his most recognizable faces Max Von Sydow Seventh Seal Liv Ullman Persona Erland Josephsson Scenes from a Marriage and Bibi Anderson Cries and Whispers  and with a script he's written that shows him not entirely sure or rather confident as he usually is as a filmmaker. He uses improvisation with his actors in some scenes experiments with what's in the story and what's outside of the story it's selfconscious but good selfconscious similar in tune with Persona's selfconsciousness of a film being made outside of what's in the story and deals away with his classic themes of despair selfdrought and innermaelstroms. And indeed the theme of deconstruction of the soul is in focus. For a couple of moments some of the selfconsciousness could come off as distracting or at most dangerous boring but there are counterweights to balance out whatever troubles Bergman must've had that he's pouring out onto the celluloid. While I thought the Passion of Anna wasn't one of Bergman's very best works it has a story and characters and with a cast that doesn't do wrong within any given scene that remain as potent as in his masterpieces. The subplot involving the slaying of the animals on the island maybe could've been developed more but that too brings a thoughtprovoking backbone to the central characters. At the core Bergman's presenting the audiences with people who are in a hellish situation with fires and blood being spread along the fields and that these people feel more or less stuck here. The relationship between Andreas Von Sydow and Anna Ullman is the strongest asset to the film and for their performances it's nearly worth it enough to rush out to buy the DVD. But beneath that this is a Bergman film that could grow on a particular viewer over time. Maybe upon a first viewing at least for what I came away with the style may be trying to oneup over the substance and that could be what hinders this from being a magnificent work of art on the level of Persona or The Seventh Seal. However it's also holds subtleties to the craft to the compositions by Sven Nykvist and in the emotions conveyed by the principles of the cast. Pretty haunting evocative though not entirely perfect this is definitely an intriguing Bergman entry. Grade strong A".

It's interesting that Verner writes to Andreas who seems to be the worst of all i.e. most unauthentic a suicide note saying I can't look into anyone's eyes anymore is to my understanding the key to the film  selfmade problems contrasted with problems created externally. Given Verner's suicide driven by slander and torture Andreas' and Anna's issues in their relationship fade normally but then an axe gets involved a stable burns down and a horse runs off ablazed kindled by the real animal tormentor who still is on the loose. An inferno.What I like most about this film though is its situational context the island. I can't think of another Bergman film where the environment plays a bigger role than here. All figures are moving in a lost iced vastness in defoliated sparse woods get stuck in morass and dirt. Animals get brutally tortured and killed wood gets chopped wagons bog down in mud. The forlornness and menace of the people in nature is wonderfully captured by Nykvist mostly in long highangle or panoramic shots and is an intriguing contrast to the interior of the cottages where the talking cheating and fighting takes place  inside there lurks the psychic outside there's the physical death. That is a great imagery.

	schema:reviewBody "Ingmar Bergman's 'The Passion Of Anna' seemed a masterpiece when I first saw it in 1969 in an art house cinema in London on my own. That intense experience overwhelmed me and has remained in my head although I have never seen it again until today. It is still powerful. The underlying menace metaphorically epitomised by animal abuses outside in grim weather is reflected by the inside scenes. Andreas a sophisticated 'outsider'  Max Von Sydow troubled by divorce no money and with a ravaged sense of failure and inadequacy  links up with a highly successful architect and his wife. The opening shot of Andreas on a rooftop ineffectually repairing some ridge tiles is a portent of his impracticality. The interiors are intimately photographed in dramatic contrast to the island shots where Nykvist gives us a broader view. There is a trapped sense of an intellectual but isolated group who can cope no better with life than the people who live permanently on the island. Bibi Andersson and Erland Josephson have their own conflicts and inner turmoils Erland plays Elis the architect and reveals the classic dilemma of the successful man. He has converted a windmill just to store his photographs. Hundreds of white boxes on shelves classified as emotions catastrophes violence they have no real purpose he says. He cannot allow his knowledge of human frailties to cloud his mind so he externalises his concerns storing them safely away. Andreas can only be a solitary part of their world and he tries to make something happen with Liv Ullman but that ends in bitterness. The players circle around each other all questing for something.

	onyx:emotionText "Ingmar Bergman's 'The Passion Of Anna' seemed a masterpiece when I first saw it in 1969 in an art house cinema in London on my own. That intense experience overwhelmed me and has remained in my head although I have never seen it again until today. It is still powerful. The underlying menace metaphorically epitomised by animal abuses outside in grim weather is reflected by the inside scenes. Andreas a sophisticated 'outsider'  Max Von Sydow troubled by divorce no money and with a ravaged sense of failure and inadequacy  links up with a highly successful architect and his wife. The opening shot of Andreas on a rooftop ineffectually repairing some ridge tiles is a portent of his impracticality. The interiors are intimately photographed in dramatic contrast to the island shots where Nykvist gives us a broader view. There is a trapped sense of an intellectual but isolated group who can cope no better with life than the people who live permanently on the island. Bibi Andersson and Erland Josephson have their own conflicts and inner turmoils Erland plays Elis the architect and reveals the classic dilemma of the successful man. He has converted a windmill just to store his photographs. Hundreds of white boxes on shelves classified as emotions catastrophes violence they have no real purpose he says. He cannot allow his knowledge of human frailties to cloud his mind so he externalises his concerns storing them safely away. Andreas can only be a solitary part of their world and he tries to make something happen with Liv Ullman but that ends in bitterness. The players circle around each other all questing for something. The arty inserts where interviews with the actors intrude on the narrative either irritates or helps at the time it seemed so innovative but I am now not so convinced it is a good idea. The film is still modern though. In the late 60s it seemed utterly new. The final scene is moving and unnerving.

Not only the characters but the filmmaker himself seems tired discouraged uncertain of what he wants to say.It's hard to be bored watching such fine actors work but the story they're acting doesn't add up to much. Lacking inspiration Bergman falls back on his customary verbosity and adds morbid touches such as the unpleasant scenes of animal cruelty here or Andreas and Anna watching on television a filmed execution in Viet Nam or somewhere that seem to have no purpose other than arousing revulsion in the viewer.Bergman's concentration on the cruel and the depressing almost to the exclusion of every other aspect of life must have seemed fresh and daring in the 1960s and 1970s but now he can seem almost adolescent in his obsession with the morbid. Samuel Beckett's plays chic during the same era have not dated well either. There's a lot more to life and to art than cruelty suffering and death but you'd never know it from Beckett or from Bergman films such as this one.In an interview excerpted in the special features Bergman says art must be useful otherwise we can all go to hell. It's very hard to say what the use of a film like this might be except to make audiences weary and depressed.Dark works which illuminate the human spirit can be valuable O'Neill's incredibly depressing but richly rewarding LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT is an example but sometimes Bergman seems to have had a contract to make a film and not a lot to say.

The film is obviously the work of a highly intelligent and talented writerfilmmaker but it never really pays off. Viewing it is sometimes painful sometimes boring but rarely illuminating.I feel the same way about CRIES AND WHISPERS an unpleasant and to my mind pointless film rated very highly by others. Both CRIES and ANNA are cruel films cold at the center. Bergman's lack of compassion seemed terribly modern honest and truthful in 1969 but now it looks more and more like a deficiency in the filmmaker's own sensibility.".

People who get especially upset at images of cruelty to animals might best keep away from this movie although those scenes are done very sensitively.The film is interspersed with post modernist vignettes by the main actors explaining how they feel about their characters.  While I found those scenes fascinating they did interrupt the flow a little and I found myself needing some time after each interruption to rejoin the lost and lonely world on that remote island.But the criticisms are minor.

This sequence is a bit confusing. When you think about it later you realize how it was incompletely prepared.More generally the movie  needed to fuse the 4 leads into the island life better. NonSwedes probably wont fully understand the quick rendering of the secondary characters.

The talent  involved in this production are almost  in a different league than everyone else in the history of the movie business. The acting is so good and the underlying concept so honest  that BergmanNyquist most times can just leave the camera on the actors in a way Hollywood productions can only dream about. And I say this as someone who does not usually like arthouse type movies.The concept is also original nonmisogynistically portraying a woman character as  possibly  an unconscious murderer as a liar who loves truth.... some of the sequences  are both cinematic and perfectly subtle in the Bergman style ...

The cinematography and direction are superb as are the haunting score and thoughtprovoking dialogue. The story I cannot praise enough the relationship between Andreas and Anna is one of the most intense and convincing of any film from Bergman's resume and while detached somewhat everything feels realistic and the intensity of the story and the relationship of the characters really drew me in. The characters are not likable in a way but what they are is compellingly real one of Bergman's greatest strengths in terms of characterisation was always his understanding of women and in my mind The Passion of Anna is one of the finest examples of that. The two lead performances are outstanding Max Von Sydow's facial expressions and eye contact always tell a lot and Liv Ullman's acting shows many complex emotions and seamlessly her beautiful eyes are also very expressive and telling.

	schema:reviewBody "A quite typical Ingmar Bergman film it is as powerfully acted and as well shot as one would expect however it otherwise fails to rise above the ordinary. The film has a unique unusual structure in which the story is broken up by interviews with the performers in which they discuss the characters that they are playing. While a rather interesting concept in itself it does not really work. It is clumsy way of getting across the emotions of the characters that are not obvious on screen and it does jar the flow of the story. The story itself is rather slim in content too and over one and a half hours in length is a stretch.

	onyx:emotionText "A quite typical Ingmar Bergman film it is as powerfully acted and as well shot as one would expect however it otherwise fails to rise above the ordinary. The film has a unique unusual structure in which the story is broken up by interviews with the performers in which they discuss the characters that they are playing. While a rather interesting concept in itself it does not really work. It is clumsy way of getting across the emotions of the characters that are not obvious on screen and it does jar the flow of the story. The story itself is rather slim in content too and over one and a half hours in length is a stretch. It is overly talkative and overall not one of Bergman's best films but Bergman still manages to end his film on a potent note plus the Sven Nykvist cinematography as well as the quality of the acting keep it worth watching.";

Probably most interesting beyond the story itself is a quick analysis of each character by each of the actors who leaves his or her role for a moment. They discuss how they view their people with a great deal of depth and insight. I wonder if they were prompted or it was extemporaneous. I would guess the latter. As with most Bergman characters the people are doomed to their suffering and offer little comfort because they are so full of angst themselves. The living Andreas is a complex bundle of nerves. If he hadn't seen the animal killer and rescued the dog I might have seen him as unbalanced enough to do these things himself. Of course the story never makes point but the thought occurred to me. Anna is a royal mess but is able to keep her composure with those tight lips and that half smile. Pushed she becomes a powder keg. As is usually the case their personal problems are never solved and we wonder what the next frame in the film will be. It's quite a thoughtful and frightening film.".

It stars many of the Bergman retinue of actors Max Von Sydow as Andreas Winkelman Liv Ullman as Anna Fromm Bibi Andersson as Eva Vergerus and Erland Josephson as Elis Vergerus.It follows Andreas an exconvict as he recovers from his wife's abandonment on a small farm on a Swedish island ostensibly Bergman's own Far where it was filmed. One day Anna a crippled widow comes to his home and Andreas listens in on the phone call she needs to make. She then accidentally or not? leaves her purse at his house and he reads a letter of her rocky marriage as he digs through her purse to find her address and learns of her dead husband's fears for her sanity. When he returns the purse that night he meets the Vergeruses the couple whom Anna lives with. He is later invited over to dinner and the foursome discuss life and philosophy..Throughout the film a number of other subtexts emerge such as Bergman again breaking the fictive spell of the film by having his four main actors portray themselves talking about their characters. Another side story involves the abuse torture and killing of local animals. A local hermit with a history of mental instability is suspected. Andreas knows the man Johan Andersson Erik Hell and it's clear he is not the culprit because he is an old lumbering man and early in the film the audience glimpsed a young man speedily running away from a scene where he is hanging the puppy that Andreas saves. Nonetheless as sheep and other animals are killed a band of young vigilante islanders have apparently beaten and tortured the old man to confess. This act of cruelty drives him to suicide and he leaves a note of thanks for Andreas for all his kindnesses that the police bring to him.This film's ending is famous but has been misinterpreted in many ways. First Bergman has admitted in print that he did not zoom in to get the graininess of the final images but merely blew up the shot. As for what it means? Many take it simply as the psychological dissolution of Andreas Winkeleman which is the final in a series of character dissolutions in this series of late 1960s films.But that's too melodramatic a claim..The ending leaves a visceral impact both for its visuals and its often overlooked critical revelation.The film succeeds magnificently in an understated way that many of Bergman's more famous films do not.

While I didn't really like either of those two I still appreciated them for their visual style especially THE HOUR OF THE WOLF. However I just downright hated this one. The only reason I watched it is because I wanted to see more Bergman films since his reputation is just astounding. The characters are so bland they had to include scenes where the actors explain to you why you should care about them. The characters are so bland that I was completely indifferent to the outcomes of spousal abuse and attempted murder. It comes as no surprise that this film is also insanely boring seeing as it was directed by Ingmar Bergman. Almost nothing worth watching happens until about 1 hour and 30 minutes in. Now is a good time to mention that the movie is about 1 hour and 40 minutes long. Nearly everything memorable before that point is animal abuse. For example a puppy being hanged 15 minutes in. Of course Max's character saves the dog and gives him to some other character later and it is never mentioned again. So why was the dog introduced? Oh to show that there was an animal slaughterer on the loose. Why is that important? Because a friend of Max's kills himself because he is accused of being the killer. But why do we care about that? It barely even had an effect on Max. Plus we barely even knew the friend so it didn't really impact us as an audience. And how was it determined that he was the animal killer? Who was it that beat up the friend resulting in his suicide? Did they ever find out who the real killer was? Why was he killing the animals? Should we even care? What happened to the puppy? What happened with the character who got the puppy? What happened with that character's husband? What was up with the pictures? Who's Andreas? Isn't Max Andreas? Why did Max have the same name as Anna's exhusband? Are the two Andreases the same person? Wouldn't that mean that the film takes place in both the past and present tense? Am I overthinking it? Isn't the point to think about it? Am I thinking about the wrong thing? Why aren't I thinking of the right thing? Oh yeah it's because this is a bad film. This film did nothing but anger me. Scenes that came out of nowhere and went nowhere characters I couldn't care less about emotionless acting in emotional situations a complete lack of events and a lessthanamazing style. This film is quite frankly a joke.".

	schema:headline " The best martial arts film ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "Rarely have I been so astounded by such a magnificent aweinspiring film. If you have not yet placed your eyes on this masterpiece of Chinese cinema then I cannot recommend this film highly enough. 'Hero' is by far the best Chinese film I have ever seen and already a firm favourite of all time.The imagery is unparallelled simply drawdroppingly near perfect scenes with bold and vibrant use of colour symbolism and scenery. The fluent flow of the storyline the delicate direction of the sword slicing action the Chinese cultural concepts and the emotionally charged scenes between characters combine to produce a simply remarkable achievement. This film has a few elements from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon but is far far superior in every way. The sleek direction from Yimou Zhang is so perfectly done just imagine two martial arts experts ensuing in battle against each other defying the laws of physics as we know it and yet following them in 360 degrees in slow motion as one deflects a droplet of rain from one sword to the other at the same time spinning and leaping over water... simply beautiful. The attack sequences are also superbly set with hundreds of thousands of the King's warriors in formation simultaneously firing enough arrows into the city which literally cover the sky in addition to the viewer being able to watch the journey of a single arrowhead aimed during this event. The build up to the attack along with the unnerving tune of a Chinese stringed instrument help you as the audience to become firmly engrossed in your seat. The individual martial arts is also second to none for myself particularly to see the distant shots of the whole battle sequence showing the true skills involved with fighting such as footwork perfect timingaggression counter attacks and defence. Jet Li shows he is truly the grand daddy of martial arts. I cannot stress enough how much you need this film in your life. The colourful imagery imposed by the director will take your breath away with luscious vivid bright windblowndraped backgrounds as the setting for the important progression of the story. Even the story itself is brought to the audience in such a way which ensures your undivided attention as there are twists in the tales and hidden plots which do not develop until the end of the film.Even short individual scenes are memorable due to their sheer awesome display of skill and speed. This film even holds a political message which is relevant to all times especially in today's Americanlead world dominance. This film has absolutely everything  including an extremely sexy young Ziyi Zhang who simply is the biggest hype to come out of china since SARS. This film was released in 2002 but this is certainly one of my all time favourites and will probably be the best film I see all year. I have never been more enthusiastic to pursue films in this genre in my life. For more action type enthusiasts who like more gore and violence check out 'Ong Bak' but for people who appreciate a fuller visionary piece of martial arts filming this will leave you speechless.".

Everywhere the film is shown there will a segment of the audience that will love and rave about it and another segment that will be wondering if they had been watching the same movie.

The direction and photography is artsy without being pretentious.  Every shot is worthy of being a work of art in itself.  The language spoken is traditional mandarin but oh so easy to the ear even though i couldn't understand every word. I don't think Tony's and Maggie's voices were dubbed but i could be mistaken.  The main characters were very well acted out especially that of the role of the Qin Emperor.  Zhang Ziyi's character was largely insignificant though so i think she's been put in to add some star power to the production.  The fighting scenes are unusual by most standards employing an interesting combination of CGI and real action.  Some of the powers that the characters possess appear too amazing to be true but remember that some of the fights only took place in the fighters' imagination.  The music though quite similar to that in CTHD is appropriate and sticks hauntingly to the back of your mind long after the movie is over.I went to the cinema having heard some of the hype leading to the movie but with no real knowledge of the storyline and not expecting a lot.  I think that helped me enjoy the movie more because the way the story unfolded actually set me thinking and anticipating in a manner that i could not have had i known more about the storyline.  The message at the end of the movie is simple but certainly open for debate.  In fairness i don't think the director attempted to provide an answer as to whether the decision made by the Nameless One was the correct one or not but rather to ask questions. I'd better not give out too much here but it certainly set me thinking about things for a little while after the show had ended.  These days any movie that can get me pondering after the credits go down has got to be pretty good.Overall an excellent movie.

	schema:headline " A most beautifully questionable film";
	schema:reviewBody "After two years of hearing about the myth of the most expensive Chinese film ever made Hero has finally floated on to British cinema screens. As it flies it trails a coloured cloth that carries the film's numerous morals and messages which descend upon you like a soft layer of fabric. This is a film that can lift your spirits and have you laughing out in sheer joy as you gaze in wonder at the perfection of the miseenscene and cinematography. That is if you let the film take you on a journey without pondering the films questionable plot points.Hero is two sides of a tale as presented by Nameless Jet Li a mere Prefect who defeated three deadly assassins and the King of Qin Daoming Chen the man the assassins wished to kill. Nameless weaves his heroic though modest story of how he killed the assassins but the King remains unconvinced spinning his own version of how he believed events unfolded.Director Yimou Zhang takes us through Nameless' story first spreading the battle sequences thick allowing them to take their own time. In the King's version certain battles are then revised which is remarkably brave considering that some battles are utter fabrications. In one such fictitious fight in a faultlessly designed set Nameless and Sky Donnie Yen close their eyes and fight out the battle within their minds. Screen time is being spent lavishly on showing how two characters contemplated a fight whilst fighting each other in a battle that never occurred. It is confusing certainly but perhaps Zhang wished for his audience to get lost in the plot's design so that they would not question the warrantability of half of the battle sequences which make up most of the film.Yet it is difficult to ponder these details when they are made so utterly insignificant when viewing such a spectacle. The sheer beauty of the battles the gentle floating of the assassins as they fly around their arenas which range from a forest full of orange leafed trees crisp leaves falling down to the ground like rain to the crystal clear and calm of a mountain lake the costumes of characters at varying stages in the story line red for passion green for youth white for truth blue for love the amazing army scenes which feature thousands of arrows being fired into the sky to create a black cloud that descends right on top of the camera all these elements combine to produce a faultlessly perfect image on the screen each frame a worthy photograph that gently reminds you why cinema is the greatest art form of the twentieth century.And characterisation is not lost in this beauty as one may have feared. Despite the irritating two dimensional performance of Zhang Ziyi as Moon the other actors carry off fine performances especially Tony Leung Chiu Wai as Broken Sword and Daoming Chen as the King. Their performances are especially credible as they are often drowning in the memories of the King and Nameless  they need to change slight mannerisms in order to reflect whose mind they are now in.The script too is of an impressively high standard. The moments of clarity that the warriors feel are experienced by the audience also and there are some very informed outlooks of the emptiness of warfare communicating that to achieve peace sometimes war is the only option. These messages of course seem fitting in our current times underlining how ancient some of the methods of our governing body truly are. Hero is undoubtedly a most beautiful and awe inspiring film. What it lacks in plot substance it makes up for with structure and script. It elaborates on the ground work created by 'Crouching Tiger' and is an experience that I would encourage you to seek out as long as you are willing to submit to the film and let it guide you through its world on its own terms.Rating 45".

	onyx:emotionText "After two years of hearing about the myth of the most expensive Chinese film ever made Hero has finally floated on to British cinema screens. As it flies it trails a coloured cloth that carries the film's numerous morals and messages which descend upon you like a soft layer of fabric. This is a film that can lift your spirits and have you laughing out in sheer joy as you gaze in wonder at the perfection of the miseenscene and cinematography. That is if you let the film take you on a journey without pondering the films questionable plot points.Hero is two sides of a tale as presented by Nameless Jet Li a mere Prefect who defeated three deadly assassins and the King of Qin Daoming Chen the man the assassins wished to kill. Nameless weaves his heroic though modest story of how he killed the assassins but the King remains unconvinced spinning his own version of how he believed events unfolded.Director Yimou Zhang takes us through Nameless' story first spreading the battle sequences thick allowing them to take their own time. In the King's version certain battles are then revised which is remarkably brave considering that some battles are utter fabrications. In one such fictitious fight in a faultlessly designed set Nameless and Sky Donnie Yen close their eyes and fight out the battle within their minds. Screen time is being spent lavishly on showing how two characters contemplated a fight whilst fighting each other in a battle that never occurred.

	schema:reviewBody "Before I give my review let me offer one suggestion that will help you appreciate this film. DO NOT SEE IT JUST ONCE. Watch it twice and then pass judgment. The film is so visually and artistically captivating that the plot can be harder to grasp the first time around. The second time around you'll get a better appreciation for the film.I viewed this film with high expectations. People were comparing it with Crouching Tiger and I really enjoyed that film. Within the first 10 minutes you understand why the comparisons are made. The cinematography editing music and special effects are similar. The stories however are quite different and I found the story to be better than the one in Crouching Tiger.The story is about an assassin who concocts a plan to kill a king who had been trying to conquer his home land in preunified China. His assassination plan requires him to get close enough to the king to strike him dead. The movie shows the assassin's plan through a series of flashbacks and culminates with the assassin getting his chance to kill the king.The beauty of this film is the how the assassin becomes a Hero. I won't spoil how he achieves this but that is what made the film great for me. It made the film more than just a visual and musical masterpiece. It also made it more than just a Kung Fu picture. It actually added a decent plot to the film which made it worth while. Honestly I was just expecting a good Kung Fu picture. Hero is actually a great overall movie which just happens to accent the film with some of the best Kung Fu action in recent years.Definitely the best movie that I have seen this year. I hope it wins big at the awards ceremonies. It was impressive. DP.".

	schema:reviewBody "It sounded like a HK Cinema fan's ultimate wet dream... Zhang Yimou to direct a martial arts epic with Jet Li Maggie Cheung Leung Chiu Wai Zhang Ziyi and Donnie Yen in the cast Ching SiuTung doing the action Christopher Doyle the cinematography and Emil Wada the costumes. What more could you ask for? Well Brigitte Lin coming out of retirement and Yuen Wo Ping and Sammo Hung sharing the action director credits perhaps.I guess we have CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON to thank for making the wu xia world bankable again and generating the interest and investment required to bring a project of this stature together. There's no doubt that the US Market was a major target and US went into the funding. Given this it's a tragedy that Yimou let Miramax get their paws on it and effectively ruin any chances it had of major US successApart from Zhang Ziyi and the Tan Dun soundtrack a terrible choice no doubt enforced by US investors CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON is not a good reference point by which to evaluate HERO. Much more appropriate is Wong Kar Wai's ASHES OF TIME with which it shares two lead actors and a cinematographer. HERO is definitely more commercially oriented but shares a beauty and philosophical richness with AOT and a certain melancholy mood.The story of HERO starts off quite simply as Jet Li begins to recount his martial triumphs to the Emperor of Qin. The tale is told in flashbacks which revisit and reevaluate the same events elaborating on and changing the story as we learn more. It's reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON and is a great way of developing a mystery thriller. Zhang Yimou handles the building of the tale expertly as one would expect from such a master film maker.Zhang Yimou himself is such an accomplished cinematographer he hardly needed to hire somebody else for the job  but if there's anybody better than Yimou it's Christopher Doyle. I wonder how much conflict there was on set though as I am sure each had very strong visions of how they wanted scenes to look. The result doesn't show any signs of it if such a conflict occured though as the visual style seems exceptionally strong and focussed throughout. A large part of this is Yimou's use of bold colours to delineate the different sections of the story The green the red the yellow the blue the white. With Emil Wada's stunning costumes and the great choice of locations HERO is almost as rich in stunning imagery as ASHES OF TIME. It's a true work of art harking back to Yimou's older films like SHANGHAI TRIAD and RAISE THE RED LANTERN  I'm really pleased to see him making such visual films again. The visuals are sometimes let down by some unconvincing CGI effects unfortunately.Zhang Yimou has never directed an action movie before so people were clearly worried he wouldn't know what to do with the fight scenes that a wu xia movie needs more than anything else. It's been quite a few years since Ching Siu Tung has produced any really impressive work too so I was rather worried  especially when I heard from good authority that Yimou had Ching had clashed on set. Apparently Zhang wanted more grounded realistic kung fu which really isn't Ching Siu Tung's thing should have got Sammo or Yuen Wo Ping!. I guess Ching got the upper hand in the end as the fight scenes are certainly not grounded or realistic  they're very much about the twirling and whirling and the graceful flying that Ching Siu Tung virtually defined. They're not as manic as he usually makes the action when he directs himself though  a fact that sometimes makes the wirework look a bit awkward.A real surprise is that the weakest fight scene of the film is that one that pits the two best martial artists together. Jet Li vs. Donnie Yen opens the film with some sword vs. spear action. There's some beautiful moments but I felt the scene lacked impact and featured some awkward moves too. Oddly enough the fight I enjoyed the most featured no real martial artistry at all  Maggie Cheung vs well you'll see in a beautiful autumnal scene of falling leaves. I guess that's because Ching Siu Tung is really not working to his strengths when he tries to do real martial arts.I had held off watching HERO for months because as soon as I got the first released DVD the DVD5 from Guang Dong Face Ah it was announced that the extended version of the film would be released in a few weeks. It's generally well known now that Zhang Yimou was persuaded to cut about 20 minutes from the film by the hatchet men at MiramAXE who really must die first when the revolution comes. I figured the first time I see it I should see the best possible version for maximum impact so I was willing to wait. Well it's been 2 months now and the extended version is now indefinitely delayed due to legal issues so I finally gave in and watched the DVD I'd had lying around for so long. Now that I've seen it I have to say I don't really see what another 20 minutes would add to the film  it seems quite complete and well paced at about 95 minutes. A little more development of Donnie Yen's character would be nice but other than that it's hard to imagine what is missing. Longer action scenes maybe? Or perhaps just 20 minutes of Christopher Doyle's beautifully composed landscape shots or close ups of Maggie Cheung dying.I'm glad I waited to see the film anyway though as it allowed all the hype and anticipation to die down.  Unfortunately when a film is as highly anticipated as this it's inevitable that there will be backlash syndrome as people feel let down that it wasn't the ultimate movie of all time they heardhoped it would be it was amusing to watch the reviews on CROUCHING TIGER swing between incredible and awful as hype waves ruined the experience for many and I'm sure the same will happen with HERO.Zhang Yimou is an extremely talented director in many respects but perhaps the greatest is his ability to get incredible performances out of his cast. With such an illustrious cast on board he perhaps felt he didn't need to try as much though or they weren't willing to listen as the acting isn't as powerful as I had expected. It's still of a very high quality but doesn't evoke the same strong emotions as some of the performances in ASHES OF TIME. Leung ChiuWai gets the top award for acting though which will surprise few people. Zhang Ziyi only has a small part but shows a lot of talent too  nice to see such skill in somebody that still has most of her career ahead of her. Of course it was Zhang Yimou that discovered and nurtured her talent in THE ROAD HOME.There are only two disappointments in HERO for me. One is the special effects which aren't up to the very latest standards. A little less use of CGI would have made it go a lot further like in CTHD. The other is the soundtrack which is really just much too similar to the Crouching Tiger soundtrack. It doesn't fit HERO as well but it is still pretty evocative and effective  just too similar to CTHD.I still intend to pick up the extended version of HERO when it's released to see what Zhang Yimou's ideal vision for the film was. Even running shorter than he really wanted it's a mighty fine film though and one I have no hesitation in recommending if anybody hasn't seen it yet. If MiramAXE ever do get round to releasing it in the US I hope it does well.".

This luxurious martial arts film was marvelously filmed with good production design  fabulous costumes by Emi Wada  luxurious cinematography and breathtaking scenes . It's considered by some reviewers as an ambiguous apologia for state violence but jammed as philosophical arts martial picture . The flick displays spectacular and overwhelming battles with lots of extras including use of arches  arrows and lances . In fact  all of the soldiers in the Qin army sequence as well as the palace sequences were performed by actual Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers except the stunt performers  it's estimated that 18000 were used as extras in the film . This is a colourful China set and expensively budgeted movie  leave no clich untouched  though the fighting are magnificently staged . The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with frenetic action  surprises  fierce combats and overwhelming struggles . The lake scenes took almost three weeks to film because director Yimou Zhang insisted that the lake's surface had to be perfectly still and mirrorlike during filming . Amid the grandeur of the scenarios and impressive fights is developed an intrigue about the China unification . Maggie Cheung required weeks of training  even Ziyi Zhang who earned rave reviews with her martial arts performance in Cruching tiger  hidden dragon2000 needed intensive training to become adept with the twin blades she fights with during many of her scenes in Hero . Colorful and brilliant cinematography by Christopher Doyle  Ziyi's ordinary . Appropriate as well as evocative musical score by Dan Tu  he is especially known for his work on Crouching tiger  hidden dragon 2000 that won Academy Award and Fallen 1998. The motion picture was compellingly directed by the Chinese Zhang Ziyi who has established himself firmly as a distinguished filmmakerproducer whose last films have generated millions in China box office . Originally released in 2002 in Asia it would not be another two years until this film was released in the United States . Studio executives were concerned that the foreignlanguage film would not be successful at the box office with American audiences .

In all three films her romantic relationship is ended with the death of either herself or her boyfriend . Zhang Yimou is an excellent and veteran director who in his films often explores the dark side of life in small Chinese rural communities .

	schema:headline " Spectacular Stunning Visuals SoSo Story";
	schema:reviewBody "After two viewings I am still not sure what to make of this film storywise. I have no problems exalting praise for the cinematography which for many people was the drawing point. It's what got me to watch the movie. I had heard it was the most beautiful film ever made. Well I wouldn't go that far but it IS visually spectacular. It's even more appreciated now that I watched one of the documentaries in which I learned to what great lengths director Yimou Zhang the crew went to to make this look so good. It took a lot of patience waiting for just the right conditions such as the smooth silvery lake which only was calm two hours a day.Overall I didn't think the story was that appealing except for the good message at the end about the good of all being more important than satisfying one's personal vengeance. Well who could argue with that? As for the rest perhaps being a Westerner unfamiliar with Eastern culture it's harder for me to relate to the mindset. I would be interested to know how Asians viewed this story as opposed to similar films.Sometimes I think these wild Crouching Tigerlike action scenes are too long and overdone but at least in this film they were very original and once again more visuals feasts than anything else. On my second viewing I discarded the subtitles and went with the dubbed version to concentrate more on the stunning look of this film. It paid off. Even if I don't quite follow everything each scene is such eyecandy that you can't go wrong viewing this.".

	schema:headline " The real Hero";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Zhang Yimou's Hero is playing around the country to widespread critical acclaim. It is undoubtedly one of the most visually beautiful movies of our time. However American audiences may not fully appreciate what message comes wrapped in this beautiful package.Hero rewrites history's judgment on the movie's central figure the Emperor Qin  a ruthless leader who unified China through the most brutal means  by depicting him as a tough but benevolent and misunderstood monarch in the process also changing the story of the failed assassination attempt on him as well.The historical Emperor Qin was known for his cruelty. The movie does refer to his practice of slaughtering entire villages. It is silent about the tortures he employed the draconian legal code that involved the cutting off of limbs his burning of books and suppression of schools of thought or such incidents as the burying alive of hundreds of scholars who had objected to his rule.The reason for the differences between the historical Emperor Qin and the movie's retelling may be found in the needs of the Chinese Communist Party CCP.Even before unifying China the thenKing of Qin was hated and feared by both rivals and subjects alike. The neighboring state of Yan replaced with Zhao in the movie knew that the state of Qin aimed eventually to attack. Officials in the Yan kingdom hired an assassin to kill the King of Qin and help them escape imminent defeat. Jing Ke the man selected for the job had to find a method to bring himself close to the King to complete his mission. Pan Yuqi was a disgruntled Qin official who had fled to the state of Yan to escape from the King of Qin's tyrannical rule. He so hated the King of Qin that he offered to allow himself to be killed in order that Jing could gain access by bringing his head to the despot. Jing killed him and brought both Pan's head and a map of the state of Yan that the king coveted hiding in it a dagger with which to assassinate the tyrant.The King of Qin indeed allowed Jing Ke in his presence and as the king opened the map offered to him the assassin deftly procured the knife hidden in the map scroll. Unfortunately Jing's initial thrust was not strong enough grazing but not wounding the king. The king was then able to unsheathe his sword and parry any of Jing's successive thrusts. The assassin had no choice but to hurl his weapon at the monarch but missed. He was later executed.In Hero the assassin played by Jet Li has the opportunity and the skill to dispatch the King yet decides against it. After abandoning his decision to kill the king he is executed and then buried as a hero.The Jet Li character is called Nameless. Nameless chooses loyalty and his own death after a long conversation with the King of Qin. The king asserts that Nameless's quest is only negative he acts out of hatred and revenge. He reveals that he himself is misunderstood that the king's strength is used for the sake of unifying a great Chinese nation a nation that will comprise everything under heaven this crucial phrase was translated in English as our land.Like the Emperor Qin Mao Zedong upon winning the civil war against Chiang Kai Sheik unified China. Mao was an open admirer of the Qin Emperor. This oftenhated emperor came to be seen as a symbol for the Communist Party.Since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 the Chinese Communist Party has used China's state controlled media to make the claim that the Communist Party exists for the sake of a great and unified China. Love of China and love of the Party are conflated and love of China is taught to be of supreme importance.Zhang's movie fits the CCP script very neatly. It appropriates China's history its founding moment the unification by the Emperor Qin and uses that history to teach the very same lessons that CCP has taught the need to give up individual claims what we today call rights for the sake of a great and powerful China under the rule of a strong leader the CCP.The leaders of the CCP wish the viewers of the movie to forget some other parallels with the Emperor of Qin. Similar to the Qin Emperor the People's Republic of China is one of the most brutal and reviled governments in the world. Just as the Emperor of Qin suppressed Confucianism and persecuted those who objected to his rule the CCP persecutes and tortures all of those with views and beliefs differing from the Party including Falun Gong practitioners house Christians Uigher Muslims union organizers and democracy activists.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two things interesting about this project. First the sad news at least for the Chinese that the Japanese have finally won. This is a Japanese film in all important respects the theming by lush color the rather modern notion of benevolent conquest genuinely originating in the Persians but only used since as justification for selfish empire specifically in this case Japanese conquest  and adopted by the Chinese only since the war and of course the wholesale swallowing of Kurosawa.Kurosawa is here obviously in the story it is half 'Rashomon' and half 'Ran.' But more important is Kurosawa's theory of film as a device to capture space. As with Parisian impressionist painters the thing painted is not the point. It provides an origin only the painting is about all the magical things that happen in the space between the subject and the viewers eye. The paintings and Kurosawa's films are about that space.Kurosawa invented the technique of shooting from very far away with a telephoto so as to flatten space and at the same time creating usually three layers of space. Often he would engage the space directly.This masterful film is obsessive about the point and may be the most lush swim in dimensional space you are likely to find with the technology we have. Every shot is oriented around not the action but the space that contains the action. Falling water dust lots of blown fabric and hair feathers arrows even book tablets and those leaves! With lots of bamboo screens all these are used to show the space plus the usual fantastic mountains clouds and forests  even at the end the Great Wall and of course the moving waves of soldiers and courtiers.Many of the architectural shots are lifted from Welles' Othello.The matter is not lost in the copious allusions to mental space the game of Go music calligraphy politics and love. All these are defined exercised and conflated with one another in terms of space and the intrigue of space with a little more effort in the latter items on the list. Then waving lamps are used to make 'murderous intent' spatial.Unlike 'Crouching Tiger' which this resembles not at all the camera is static not dancing. Where Lee emphasized the ballet of the fight by engaging his camera Zhang stands back in the space. Where Lee conceives fights not among the participants but their masters Zhang shows us not the fights but the battles among the true worlds of the fights  the worlds of different colors.What we see could be the imaged Go game or the imaged fight within it or the imaged story Nameless tells or the one the King tells and on and on with nestings of imaginations. Every nation creates their own movie to explain themselves. We in the US seem to like more militarist stuff. Except for the thuggish motive my war for my kind of peace we would do well to have stories about stories like this one through four layers until they reflect back on the origin. Complex story space in rich real space.If you are going to see this you really must see 'In the Mood for Love' which features Broken Sword and Flying Snow in something of the same relationship they have here. It is one of the best films ever made and truly spatial in a purely Chinese manner. It will completely transform your enjoyment of this.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Personally I have seen Crouching tiger and that's about the size of it so I can genuinely say that this film came as a real shock to me in almost every aspect! The most obvious thing about the film is the way in which it is shot. The scenes themselves are astonishingly beautiful deeply affecting and I would guess just as important as the action that they contain. The scenes engaged me in the same way that great art engages. I wanted to keep looking at them enjoying the visual perfection.Against this perfect background the fight scenes are dreamlike and beautifully choreographed. They highlight the fantastic art of the fighters and reinforce the link between the understanding of form in combat and form in calligraphy or art.The simple beautiful nature of the combat the colours the scenes and even the names of the assassins serve to underline the simplicity of the story and reinforce its powerful if controversial message. The assassin becomes a hero by understanding that the creation of 'Our Land' is superior to his own revenge and the chaos that would be created by that revenge.The conclusion that the greater good of society should supersede the individual's selfish goals probably has more resonance in China than it does in the West but the point is made powerfully but above all beautifully made.Well worth watching!".

The assassin becomes a hero by understanding that the creation of 'Our Land' is superior to his own revenge and the chaos that would be created by that revenge.The conclusion that the greater good of society should supersede the individual's selfish goals probably has more resonance in China than it does in the West but the point is made powerfully but above all beautifully made.Well worth watching!";

	schema:reviewBody "Most people are quick to compare Ying Xiong Hero to Wo Hu Cang Long Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. They are both in the same genre but entirely different movies.While it is important to note that both films are masterpieces of cinematic opera Wo Hu Cang Long is a throwback to the classic action epics of early Chinese films similar to the swashbuckling films out of Hollywood. It makes no apologies for the silliness of the early films including flying swordfighters. Ying Xiong is more of a play on those films and the stories that inspired them.Jet Li plays a nameless assassin who offers the King of Qin the weapons of his three greatest enemies. In doing so he tells a fanciful tale of how he defeated them with both his sword and his mind. Following this the King explains what he believes took place. It is a tale of deceit aimed at getting the assassin in place to kill the King. Their stories are enacted on screen through a feast of color and sound.Knowing a touch of Chinese history it is clear that the King of Qin cannot be killed. He unites all of China under one ruler. Like watching Titanic while knowing that it would sink in the end it is still captivating to see how the nameless assassin will react as the King uncovers his secret motive.It is also important to note that all of the fanciful swordplay and flying takes place in the stories told by the assassin and the King not in the parts of the film intended to be on a real world foundation. For those who were turned off by the unrealistic stunts in Wo Hu Cang Long it is easy to accept the same actions in Ying Xiong.".

	schema:headline " Creepy film and creepy reviewers";
	schema:reviewBody "There are things that people must understand when we look at a film like this  the historical background and its significance in its current political and cultural settings.So first thing first  who is the King of Qin later the Qin Emperor? He was and still is a highly controversial character from over two thousands years ago who is notable for unifying China but also someone vilified throughout Chinese history for his cruelty and brutality in the pursuit of his objective. He can be regarded as a the founder of the country called China the English word China is often thought to be derived from the word Qin but the dynasty he founded collapsed rapidly after his death due to widespread civil revolt as a result of the hatred for his regime.What is his significance at present time in China? The Qin Emperor was hated throughout much of Chinese history but attempts were made to rehabilitate his reputation in recent times most notably by Chairman Mao during the 1970's. To the Chinese historical justification of a political regime is important and Mao before his death was concerned about his reputation after his death and made a conscious attempt to justify his totalitarian and brutal regime. Thus the Qin Emperor was praised for the destruction of division in favour of unification note that this is the point made by the film and that his brutality was justified as necessary in difficult times. In fact the criticism of him was that he wasn't totalitaran enough perhaps in retrospect that is something that Mao was able to outdo the Qin Emperor. This image of the good dictatorship despite the great evils done is one that the current inheritor of Mao's China is keen to maintain.The Qin Emperor is therefore not just an interesting historical figure but someone who embodies the mindset of the ruling elite of present day China. And we can therefore understand this film in term of the political and cultural context of the current regime in China the film has the full approval of the Government of PR China. It tells us that division means violence therefore there can be no independent Tibet or Taiwan and to ensure peace there has to be single dictatorship and state violence is necessary furthermore individuals must be prepared to sacrifice themselves to achieve such end.The easiest way for nonChinese to understand this is to imagine of something that never happened  the unification of Europe by Nazi Germany this is not an unreasonable comparison as the Qin Emperor had in China before Mao's revisionism about the same reputation as Hitler. To ensure peace in Europe you should argue that there must be no separate nation states in Europe and brutality is necessary to ensure peace. Peace is the be all and end all even if as can see that in fact there has been relative peace in Western Europe after the Second World War with the separate nation states still intact.And from this we can see from this how creepy some of the reviewers are. One guy from Germany argued that we should forget about the politics and just concentrate on the beauty of the film. Just imagine saying that about Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph des Willens strange that it should come from a German. One guy argued that it is about peace and unification is necessary to ensure it. But we can see that this is a completely bogus argument when we look at history unified Qin collapsed in violence quickly while Europe remains in relative peace as separate nation states. One guy from the US argued that unlike the selfcentredness of Western culture people in Chinese expect to make sacrifice for the greater good. Well tell that to the Chinese people living in US that they should be prepared to sacrifice their human rights for the good of the US government and see how far you will get.Other reviewers stated that the film is not totally sympathetic to the Qin Emperor as it showed him losing control he cannot pardon Nameless and must execute Nameless because his bureaucrats think he must. This makes the message of the film even worse  you should sacrifice your life for a totalitarian state effectively ruled by faceless and heartless bureaucrats? I can't imagine anything worse.It is in all a creepy film with a creepy message supported by some creepy reviewers. Sad to see this listed among the top 250 films in IMDb.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is impossible to avoid comparing Zhang Yimou's Hero' to Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.'  They were both bigbudget Chinese kungfu films with breathtaking cinematography of Chinese landscape and a cast of superstars. But aside from the obvious there is in fact nothing else to compare. Hero' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters proving that bigname stars beautiful scenery and action effects are no replacement for a director's artistry and vision.All the marketing hype preceding the premier of Hero' has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one.  Much anticipated Hero' drew moviegoers in throngs when it first opened at theaters in mainland China and Hong Kong making it an instant boxoffice success. However though the script pleased government censors Chinese audiences went to newfound heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain. Online critics both professional and amateur proclaimed the film ideologically disturbing' from the viewpoint of deep servitude' written either by an amateur historian or someone with ulterior motives.' One article was simply titled Hero you make me sick!'The deepest failing of the film is in its plot which is not only morally reprehensible and based on unforgivable historic fallacy but  worst of all for a film  is boring! All blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history but Hero' goes beyond artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to glorify an emperor that was as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. Hero' does not make up for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or fun.  Instead it is makes a woefully poor attempt at being deep' and merely manages to be pretentious and preachy.Though historians agree that the First Emperor of China was ruthlessly violent Mao Zedong was known to have admired this ruler  no surprise given Mao's own tyrannical rule.  Likewise the Communist government in Beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the First Emperor and its own ironfist methods so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by Zhang Yimou. Tony Leung one of the stars of Hero' remarked during an interview to promote the film that the Beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing the student demonstrations because it was needed to maintain stability' in China.  For these remarks Tony Leung received shocked criticisms in his home city of Hong Kong but he merely stated out loud the underlying message of the movie.Director Zhang Yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass the values of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kungfu novels and movies to reveal a higher wisdom. Unfortunately his version of wisdom' turns out to be THE OPPRESSOR IS RIGHT. In China where thousands of years of historical reality have rammed this message through art was the last sanctuary where the individual could actually find freedom from such tyranny. The great popularity of the kungfu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternate world one where kungfu warriors roamed the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice free from fear and winning against all odds with their superhuman skills. Only in the novel did the individual ever win over institutionalized power in China and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions. Going against this tradition of the kungfu hero Zhang Yimou has not gone upwards towards a higher truth as he had hoped but downwards to the level of government propaganda.  It's no wonder the government was so pleased.Some film lovers may secretly wonder All moralistic judgments aside is it at least entertaining?'  Fortunately the answer is a resounding No!' Because the same tale is told over and over with only slight variations it becomes tedious to watch. Moreover the three conflicting versions of the same story serves only to confuse the character development since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them once the real' version emerges.The film is not without its beautiful images. However all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect to or enhance the storyline. The use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the tale comes across as simplistic and contrived and the cinematography appears selfconsciously rather than truly beautiful. Great for a trailer but a disappointment once you are there to watch the entire film.For those in China who showed disdain for Crouching Tiger's' unrealistic kungfu much was expected from Hero.' Jet Li who plays the title role is a real kungfu artist who held national titles before beginning his career as an actor.  His previous movies have revealed limited acting abilities but many hoped that Zhang Yimou could use Li's lithe body movements to full effect while casting him properly in a role that would not task his acting abilities.  But it was not to be. Hero' attempts to go beyond the kungfu genre so there are not many fighting scenes and Jet Li is expected to perform a difficult piece of acting an inner transformation leading to profound wisdom and selfsacrifice. As the casting director ought to have expected Li fails miserably. Meanwhile the only fighting scene that reveals any true kungfu skill is the first one of the film between Li and and Donnie Yen.  All the scenes that follow are a disappointment so Hero' fails to satisfy even on that level.Though most audiences outside China are unlikely to be aware of the historical mangling of the story of the cruel First Emperor it seems even more unlikely that they would accept Zhang's version of Chinese wisdom' which is anything but. Perhaps the only time an audience coming out of a screening of Hero' was seen smiling  instead of yawning or frowning  was at the special screening for Chinese government officials.".

	schema:headline " Worthless Crouching Tiger Cash In";
	schema:reviewBody "From the Hong Kong actors to the Tan Dun score this reeks of a Crouching Tiger cash in by director Zhang Yimou . Unfortunately Hero is all style and painfully little substance. In fact on the rare occasion when you get substance or ideas they are usually so abhorrent you'd have rather they hadn't bothered.Briefly the story centres around a nameless one  the man with no name  Jet Li an assassin. He has killed three enemies of the Qin Emperor who in reward has granted him an audience. As the two men talk three versions of the Hero's story are told exploring themes such as loyalty honour and revenge. Each dominated by a prevailing colour. This all sounds very interesting. Problem is it isn't. It's 96 minutes of exquisitely pushed out excrement. But let's concentrate on the good points for a minute.Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are excellent. OK may be that took less than a minute.So what's wrong with this film. Well firstly there is no character development just a few good looking Chinese folk waving swords in a mildly diverting manner think the opening ceremony of the forthcoming Beijing Olympics. Because of this you can't really give a monkey's about any of the characters least of all Jet who scowls his way through the movie without ever giving you the impression that there's anything more meaningful on his mind than the sweet sound of sword on flesh.Then there is the upitsownbottompseudoartiness of it. There is an important point here. In Crouching Tiger when Chow YunFat and Zhang Ziyi dance on top of the bamboo forest it is beautiful not because the colours are rich the imagery is splendid and movement is graceful. Li Mu Bai is a character you care for showing a nobility of spirit we would like to aspire to. Ang Lee has already engaged you in his story you want to believe he can do it. Cue Tony Leung's spot of calligraphy while Jet Li and Maggie Cheung ward off a cloud of arrows. Graceful? Yes. Colourful? Yes. Foetid brace of severed cojones? Unfortunately so.I mean there are so many reasons to dislike this film I could go on all day. But since the main function of this review is to spare you the effort of seeing this worthless piece of tripe let's finish on the one idea this film pushes out in its hourandahalf passage through the lower colon of Chinese cinema. I'm going to give you a clue to the end of the film now so if you're still planning to see it poor sucker look away now.Apparently the emperor is just a misunderstood guy. I mean he's raped pillaged and slaughtered his way across Asia for one reason to unite China to end war presumably because anyone who didn't agree with him is dead. To this the nameless one replies 'oh yeah I guess you're really a nice guy then' and makes to leave. Some reviewers have said that Yimou doesn't comment on this explanation or decision. If this is so why does the director choose to end his film with a cut to the Great Wall of China with a nauseatingly jingoistic caption underneath saying 'Our Land'? So that's all right then. Hitler? Misunderstood Eurofederalist. Stalin? Cuddly peoplehugger. Rape of Nanking? Chinese just didn't understand what was good for them. See what I mean by 'rather they hadn't bothered'.To compare this monstrosity to Crouching Tiger is like whizzing on a Picasso to quote Mike Myers. Watch Springtime in a Small Town or Twilight Samurai. For goodness sake watch anything but this. If W made a movie about early America it would echo Hero. I can think of no greater criticism. 310 if that.".

	onyx:emotionText "From the Hong Kong actors to the Tan Dun score this reeks of a Crouching Tiger cash in by director Zhang Yimou . Unfortunately Hero is all style and painfully little substance. In fact on the rare occasion when you get substance or ideas they are usually so abhorrent you'd have rather they hadn't bothered.Briefly the story centres around a nameless one  the man with no name  Jet Li an assassin. He has killed three enemies of the Qin Emperor who in reward has granted him an audience. As the two men talk three versions of the Hero's story are told exploring themes such as loyalty honour and revenge. Each dominated by a prevailing colour. This all sounds very interesting. Problem is it isn't. It's 96 minutes of exquisitely pushed out excrement. But let's concentrate on the good points for a minute.Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are excellent. OK may be that took less than a minute.So what's wrong with this film. Well firstly there is no character development just a few good looking Chinese folk waving swords in a mildly diverting manner think the opening ceremony of the forthcoming Beijing Olympics. Because of this you can't really give a monkey's about any of the characters least of all Jet who scowls his way through the movie without ever giving you the impression that there's anything more meaningful on his mind than the sweet sound of sword on flesh.Then there is the upitsownbottompseudoartiness of it. There is an important point here. In Crouching Tiger when Chow YunFat and Zhang Ziyi dance on top of the bamboo forest it is beautiful not because the colours are rich the imagery is splendid and movement is graceful. Li Mu Bai is a character you care for showing a nobility of spirit we would like to aspire to. Ang Lee has already engaged you in his story you want to believe he can do it. Cue Tony Leung's spot of calligraphy while Jet Li and Maggie Cheung ward off a cloud of arrows. Graceful? Yes. Colourful? Yes. Foetid brace of severed cojones? Unfortunately so.I mean there are so many reasons to dislike this film I could go on all day. But since the main function of this review is to spare you the effort of seeing this worthless piece of tripe let's finish on the one idea this film pushes out in its hourandahalf passage through the lower colon of Chinese cinema.

	schema:headline " The Meanings Behind Hero's Colors";
	schema:reviewBody "According to Robert Mackey's interview with Christopher Doyle the cinematographer of Hero which was pubished in the New York Times the choice of colors for the film Hero was aesthetic not symbolic. However as viewers we are bound to create our own meanings for the color choices based on the emotion and mood of the scene. Here are the few reasons I thought of to explain each color choice. Red was used in the first version of the story wherein Broken Sword and Flying Snow are portrayed as foolish lovers ruled by jealousy and anger. Red may have been used to emphasize the furious passion between the couple. Blue was used in the Emperor's version of the story. It complemented the subdued more rational retelling. Blue brings to mind calmness which can be used to describe the King's version as well. Blue also highlighted the gloominess evoked in the scene wherein Nameless and Broken Sword grieve for Flying Snow through a sword fight. White was used in the final version of the story which was the true version. White usually connotes purity so it is a good choice of color for the true version which is untainted uncolored. White a color associated with death and mourning in Asian culture also foreshadowed the death of the key characters.Green is usually associated with memory with cognition. It is a perfect choice of color for the flashbacks. Black the dominant color in scenes where Nameless and the Emperor converse could have been used as a strong contrast against the colored versions to differentiate the actual narration from the various stories. Notice that black is the color worn by the government officials the soldiers the emperor's advisers and even by Nameless when he affiliates himself with the empire. Black may also symbolize the neutrality of the government.These are merely my own rationalizations and should not be taken to be factual. After all colors do not have exclusive meanings. The use of color in Hero was a really effective way of making sure the viewers understand the delineations between the different versions of the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is visually beautiful indeed but the story is just plainly stupid. Do not agree? Read on.We have 6 very welleducated Asian people all know this part of famous Chinese history more or less watching this movie together. At the end some feel so disappointed about the story and the others worse felt so disgusted by its builtin political messages.  Praise its photography as you wish but please don't tell me this is a great movie.  A beautiful movie with a terrible message can't be a great movie. It simply is NOT.Even with my high respect for Mr. Zhang's earlier works I can't help but feel so disappointed with this overhyped film.Warning Spoiler ahead The version I watched is the original Asian release issued in 2002 which is longer than this US version.1. Brief historic background In this movie the King of Qin state use his powerful troops mercilessly to invade the six other states in early China and eventually conquered them all to form his Qin empire.Historically he was the first emperor to unite China. In reality he was the coldblooded tyrant who achieved his ambition with brutal force and at the cost of numberless people's lives and blood. One chinese legend stated that his troop was ordered to kill bury alive 400000 surrendered soldiers from the neighbor state Zhao after one battle just to crush the morale of other resisting forces. This is just one of countless example of what he did to unite China.Due to his tyranny people hated him so much especially those from the six other conquered states. The great empire he spent his lifetime to build only last for 15 years one of the shortest in China's history. The empire soon turned into another chaotic battle field with all the uprising forces fighting against his heir until another new dynasty Han.The most laughable part and historically incorrect in this movie is that although the assassin have gone through so many years of preparation aiming to kill this brutal tyrant to save his own country and people he was so unbelievably easily persuaded or tricked by this King to give up his lifelong mission even at the cost of his own life and knowingly let this tyrant and his massive force finish crushing all other countries.A graceful assassin? or an unbelievably stupid idiot? Of course the history ended with the King has his way and had all the people in China kneel before him.  What a glorious story with a extremely stupid assassin.2. The message?  Is this really a propaganda film?So the message of this movie the best way for suffering people to end war is letting the powerful invading force finish their job letting the brutal tyrant be the emperor without resisting or trying to kill him then we will all get peace and become one united great country ?In short Let the big bad guy have his way with us and then we can all live peacefully afterward?  How intelligent and creative!!If the message in this movie is so true why should people fight in WW2? We should let Hitler conquer Europe and there will be no war over there after he finish all others just a great glorious NAZI empire?? We should let Japanese conquer the East Asia including China so there will be no more fighting and killing over there either???This is exactly why some people in Asia call this movie a piece of communist propaganda.  This is a good piece of work to teach the people to let their powerful totalitarian or not government have its way no matter how bad or controling it is so that there will be stability and a glorious united country.Now you know why Zhang YiMou whose earlier works were not really appreciated by the officials in China was suddenly so well funded and supported by Beijing in making this movie.Am I biased? Well I guess so. I know so much about this part of Chinese history and also the connection between this film and the Chinese government that I just can't pretend I am objective to call this movie a piece of pure art.This movie did not do too well in Asia.  I am surprised it do quite well in the US.  Funny.Praise its photography as you wish but please don't tell me this is a great movie.  A beautiful movie with a terrible message can't be a great movie. It is NOT.Sorry Mr. Zhang I can only give you 3 stars out of 10 this time. Even with my respect for your earlier works I can't help but feel so disgusted this time.3 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS SPOILERS Go Into Your Dance Warner Brothers 1935 directed by Archie L. Mayo with choreography by Bobby Connolly is a flimsy but highly entertaining showbiz musical that became the only film collaboration of the Jolsons Al and Ruby Keeler. Like most Jolson movies of that period Go Into Your Dance starts off with good comedy and wisecracks and during its final half hour or so changes to melodrama. In spite of mood swings the changes don't hurt the continuity in any way. Jolson appears to be more at ease with his comical oneliners and is much improved here as an actor during the more serious moments. Keeler gets to sing one song but she gets plenty of opportunity to go into her dancing.Opening title BROADWAY The street of ups and downs where show business in 1935 was in top speed. Story Al Howard Al Jolson is an irresponsible and egotistic entertainer responsible for his Broadway shows closing by not appearing. Al's sister Molly Glenda Farrell comes to the Actors Equity Association with the assurance that this will be Al's last time that he will ever desert a show but she is told by the producers that he is through on Broadway. Molly manages to get her old friend Dorothy Wayne Ruby Keeler a dancer to team up with Al in hope her partnership with him will lead up to his comeback. Dorothy agrees and she and Al become successful for the next several months appearing at Brown's St. Ledger Roof Garden. While Al treats Dorothy like a kid and philanders with other women especially chorus girls Dorothy who resents being treated this way unwittingly falls in love with Al and decides to leave the act. Molly however persuades Dorothy to remain and soon arranges to hire Duke Hutchinson Barton MacLane an underworld financier to back Al's new night club engagement The Casino De Paree in New York. In the meantime Al who considers himself God's gift to women becomes entangled with Luana Wells Helen Morgan a blues singer who happens to be Duke's wife wanting to also make a comeback on Broadway by appearing at the Casino De Paree. Before opening night Al is told by Dorothy after receiving a phone call that his sister Molly is in jail for murder. Al must decide whether to take the show's 30000 to bail out Molly or go on with the show as planned. If he abandons this show the Duke will have his thugs awaiting for him outside.Patsy Kelly not mentioned in the above synopsis provides true comedy relief in appearing in three separate scenes with Jolson actually unrelated to the plot as if she were added in at the last minute to boost up some comedy. In spite all it helps the continuity along. Kelly is a laugh riot and not to be missed. Glenda Farrell featured as Jolson's sister known best for usually playing a wisecracking and fasttalking golddigger gets her chance on film to play a basically straight character. Farrell only has one scene that does involve comedy which takes place on a train where she encounters a British passenger Arthur Treacher after accidentally dipping him with ink. She even gets her chance to wear stylish wardrobes and fur coat.Great tunes by Harry Warren and Al Dubin include Cielito Lindo written by Elpidio Ramirez and sung in Spanish by Jolson A Good OldFashioned Cocktail sungdanced by Ruby Keeler and chorus Mammy I'll Sing About You Jolson About a Quarter to Nine Swanee River by Stephen Foster sung briefly by Jolson in blackface The Little Things You Used to Do sung by Helen Morgan Casino De Paree She's a Latin From Manhattan Go Into Your Dance and a reprise finish to About a Quarter to Nine all sung by Jolson. During a night club sequence earlier in the story there is an underscoring by a band to the tune 'Cause My Baby Says It's So but is never sung in the story. Possibly an intended song for this movie but scrapped before release. That song would finally be heard and fully introduced by Dick Powell in The Singing Marine Warners 1937.

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS SPOILERS Go Into Your Dance Warner Brothers 1935 directed by Archie L. Mayo with choreography by Bobby Connolly is a flimsy but highly entertaining showbiz musical that became the only film collaboration of the Jolsons Al and Ruby Keeler. Like most Jolson movies of that period Go Into Your Dance starts off with good comedy and wisecracks and during its final half hour or so changes to melodrama. In spite of mood swings the changes don't hurt the continuity in any way. Jolson appears to be more at ease with his comical oneliners and is much improved here as an actor during the more serious moments. Keeler gets to sing one song but she gets plenty of opportunity to go into her dancing.Opening title BROADWAY The street of ups and downs where show business in 1935 was in top speed. Story Al Howard Al Jolson is an irresponsible and egotistic entertainer responsible for his Broadway shows closing by not appearing. Al's sister Molly Glenda Farrell comes to the Actors Equity Association with the assurance that this will be Al's last time that he will ever desert a show but she is told by the producers that he is through on Broadway. Molly manages to get her old friend Dorothy Wayne Ruby Keeler a dancer to team up with Al in hope her partnership with him will lead up to his comeback. Dorothy agrees and she and Al become successful for the next several months appearing at Brown's St. Ledger Roof Garden. While Al treats Dorothy like a kid and philanders with other women especially chorus girls Dorothy who resents being treated this way unwittingly falls in love with Al and decides to leave the act. Molly however persuades Dorothy to remain and soon arranges to hire Duke Hutchinson Barton MacLane an underworld financier to back Al's new night club engagement The Casino De Paree in New York. In the meantime Al who considers himself God's gift to women becomes entangled with Luana Wells Helen Morgan a blues singer who happens to be Duke's wife wanting to also make a comeback on Broadway by appearing at the Casino De Paree. Before opening night Al is told by Dorothy after receiving a phone call that his sister Molly is in jail for murder. Al must decide whether to take the show's 30000 to bail out Molly or go on with the show as planned. If he abandons this show the Duke will have his thugs awaiting for him outside.Patsy Kelly not mentioned in the above synopsis provides true comedy relief in appearing in three separate scenes with Jolson actually unrelated to the plot as if she were added in at the last minute to boost up some comedy. In spite all it helps the continuity along. Kelly is a laugh riot and not to be missed. Glenda Farrell featured as Jolson's sister known best for usually playing a wisecracking and fasttalking golddigger gets her chance on film to play a basically straight character. Farrell only has one scene that does involve comedy which takes place on a train where she encounters a British passenger Arthur Treacher after accidentally dipping him with ink. She even gets her chance to wear stylish wardrobes and fur coat.Great tunes by Harry Warren and Al Dubin include Cielito Lindo written by Elpidio Ramirez and sung in Spanish by Jolson A Good OldFashioned Cocktail sungdanced by Ruby Keeler and chorus Mammy I'll Sing About You Jolson About a Quarter to Nine Swanee River by Stephen Foster sung briefly by Jolson in blackface The Little Things You Used to Do sung by Helen Morgan Casino De Paree She's a Latin From Manhattan Go Into Your Dance and a reprise finish to About a Quarter to Nine all sung by Jolson. During a night club sequence earlier in the story there is an underscoring by a band to the tune 'Cause My Baby Says It's So but is never sung in the story. Possibly an intended song for this movie but scrapped before release. That song would finally be heard and fully introduced by Dick Powell in The Singing Marine Warners 1937. Also in the cast are Akim Tamiroff Sharon Lynn Phil Regan and Gordon Westcott. While Benny Rubin gets screen credit he has only a tiny bit at The Caliente. I did recognize former silent screen actress Mary Carr famous for sentimental mother roles in the twenties briefly scene as a wardrobe woman.Go Into Your Dance available on DVD and occasional viewing on Turner Classic Movies is 89 minutes of solid entertainment highly recommended as it is entertaining. And as Jolson would say whenever being truthful and sincere A word of a Howard. 12";

	schema:reviewBody "Go Into Your Dance is a significant film because it is the only one to star married couple Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler. The two have an odd relationship on the screen which seems to reflect their coupling offscreen. Who would have ever thought that a pompous jazz singer would marry an innocent chorus girl? Though their relationship was wrought with problems and eventually led to divorce it is one of the big romances of early Hollywood.Jolson stars as Al Howard a popular Broadway star who has neglected to show up to his own premieres one too many times he's sunk. His concerned sister Glenda Farrell does all she can to knock some sense into him and revive his career. Teaming him with a chorus dancer Keeler seems to do the trick but he fails to recognize how much his new partner loves him.Jolson is wonderful as always here. His personality is a bit flamboyant but he is still able to maintain his status as a romantic lead. His presence seems to have helped Keeler as well this is her best performance to date. There are times when you might catch yourself believing everything she says and getting wrapped up in her parts of the story. In previous films it seems all she had to do was be cute and dance but here acting kicks in. Farrell is a favorite of mine a sassy actress with a heart of gold. She peps up every film she's in and she's beautiful to boot. Also making appearances is Patsy Kelly in a small comic role and Helen Morgan as the girlfriend of a gangster with eyes for Al.The music is pretty good for such a forgotten film. Keeler is introduced in a simple chorus number called A Good Old Fashioned Cocktail that utilizes props and costume changes. Jolson gets to sing about his Mammy but his standout song is A Quarter to Nine an upbeat catchy song about anticipating a date. Morgan is outstanding singing an understated but powerful The Little Things You Used to Do. Latin From Manhattan is another catchy carefree song that should be better known. Last we have the title song Go Into Your Dance which is much more forgettable than the others.".

	schema:reviewBody "Taking a look at the screen credits of Ruby Keeler and you'll find that Go Into Your Dance is not only the only film she did with her husband Al Jolson but after five films her first away from Dick Powell. She did two more subsequent to Go Into Your Dance with Powell but after only one more film at Warner Brothers she only made three more prior to retiring from the screen and settling down as wife and mother. Of course Keeler did make a comeback in the Sixties and I well remember seeing her and Patsy Kelly in that Broadway revival of No No Nanette.What Go Into Your Dance really was meant to do is try to save the Jolsons marriage which was in free fall by then. Al's egomania didn't make him the easiest person to live with and within a few years Keeler called it quits. For the rest of her life she would never answer one question about life with Jolson.Warner Brothers did assemble a good cast for them. Al plays an irresponsible egomaniacal entertainer no stretch in the casting department. He's walked out on too many a show as his sister Glenda Farrell tells him no producer will hire him. Never mind says Jolie he'll produce his own with a new dancer he's discovered Ruby Keeler.Producing costs money and that means going to gangster Barton MacLane whose trampy wife wants to resume her show business career. Jolie gets the money and the wife played by Helen Morgan. But his problems are only beginning.Bobby Connolly did the dance direction and I have to say pinch hit admirably for Busby Berkeley. The big hit song of the film was Jolson singing and Keeler dancing to About a Quarter to Nine. It was nicely staged and worthy of Berkeley in every sense of the word as Berkeley gave Jolson that awful Going' to Heaven on a Mule in Wonder Bar. In this film the chorus of male dancers and Jolson all turn to blackface for a minute. Jolson also does the finale title song in blackface as well.Unfortunately not only does Jolson do blackface but in this film not once but twice he rubs the head of black actor Fred Snowflake Toone for good luck. That particular bit of tastelessness kept Go Into Your Dance off the television screens for decades. I remember seeing it on WOR TV's million dollar movie as a lad in the Fifties but never again until recently.The real pity is that we were also deprived of seeing Helen Morgan sing as well. Her alcoholism had gotten pretty bad at this point but she was one of Broadway brightest stars. She sings The Little Things You Used to Do in her typical poignant fashion. It would have really been great to see her costar with Jolson in a film but that was not to be.Go Into Your Dance is quite a museum piece of a film and if you're not into Jolson I would urge you to see it for Helen Morgan.".

'About A Quarter To Nine' is particularly memorable as it slips seamlessly from a bar to a big stage number with some complicated for its time 'optical' effects.

Unfortunately 'A Good Old Fashioned Cocktail' is slightly interrupted as Al Howard chats up a tall goodlooking showgirl during the performance.The film is of particular interest as Jolson shares the screen with his reallife wife Ruby Keeler. For those who have watched The Jolson Story starring Larry Parks it might come as a surprise to realise that Ruby Keeler was nothing like 'Julie Benson' who Jolson marries in the 'biopic'. Of course the Jolson Story was a great musical in its own right but should not be viewed as historically accurate.Despite the good music the 'blackface' sequences are not comfortable and now belong to a bygone age. It's interesting to consider that in the history of blackface performance in the UK the BBC continued to run 'The Black and White Minstrel Show' until 1978. Also distinctly uncomfortable is the sequence with Fred 'Snowflake' Toones as he was known playing the ever cheerful but obsequious valet. If you look him up on the IMDb website you'll be amazed at how many films he was in  almost all uncredited.In the end this is a fascinating piece of cinema history with some excellent songs and performances. However I suspect that it's for the reasons given that this film is not often seen these days.".

Yet I remember them from watching the old Warner Brothers cartoons when I was a kid. It was great finally seeing where they actually came from. I only wish that Go Into Your Dance was available on DVD.";

As noted by others it's a typical Jolson plot less maudlin than most others except at the close when Ruby Keeler does a neardeath scene. Well at least she was a firstrate tap dancer. I couldn't help noticing that in this film Jolson's character is called the world's greatest entertainer. Ruby Keeler his wife for seven or eight years is said to have remarked I know he was the world's greatest entertainer he told me so every day. Incidentally in my film history course I always included the Jolson night club number from The Jazz Singer. Even the younger generation was impressed by the way his dynamic personality almost jumps off the screen perhaps that was the screen appearance that showed him off to best advantage at the peak of his Broadway career.".

After all he plays a successful Broadway star what a stretch! who is a jerk. Again and again when he has a successful show he gets bored and simply walks away...leaving everyone in a lurch. This makes his character a seriously bad person...leaving backers and actors to be ruined simply because he gets bored! Well by the time this film starts he's once again disappeared and is down in Mexico having a good time...and he's burned about every possible bridge. So when he has an idea about putting on a new show backers are naturally unexcited about it. And this gets me to the HUGE problem with the film...the audience watching this picture also feels the same wayAl is a jerk and you DON'T want to see him succeed. Why would Jolson agree to make this film as it makes him look awful...just as terrible as the guy Ruby Keeler used to say he was like off stage!?What you get in this film is pretty much what you'd expect otherwise. Jolson sings a lot and there are a lot of production numbers. And unfortunately Al gets the break he simply doesn't deserve. But what does he do with it? See the film.I noticed that I am one of the few reviewers who thought the movie was fatally flawed. Obviously the other viewers could look past Al's nasty history of ditching shows because he got bored. They also apparently could look past Jolson doing a blackface number something he was famous for over the course of his career. As for me the film was a decent timepasser and no more. It did end well and got better as the film progressed. I also noticed that a lot of the actors yelled their linesparticularly Barton MacLane and Ruby Keeler. Oddly Patsy Kelly didn't!".

Fred Toones is also obnoxious and the film has a point around the halfway mark where it drags to just before the final production number.However 'Go Into Your Dance' is a goodlooking film and nicely directed. The songs are very tuneful and at their best great the highlight being About a Quarter to Nine with She's a Latin in Manhattan close behind. Surprisingly good are the choreography and dancing have often been indifferent to Bobby Conolly but he does a great job here with the final production number being particularly imaginative and energetic.Keeler is very charming and likable even if her dancing is not always great. Helen Morgan knocks it out the park with her powerful rendition of The Little Things You Used to Do and Patsy Kelly is a lot of fun.

	schema:headline " Ayoade makes one of the finest debuts in years.";
	schema:reviewBody "There's nothing better than walking into a screen to see the debut film by a writer and director  one that you have only heard very little about  and walking away 90 minutes later feeling more moved entertained and uplifted by a movie than you have been in years.Perhaps cinemagoers in the mid 1990s had this experience upon seeing Wes Anderson's first film Bottle Rocket. And maybe even those who witnessed Spike Jonze's big screen debut Being John Malkovich only a few years later will understand it too. However for those of you who like me were too young to witness the birth of these auteurs of independent cinema then you don't have to worry because Richard Ayoade's film Submarine is almost as good as both of them put together.It tells the story of Oliver Tate who is caught at the junction between childhood and adulthood as he struggles with his first feelings of love desire heartbreak and must choose what path he wishes to take that'll define who he is for the rest of his life.Sure it may sound somewhat similar to all the comingofage stories that have hit the cinema recently but what makes Submarine so special is Richard Ayoade's ability to capture the essence of growing up the joy the optimism and the tenderness alongside all the angst confusion and depression too. I defy anyone to not see themselves plastered up on that silver screen in the film's opening as Oliver fantasises about the adoration and attention he'd receive if he died.The ups and downs of this British comedy are mainly due to Ayoade's wonderful screenplay and direction that are touching yet never slip into sentimentality  he often playfully pokes fun at it in many cases  but what also deserves credit are the poignant score by Arctic Monkey's singer Alex Turner the cinematography that effortlessly shifts between comic framing and beautiful imagery and the noteperfect performances by the entire cast.Craig Roberts plays Oliver Tate in a starmaking performance that will surely see him become one of Britain's finest young actors in the next few years. His character is a complex multifaceted one yet he is able to make it wholly believable. Similarly outstanding is Yasmin Page as his love interest Jordana. It's essential to the story that she is a mystery to Oliver for much of Submarine's opening half only revealing the reasons why she is so rebellious unromantic and mischievous in the final act and Page brilliantly portrays this with a careful mix of enigma seductiveness and humanity.What also excels Ayoade's film from being just another British coming of age story is the stylishness of his direction. Presented in the fashion of a French New Wave film like Jules Et Jim or A Bout De Souffl he gives Submarine an aurora of quirkiness and creativity that you rarely find in British cinema. The kitchen sink is gone and has been replaced by jump cuts inventive sound design and a somewhat disjointedness.This style moreover helps to complement the personality of our aforementioned protagonist who sees the world in a unique way to everyone else.So what lies in the future for British cinema? Some could argue that it's the big dramas like The King's Speech others could argue that it's the low budget affairs like Monsters and many will say that it's spectacles like Harry Potter. However on the evidence that Richard Ayoade presents here Submarine might just be a glimpse of the great things to come.".

Although thankful that America has not yet invaded his country Oliver informs us that this is an important film which we should treat with the utmost respect.Don't worry it's okay to laugh you're supposed to. This is a teen comingofage comedy. Oliver Tate Craig Roberts is like a young Welsh hero of a Wes Anderson film. Gangly and awkward he struggles with popularity in school but when he imagines his own funeral the entire country mourns. He bullies one girl to try and impress another but then writes a long letter not so much repenting his guilt but teaching her how to be cool. The dialogue like Oliver is precocious but hilarious with a surprisingly fresh feel considering how tired the genre has become.Oliver tries to win the girl and become the best boyfriend in the world and he also has to be the best son in the world to save his parents' marriage. In both adventures he uses psychology books usually found in routine searches of his parents' bedroom to ensure his actions accurately reflect his intentions. If you can guess how his plans may go awry then you are the right audience for this very funny film.His father Lloyd Noah Taylor is a depressed marine biologist while his mother Jill Sally Hawkins is inappropriately attracted to their neighbour an old boyfriend of hers. He's a mystic theatrical performer and Oliver and Lloyd are the only ones that see it for the nonsense that it is. Lloyd is like a grownup Welsh hero of a Wes Anderson film and I loved how they included the father of the protagonist as a main character and showed that although he was more mature still not any more in tune with the ways of the world around him.It has some slightly dark twists but Submarine succeeds because it never lets up the humour or the quirky tone. Funny? Yes. Important? No but I certainly get the joke.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. A UK version of a teen comedy is quite a different experience than a US teen comedy. Maybe it's the source material from Joe Dunthorne's novel or maybe it's the deft touch of first time director Richard Ayoade. Either way there is much more depth and emotion involved here ... not just sight gags.The two leads are Craig Roberts as Oliver and Yasmin Paige as Jordana. Watching the way these two work so hard at not appearing to like each other perfectly captures the teen dance. Once they do get together the film does a nice job of creating those perfect moments of doubt discovery and subtle humiliation.Oliver is carrying quite the burden. He strives to be the perfect boyfriend but is also very concerned about the slow collapse of his parents' marriage. This problem is enhanced when his mom's old lover moves in across the street. Graham Purvis is some selfproclaimed mystic healer who somehow gets people to pay attention to his words despite driving around town in a van with his face painted on the side.Oliver's parents are played by Noah Taylor and Sally Hawkins. Taylor is superb as the quietly suffering loner who has no concept of what makes a relationship. Hawkins is the disillusioned wife eager to recapture the magic of her youth ... even if it is with a goofball mystic played by Paddy Considine.I have to point out that Craig Roberts who plays Oliver is the spitting image of a young Bud Cort ... and even has some of Cort's mannerisms from the classic Harold and Maude. Mostly Oliver and Jordana are just two regular teenagers fighting angst depression and selfdoubt not to mention REAL issues like disinterested parents and a very sick mother. Turns out being a teen is every bit as tough in the UK as it is in the US ... but the dialogue is much better!".

Maybe it's the source material from Joe Dunthorne's novel or maybe it's the deft touch of first time director Richard Ayoade. Either way there is much more depth and emotion involved here ... not just sight gags.The two leads are Craig Roberts as Oliver and Yasmin Paige as Jordana. Watching the way these two work so hard at not appearing to like each other perfectly captures the teen dance. Once they do get together the film does a nice job of creating those perfect moments of doubt discovery and subtle humiliation.Oliver is carrying quite the burden. He strives to be the perfect boyfriend but is also very concerned about the slow collapse of his parents' marriage. This problem is enhanced when his mom's old lover moves in across the street. Graham Purvis is some selfproclaimed mystic healer who somehow gets people to pay attention to his words despite driving around town in a van with his face painted on the side.Oliver's parents are played by Noah Taylor and Sally Hawkins. Taylor is superb as the quietly suffering loner who has no concept of what makes a relationship. Hawkins is the disillusioned wife eager to recapture the magic of her youth ... even if it is with a goofball mystic played by Paddy Considine.I have to point out that Craig Roberts who plays Oliver is the spitting image of a young Bud Cort ... and even has some of Cort's mannerisms from the classic Harold and Maude. Mostly Oliver and Jordana are just two regular teenagers fighting angst depression and selfdoubt not to mention REAL issues like disinterested parents and a very sick mother. Turns out being a teen is every bit as tough in the UK as it is in the US ... but the dialogue is much better!";

There were some slightly Adrian Moleesque moments but that's not a bad thing. The audience at the screening seemed to think that the whole thing was a riproaring comedy and laughed at points which were obviously supposed to be more poignant or sad. Overall however the tone is one of wry comedy at the horrors of growing up and even subjects such as brain tumors  divorce are treated as lightly heartedly as possible.Don't be put off that Ben Stiller's production company was behind funding the film  it has nothing in common with a Hollywood teen movie. One of the best British films we have seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whilst watching Richard Ayoade playing ubernerd Moss in the hitand miss sitcom The IT Crowd or playing TV producer and actor Dean Lerner in the criminally underrated Garth Merenghi's Darkplace the last thing I pictured him doing was confidently directing a featurelength film. I don't mean to knock him as I've always felt he was an extremely talented comedy performer and writer and he brightens up whatever he appears in no matter how crap the material. But here he has focused all his ambition influences and talent into creating a truly memorable debut.Tate Craig Roberts a strange intelligent and unnervingly confident schoolboy who falls for an equally strange girl Jordana Yasmin Paige. After an incident which sees Oliver reluctantly participate in a spot of casual bullying that causes a girl to fall into a muddy pond Oliver and Jordana begin their unusual romance. All seems to be going well until Oliver suspects his mother Jill Sally Hawkins of having an affair with cheesy selfhelp guru Graham Paddy Considine who lives next door. His father Lloyd Noah Taylor is so passive and uncaring that he is practically a zombie and so Oliver takes it upon himself to rescue his parent's broken marriage whilst holding his own fragile relationship together.The film arrives amidst critical praise and festival wordofmouth and the promise of a real future talent in director Richard Ayoade. I'm pleased to announce that the film is every bit as good as I've heard. I had my doubts concerned with the film's 'quirky indie comedy' tag that films are so lazily lumbered with these days. But while the film is quirky indie and a comedy it finds its influences lying elsewhere  from the greatest of all film movements the French New Wave. From the start this is clear with the Godardesque large lettering with strong colours for the opening credits and title cards. Everything about the film screams New Wave from its stylistic boldness selfawareness and even the unconventionally handsome and turtleneckwearing leading man.One of the main strengths of the film is it's awareness of slipping into clich. The quirkiness and magic of the French New Wave have been copied and rippedoff so often that nowadays when it is used it can come across as pretentious. But Oliver's intelligence and amusing voiceover frequently touches on this. At the start of his relationship with Jordana they spend their days on the beach and frequenting industrial wastelands and Oliver comments that he will put these moments in his 'Super 8 memories' cue shots of the couple running and laughing on the beach shot in that grainy homevideo look. He also fantasises that he is in a film and that the film will end up with him searching for Jordana on a beach and how it will end in an artyfarty pretentious manner aimed to encourage discussion among chinstrokers. It's a great little trick and you have to admire the film's refreshing self assurance.The film is also very very funny with Craig Roberts proving an extremely talented comedy performer all paleskinned wideeyed awkwardness and a pronounced high pitched voice that almost resembles many of Ayoade's TV characters. The humour is often similar in style to Wes Anderson's dare I say it? indie comedies which are some of the best comedies if not films to come out in the last fifteen years. Most of the humour stems from Oliver's increasing desperation to lose his virginity to Jordana especially in one scene where they find themselves home alone only for Oliver to light candles around his bed and lie openlegged on his side in a cheesy pose. Jordana with her eyes closed waiting for the surprise opens them and deadpans 'fn' hell you're a serial killer.'A real gem and a film that definitely introduces the potentially massive talent of director Richard Ayoade star Craig Roberts and Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner who performs the wonderful music. And also a rare opportunity to see some of the beautiful sights of Swansea where I currently reside.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Quirky unlikeable protagonist populates neat Welsh urban landscape served up by talented UK firsttime director";
	schema:reviewBody "If you're a fan of quirky indie films such as 'Harold and Maude' or anything by quirky indie director Wes Anderson then firsttime director Richard Ayoade's 'Submarine' is for you. As for the rest of us better to find something more rooted in a sensible historical reality. This is not to say that Mr. Ayoade is not without talent. His background is in music video as well as being well known for his comic performance on a British TV show 'The IT Crowd'. Ayoade does wonders with the camera turning his Welsh urban landscape into a veritable palette of most inviting sights and sounds.Unfortunately Ayoade drew his inspiration from the 2008 novel of the same name by Joe Dunthorne. While I haven't read the novel I'm told that the film sticks fairly closely to the novel's plot which features the unlikeable protagonist Oliver Tate played by Craig Roberts who bears a striking resemblance to another famous quirky character Bud Cort of 'Harold and Maude' fame. Roberts has Oliver offering up an almost deadpan monosyllabic delivery throughout the film which some may find to be cool or amusing but for me it's symptomatic of Submarine's overall monotonous tone.Submarine's main problem is that it's protagonist Oliver is not endearing at all. Most 'comingofage' stories feature protagonists who are basically good people with one characteristic flaw. In Oliver's case it's the opposite most of his actions are cruel and he fails to have his grand epiphany until the film's denouement.Set in the mid80s in Wales we're introduced to Oliver as he's fantasizing what his community's response would be had he passed away at his current age of fifteen. If that isn't morbid enough it gets worse when Oliver decides to impress Jordana a schoolmate he has a crush on by bullying another overweight schoolmate Zoe who ends up falling into a pond as a result of Oliver's taunts. To make matters worse Oliver types up a manual for Zoe advising her how not to be a victim and delivers it to her only friend only to discover that Zoe has left school and moved as a result of all the bullying.Oliver and Jordana become victims of bullying themselves after Jordana takes Polaroid pictures of Oliver and her kissing and distributes them to classmates in order to make an exboyfriend jealous. As a result of their new found isolation the two become closer. While wellintentioned Oliver's continuous clueless actions cannot be excused because he's old enough to know right from wrong. At one point after reading a book that offers the opinion that children are able to cope with death better as a result of experiencing the death of their own pets Oliver considers poisoning Jordana's dog so that she can cope with her mother's impending death from a recent terminal cancer diagnosis. Oliver alienates Jordana further when he decides it's a better idea to leave Jordana alone as she copes with her stricken mother in the hospital.The second part of the 'Submarine' plot involves Oliver's suspicions that his mother has been having an affair with nextdoor neighbor Graham Purvis a newage Guru who peddles a wacky 'system' involving emotions and the color spectrum. Oliver's Dad is a depressed marine biologist who hardly seems upset when Oliver informs him that his mother might be having an affair. Oliver engages in the creepy surveillance of his mother and Graham at a New Year's Eve party at the beach. Later he spies Graham and his mother entering Graham's trailer together and assumes the worst. There's more bad conduct from Oliver when he gets drunk and attempts to trash Graham's home before passing out.It's supposed to be funny when Oliver's parents coddle the wayward Oliver after the breakin as well as the mother admitting that she gave Graham a 'hand job' but at the same time indicating that she and her husband were reconciling remember anything can happen in a movie with 'quirky' characters!.After all of Oliver's troublesome conduct during the film director Ayoade wants us to conclude that youths will be youths. Somehow all the bad behavior is not so bad after all since clueless Oliver was wellintentioned at the same time. Oliver's 'reward' at film's end is the implied reconciliation with love interest Jordana. But there is little remorse from Oliver who really needs to make up for all his bad conduct especially the bullying he engaged in with his formerly besieged and ostracized classmate.For all those who are enamored with these type of films featuring 'quirky' characters I can only point out that they seem to operate in their own separate but dubious moral universe. Admire 'Submarine' for its neat cinematography and clever editing but please recognize that such tomes add nothing to the pantheon of true art house fare.".

Oliver's Dad is a depressed marine biologist who hardly seems upset when Oliver informs him that his mother might be having an affair. Oliver engages in the creepy surveillance of his mother and Graham at a New Year's Eve party at the beach. Later he spies Graham and his mother entering Graham's trailer together and assumes the worst. There's more bad conduct from Oliver when he gets drunk and attempts to trash Graham's home before passing out.It's supposed to be funny when Oliver's parents coddle the wayward Oliver after the breakin as well as the mother admitting that she gave Graham a 'hand job' but at the same time indicating that she and her husband were reconciling remember anything can happen in a movie with 'quirky' characters!.After all of Oliver's troublesome conduct during the film director Ayoade wants us to conclude that youths will be youths. Somehow all the bad behavior is not so bad after all since clueless Oliver was wellintentioned at the same time. Oliver's 'reward' at film's end is the implied reconciliation with love interest Jordana. But there is little remorse from Oliver who really needs to make up for all his bad conduct especially the bullying he engaged in with his formerly besieged and ostracized classmate.For all those who are enamored with these type of films featuring 'quirky' characters I can only point out that they seem to operate in their own separate but dubious moral universe. Admire 'Submarine' for its neat cinematography and clever editing but please recognize that such tomes add nothing to the pantheon of true art house fare.";

Oliver is a bit of an oddball but he is beset by the usual adolescent angst over sex and a good part of the movie deals with his developing relationship with Jordana a bit of an odd duck herself. These two are likable even though they are not idealizedfor example Jordana enjoys bullying a frumpy classmate and involves Oliver in the practice. Of course Oliver regrets it sensitive lad that he is. In fact he sends the girl a note giving two hints on how to stand up to bullying own any embarrassment and silently endure whatever torture is handed out. I suppose his ill advice comes from his immaturity but I found this aspect of the movie disturbing.This is filmed in southern Wales and there is no attempt to glamorize the industrial backdropin fact the two protagonists seek it out as a sort of antiromantic rebellion. Someone will enjoy this movie based in large part on how much he or she likes the two young actors. Their emotional ups and downs are standard fare perhaps that is why I did like them. The movie captures how intensely adolescents feel about their experiences and thoughts.The fact that Oliver's parents are presented as real people and not as dopes to be ridiculed by the adolescents is a distinguishing feature. Oliver's father Lloyd suffers from depression but he still functions and as played by Noah Taylor in a deadpan style he provides some humor. Interesting to note that in his younger days Taylor played the young man in the excellent Australian coming of age films The Year My Voice Broke and Flirting. Oliver's mother is starved for affection and a brighter life and begins an affair with a neighbor who is a spiritual guru perhaps too facilely written for satirical purposes. Oliver sizes up the situation with his parents pretty accurately and endeavors to bring them back to a happier life. Oliver's concern for his parents is touching.In many movies in this genre there is a continual tease about the possibility of the young couple having sex. This movie lets Oliver and Jordana have sex without moralizing. Parents may not like this.I'm not sure how much this movie adds to the canon of coming of age stories but its gentle humor and sympathetic characters made it enjoyable for me.".

The main character who provides a lot of voice over narration is Oliver Tate a 15 year old high school student who is quite adept at analyzing his popularity status and various options in wooing girls. The film has a Rushmore vibe but Oliver Tate is no Max Fischer. The majority of the plot is an ellipsis around two poles Oliver nurtures the beginnings of a relationship with the feisty Jordana and he suspects his mother of infidelity with the new next door neighbor who wears black leather pants and proclaims himself a mystic. Oliver does not balance these two 'problems' very well and the pole involving his mother's suspected infidelity feels forced and trite. I do not recognize the two actors who play Oliver and Jordana Craig Roberts and Yasmin Paige but I suppose if you watch TV in Britain you will. The poster has a large Ben Stiller Presents at the top of it so the film has starbacking and I even think he makes a cameo but it would be very hard to see him. Submarine is slated for a 10 June U.S. release but I am not recommending this movie go watch Rushmore again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Teenage angst is a theme covered by many and conquered by none within the cinematic landscape of the 21st century. Modern teenage romances exist only as pixelated words darting between computers and phones and never as emotional connections between human beings their brief lives just a fleeting memory to the tortured souls of the two in question. So when a modern film comes forth fronting a hauntingly real take on life coexisting with romance many would usually run a mile. This is why Submarine is so unique and un flinching in its presentation it was made not to dictate but to reminisce to inspire to harness belief.As previously said this is not a romance film nor is it a love story it's a charming tale of a young boy's brush with its radiant thorns and the repercussions it has within his mentally aged mind. A charming tale brought to life by former sitcomstar Richard Ayoade an unexpected triumph both on paper and behind the camera. His lightyetreal approach to Joe Dunthorne's novel is simply majestic to watch his artful touches shining through the lens and his playful British humour echoing through the words.It is both the fantastic performances and Dunthorne's sweet sincere characters that the film rests upon like an unmovable block of unbroken laughter dramatically and comedically they are perfect. Craig Roberts' portrayal of the odd and pretentious teen Oliver Tate will surely never melt the hearts of the audience his creepy involvement with his parents' relationship giving him eerie edge but will capture their thoughts in a state of nostalgia and inspiration. His heartfelt voiceovers fill the picture with truth and his exaggerated weirdness is a sign of humanity and indifference among the many highlighting his alienation and truly bringing him into the centre of the entire story allowing him to never be overtaken by Sally Hawkins' emotionally forgiving mother or Paddy Considine's deluded dancer.There are no heroes within the piece but a horde of underappreciated and rarely recognised talent that fit so beautifully together like an artfully complacent jigsaw. Dunthorne's material is so firmly polished and his characters so lovably believable and Ayoade's distinct artistic style although owing to the likes of Mike Nichols and Woody Allen as well as the French newwave scene is a giant leap into cinematic originality. He truly has created something wonderful.Submarine is a unique and telling tale of teenage life possibly the most truthful ever filmed and Ayoade's fitting involvement allows it to be carefully broadcast into the minds of the many unspoilt and emotionally aware in its presentation. It's appeal will spread from similarly precocious teenagers to nostalgic seniors thanks to the nottodistantpast setting yanking away the technological nightmares that lay within modern romance and leaving behind the barebones of true life with love.In short it's a triumphantly humorous and truthful take on young life with artful touches and is the best most honest British film for a long long time.".

He truly has created something wonderful.Submarine is a unique and telling tale of teenage life possibly the most truthful ever filmed and Ayoade's fitting involvement allows it to be carefully broadcast into the minds of the many unspoilt and emotionally aware in its presentation. It's appeal will spread from similarly precocious teenagers to nostalgic seniors thanks to the nottodistantpast setting yanking away the technological nightmares that lay within modern romance and leaving behind the barebones of true life with love.In short it's a triumphantly humorous and truthful take on young life with artful touches and is the best most honest British film for a long long time.";

	schema:headline " Threequarters of a great indie film";
	schema:reviewBody "Oliver Tate Craig Roberts is a Swansea schoolboy with a wild imagination and a desire to be important. He imagines the response at his school if he died with students openly weeping. He also spies on his parents Lloyd Noah Taylor and Jill Sally Hawkins regularly. He's worried that they might be falling apart. At school he catches the attention of a girl that he likes Jordana Yasmin Paige by bullying another student. When someone starts picking on him though he nobly refuses to say something nasty about Jordana in front of the school. They start dating each other and Oliver holds high expectations for their relationship. He also becomes increasingly convinced that his mother is having an affair with their ninja neighbour Graham Paddy Considine who is an exboyfriend of Jill and also a motivational speaker. Oliver is determined to resolve his parents' marriage problems himself. Submarine written and directed by Richard Ayoade from Joe Dunthorne's novel is threequarters of a great indie film. This is a sharply observed black comedy and coming of age story built from great energy and a script that is brimming with clever details. The centrepiece of this film is the creation of this bizarre nosey and selfabsorbed teenager. And what a clever creation Oliver Tate is. He's such a fun character and a perfect vessel for the film's entirely quirky and very cynical dialogue. The hysterical opening vision of students lighting candles in remembrance of his hypothetical death perfectly visualises the bizarre and hilarious mind of this egotistical and obsessive protagonist. That was one of the most unexpected original moments and that made me laugh a lot. There are so many quotable lines and memorable little quirks like the way Oliver measures his parent's love life by how much they've turned the light switch or when he describes his pipe and hat phases. It can gently nudge everyday life for people in this community because Ayoade has great eyes and ears for personality. I love all the attention he applies to all of his characters not just the protagonist. Lloyd is for example a biologist who remembers random facts like the exact depth of the ocean and in the family dining room you'll notice the huge fish tank. There's also a funny moment where Oliver remembers his dad spoiling every Christmas by saying what the presents are before someone has unwrapped them. All of the jokes here are smart because they have the purpose of building character. It is a shame that we're only gifted so many intelligent comedies like this a year.There's more than a hint of Wes Anderson about the film and coincidentally Ben Stiller is credited as one of the film's executive producers. This film doesn't need to 'wink' with its humour. It's confident in relying on its own quirkiness and straightfaced deadpan mood to provide us with the laughs. With so many big laughs in the first half I wished the film was more consistent particularly in its final quarter. The cracks in the script's structure appear as the film mistakenly introduces a belated subplot involving Jordana's sick mother. It's at this point that the pacing and some of the laughs slump too. Dramatically not a lot happens in the film either which is partially its point but it also means that some of the climaxes feel very contained. Nevertheless the film treats you to a great example of deadpan acting. The comic timing of Craig Roberts in this film is brilliant. His character is selfimportant and selfabsorb but he still has heart. He just has to learn that he doesn't need to solve everything himself. Noah Taylor is also wonderfully reserved as the droopy faced Lloyd. One of his funniest scenes is when he tries to give his son dating advice and then provides him with a double sided cassette of songs to listen to one for the good times and the other side for the eventual breakup. These actors have been finely directed by Ayoade to be in sync with the films controlled tone. Even though this is a small and imperfect film I hope a lot of people see it for its wit its humour and its imagination.".

At first I wondered aloud 'how bad can it be'. After all how often does the common public agree with the harsh words of a critic.  Besides Pacino and Walken in the same film should be enough to generate even one star out of even the sternest critic right.  Right?Gigli is about two unbelievable gangsters who are assigned the task of kidnapping and watching over a prosecutors mentally challenged brother while also keeping an open eye on each other to ensure the success of the operation.  Ben plays Gigli an accent challenged goon who is as believable as Madonna in a nuns uniform and Jennifer plays Ricky a lesbian gangster who is primarily hired to ensure that Gigli doesn't screw things up.Along the way plenty of bit characters and ridiculous side plots stymie the progress of the mission.  Ricky has an exlover show up at the house and attempt suicide the gangsters ask for the thumb of the prisoner sent to the prosecutor Gigli has to rush to his mothers house and learns that good ole ma knows all about lesbians and throughout the film we are constantly annoyed by conversations between Gigli and his crime boss Lenny over the phone. I could go on but what's the point.Gigli was one of the worst reviewed films of 2003.  So I began to wonder why this film in particular ended up on everyone's poop list even though there were plenty of worse films people were throwing good money at Boat Trip Bad Boys II Masked and Anonymous.    The answer became pretty obvious. Nothing was expected of these other entries but Gigli had the star power of the two most talked about celebrities in Tinseltown.  Throw in director Martin Brest who has had incredible success with Scent of a Woman Midnight Run and Beverley Hills Cop and sprinkle in the veteran alist power of Christopher Walken and Al Pacino.  With a recipe as rich as these ingredients suggest one's expectations are set to a higher standard. Gigli simply does not deliver the goods.  The dialogue is so laughable that you expect this film to have midnight showings a la Rocky Horror Picture Show in the next ten years and the characters are so eccentrically hysterical that you can't help but cringe in your seat in embarrassment for all those involved.So now back to the critics.  We owe you an apology.  Most of the year we read your reviews and chastise your opinions but every once and a while a consensus amongst your peers keeps us from going in mass and spending our hard earned dollars on crap like this.  A 6 million dollar domestic take for Gigli is an example of the power that you possess and for that I will keep reading.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie and hated about 99 of it. After I found out it cost 54000000 to make I started to hate the other 1. If this is considered a love story between Lopez and Affleck may I ask...where was the love? A sex scene with no nudity no passion and no sound....why? Supporting characters like Christopher Walken and others were introduced and went no where...why? The story alone peeks when Pacino arrives and shoots one of the cast members.

The audience is not going to care if the actors in the movie learn something or progress if they don't care about the characters. Lopez and Affleck's characters do not exist! Much like the ugly tattoos on Affleck's shoulder the movie was not fun to look at. In my opinion and I do not think I am wrong if Lopez had a small nude scene and  or the movie was done as an independent film for under 2 or 3 million Gigli would have been a giant success. Instead we are left to wonder....why?".

If this is considered a love story between Lopez and Affleck may I ask...where was the love? A sex scene with no nudity no passion and no sound....why? Supporting characters like Christopher Walken and others were introduced and went no where...why? The story alone peeks when Pacino arrives and shoots one of the cast members.

	schema:reviewBody "Smug and a selfadorned cinesophisticate I rented out Gigli with a friend ready to scrutinise it with the benefit of my enlightened view of film. It was going to be an hilarious two hours. I'd settled down in a very comfy armchair and had poured a glass of some Austrian glug. I couldn't wait to laugh at the stupid dialogue and that ridiculous script but the joke was on us because Gigli transcends the established limit of effective urine stealing. This is because its simply so horrible that you can forget trying to make yourself look intelligent and media literate by ripping the bladder evacuate because the scale of misguided conception baffles the mind and eventually shuts it down. It's like being hit by a sack full of bricks in the face for a full 114 minutes. There's a teasing little scene with JLo early on when she tells a bunch of unruly kids that there's a martial arts move that can gouge out the eyes and simultaneously destroy the visual cortex meaning that not only are you rendered blind but you'll never be able to remember anything you've seen. For the Gigli viewer this is like showing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to a hall packed with diabetics. You're left to ponder the short term agony weighed up against the long term benefit as Martin Brest's story unfolds with the principle characters of a unlikeable emotionally and sexually retarded thug with a soft centre a fat Affleck a lesbian who isn't really a lesbian because you can be converted to heterosexuality by an emotionally and sexually retarded thug and an actually retarded man who was probably supposed to be a Rainmantype character who redeems Affleck's arrogant meathead but is in fact a cringe inducing selfharm facilitating caricature of the mentally handicapped. Look many movies look good on paper and suffer from poor execution but what's head scratching about Gigli is that it's as dire on the page as it is on screen. Broadly it's supposed to be a romantic comedy sort of Out of Sight meets Rainman meets Whats New Pussycat? but it's stillborn as a criminal caper devoid of anything approaching sensitivity and has some of the worst battle of the sexes banter that ever crawled onto the screen. Brest who directed the dire 16 hour remake of Meet John Doe Meet Joe Black shows that when it comes to misjudging material he's peerless. His crimes here are compounded by the fact that this is his own script. That script incidentally is a roll call of on screen horror. Witness if you can the Penis Vs. Vagina scene in which Affleck argues the case for the male genitals or the tear jerking moment in which the soft hearted Affleck having given the Mentally Handicapped Brian relationship advice looks on like a proud father as his new friends woos an Australian bombshell during the filming of a Baywatch beach party. You'll envy the man who gets his brains blown out and eaten by goldfish or the horrendous girlfriend of JLo who having realised which film she's in slits her wrists...stupidly the wrong way. Once its all over and you sit there open mouthed you're left to briefly ponder why Brest did it. Did the kidnapped brother have to be disabled? Surely there must have been a more effective way of facilitating Affleck's transition from idiot to slightly more compassionate idiot? Did JLo have to be a Lesbian? Sure Affleck has to have some obstacles toward getting the girl and we all like a bit of sexual tension but gay viewers must have been flabbergasted that a man who describes men and women as the bull and the cow and does lovable things like warmly looking vacuous and endearingly been obnoxious should persuade a woman to er hop over the fence. And even if Brest was blinded by his own vanity what in the name of Beverly Hills Cop persuaded Christopher Walken and Al Pacino to cameo? None of it makes any sense. The bottle of wine I had with the film was good though but by the time I regained consciousness the bit left in the bottle was undrinkable.".

His amorous approaches towards her are rejected when she tells him she is a lesbian but the two have bigger problems with the job itself.I rented this film because I had read all the harsh reviews both professional and on this site that just ripped into it and seemed to have more personal vendettas against the stars rather than objective points to make about the film.  With this in mind I decided that I would have to check it out myself I have no personal feelings about Lopez and Affleck  their relationship is not something I have had rammed down my throat as I don't read the gossips mags and my paper of choice is the Times where they get rather limited coverage.  Without this fatigue I was able to view the film as it came to me rather than seething with cruel and clever put downs even before the film started as some critics clearly did.However the critics were mostly right even if they overreacted to the extreme.  The film starts reasonably well and you can see the potential or at least you can see what they were thinking when the film was being put together.  Sadly as the film continues the thin strands holding it together are slowly unravelling until almost nothing is left of value. Some of it works well how many times have the audience embraced a comic crime caper with hit men in the lead roles?  Here the film does have some of that type of humour particularly in the jokes about Gigli's masculinity but the music used to set the tone begins to grate after a while because there is nothing to support it and everything else is flawed.The main plot is so very full of holes and stupid plot devices that it is difficult to be involved by it.  For a crime comedy the plot doesn't need to be perfect  but it needs to be good enough so that it doesn't take away from the film here it is so weak that it damages the film at it's core. The other side of the plot is the romance and it is absurd!  I'm sure if I were a lesbian that I would be offended by the I'll turn her' approach of the film but I'm not so I'll leave that for others to debate.  However the romance between the two is unrealistic and uninvolving the lesbian thing just makes it worse.The characters themselves are poor.  Neither Gigli or Ricki ever seem like killers  in fact even a hint of violence and they look terrified and out of their depth.  His personality seems to change to whatever the scene requires one moment impatient the next sensitive the next angry while Ricki is just sweetness and light.  Affleck and Lopez must take almost all the blame for this their performances are as misjudged and lacking as the script. Affleck is actually not that bad  he is willing to send himself up it is the jumping script that makes him appear to be all over the place.  Lopez is awful someone who has done this crime comedy style movie before should have been much better but she acts like she is in a simpering romcom.  What is surprising is just how little chemistry the two have considering they are a couple now they just don't do the job at all.Bartha gives a dumb Rain Man impression to the point where I kept expecting him to say I'm an excellent driver'.  His character is just a joke and I even wished for Lopez to come onto the screen whenever he was on  at least I could just stare at her body and ignore him!  The two main cameos are actually very good but unfortunately serve to show up the rest of the film. Walken is good but his character appears and disappears without reason Pacino is much better simply because he does his menacing wooha' thing and is very effective.Overall this is not the worst film ever made' those who tell you that have clearly have a limited viewing experience many of the reviews were made harsher by the back lash against the whole Bennifer thing.  However that's not to say they are wrong  only overly harsh.  The film is poorly judged in almost every aspect and is too hard to enjoy as a result.  Has about 3 good moments in it but it is an overwhelming shambles.".

	schema:reviewBody "You know how you get a Greatest Hits Album and there's a handful of good songs the ones you know and love and then the rest are stinkers? Filler just put there to pad out the time? That's basically like Gigli a movie that's not particularly good as a whole but has some knockout individual scenes.First off let's be honest...it's not as bad as we've been led to believe. Look at the message board  more and more people are admitting it's not that bad. Not exactly praise but considering SO many people voted this into the Bottom 100 it's at 29 when I wrote this I think it's safe to say most of those were just padded votes mainly from people who wanted to hate this movie and hated the whole Bennifer thing. Ebert gave it mild thumbs down and said he was deluged with hate mail complaining how he didn't hate it ENOUGH. Gimme a break.OK the plot is awful. No bones about that. In case you don't know here it is A mafia hitman kidnap's a DA's retarded brother so the case won't go to trial. He's a notorious screwup so the mob sends a 2nd hitman who's a lesbian and looks like a supermodel to make sure Hitman 1 doesn't screw up. They sit around an apartment talking and debating. Random people show up and they have to hide the retarded kid. Every once in a while they go out for Mexican in a convertible with the top down!! What in the world?? And this was supposed to be a big summer movie? I suspect writerdirector Martin Brest came up for the storyline in a dream and for some reason thought it was a good idea. It's not. Watching this movie is akin to having an annoying roommate who keeps changing the channel between Rain Man Prizzi's Honor Chasing Amy a failed sitcom about hit men and any play with one set and no budget.Why do I kinda like this movie then? Same reason I dig Brest's Beverly Hills Cop  there's scenes in here that are to die for. I remember as a kid i'd rewind scenes in Beverly Hills Cop over and over again because I thought they were the funniest things ever. Same here. There's at least 3 or 4 awesome scenes and about 5 good ones as well. The rest is filler.Witness The rip that tears the past. The speech in front of the mirror. The yoga scene. Turkey time. Gobble Gobble. The Baywatch. The Tabasco sauce. The morgue. The plastic knife. The sweet heterolingus. Christopher Walken showing more fire in 3 minutes than he has in YEARS talking about ice cream and Marie Callendar's pies. Pacino's scene. Yes he's YELLING again. He's playing a mobster again. So what? Now name another recent movie with that many rewindworthy scenes. I can't either.Jennifer Lopez is sexy in this movie. Anyone who says she's not is lying. Ben Affleck is not. Nor is he supposed to be. People who say he's trying to be sexy and dangerous missed the point somewhere. He's doing a riff on Andrew Dice Clay plain and simple. He knows he's acting like a buffoon. Anyone who likes him on SNL should like him here.Everyone should see this movie at least once. You'll have a good time. Even if you're watching it to see how bad it is you won't be disappointed. No I wouldn't want to sit through the whole movie again. It's too long and i honestly can't remember what the hell happened at the end. But movies like this are why DVD was invented.".

That's basically like Gigli a movie that's not particularly good as a whole but has some knockout individual scenes.First off let's be honest...it's not as bad as we've been led to believe. Look at the message board  more and more people are admitting it's not that bad. Not exactly praise but considering SO many people voted this into the Bottom 100 it's at 29 when I wrote this I think it's safe to say most of those were just padded votes mainly from people who wanted to hate this movie and hated the whole Bennifer thing. Ebert gave it mild thumbs down and said he was deluged with hate mail complaining how he didn't hate it ENOUGH. Gimme a break.OK the plot is awful. No bones about that. In case you don't know here it is A mafia hitman kidnap's a DA's retarded brother so the case won't go to trial. He's a notorious screwup so the mob sends a 2nd hitman who's a lesbian and looks like a supermodel to make sure Hitman 1 doesn't screw up. They sit around an apartment talking and debating.

	schema:reviewBody "I've postponed seeing this film for quite a while for obvious reasons it's arguably the most hated film ever made perhaps even more than Battlefield Earth. But last night morbid curiosity finally got the best of me and I caught it on Encore.And amazingly astonishingly against all odds it's not that bad. It isn't great it isn't even quite good but on a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a 6. It's okay. It held my interest from start to finish and even had some intriguing elements that far less notorious failures have lacked.What surprised me most was how heartfelt and engaging it was thanks mainly to one of Ben Affleck's best performances. Turns out he's got a real flair for comedy his halfbaked Robert DeNiro impersonation is a hoot and I have no doubt is quite intentional. The movie is built around his baffledflummoxedbemusedexasperated reactions to his illtempered boss gorgeous lesbian watchdog and handicapped hostage and they're all quite believable and funny. Naturally given the amount of vitriol that was directed at the film I assumed that Affleck just phoned in his performance as he's been known to do but that's far far from the case. He carries this film the way Tom Cruise carried Rain Man. Of course Gigli is not Rain Man but it's not Affleck's fault.Gigli is remarkably a genuinely and quite intentionally funny film at times more so than the obvious and desperate Bringing Down the House for instance. Affleck halfheartedly reading the toilet paper packaging in lieu of a bedtime story to pacify his childlike hostage is hysterical. So is the latter's Baywatch obsession and his antics with Affleck's cell phone and his who's on first? routine with Affleck's boiling crime boss.Justin Bartha as the mentally handicapped hostage is no Dustin Hoffman to be sure and at times his performance makes you cringe because his level of retardation seems to fluctuate depending on the scene  but he gets laughs. Jennifer Lopez really struggles with some of her line readings particularly in her scene with Al Pacino how is this the same actress who was so impressive playing a similar character in Out of Sight? but she looks amazing and she gives off the necessary sexual spark to make the romantic comedy elements work.But if only director Martin Brest had revised his script before shooting to iron out the film's three principle flaws. One it's so weak the way Lopez' character is introduced I guess that's something many viewers just couldn't get past. She's clearly no tougher than Affleck is so why is she there again? It might have been interesting if Affleck's boss had had a secret soft side recognized his underling's loneliness and sent Lopez to try to kill two birds with one stone cure Lopez of her homosexuality and play cupid. But he has no soft side he's a twodimensional monster and it never makes a great deal of sense.Second the plot is much too thin. Christopher Walken shows up for one scene and then vanishes never to be heard from again! This film obviously NEEDS him to stick around and keep the heat on our heroes in addition to Affleck's boss. How a filmmaker as experienced as Martin Brest could have failed to recognize that is beyond me. I can only speculate that the studio wanted to max out the Bennifer angle and stuff in as many scenes featuring the two of them as possible even at the expense of our greatest living character actor not to mention the demands of the story.Third the film is 30 minutes too long and badly edited. There are a number of scenes that just stretch on two three or four beats longer than they should particularly that scene where Lopez scares off those punks with her interminable eyegouging monologue. I'd heard that the dialogue in Gigli was just atrocious but I didn't really think it was that bad just longwinded. Had the film been edited down to a compact 90 minutes I have little doubt that it would have received a more favorable response. There's just enough material here for a good movie but Brest spreads it too thin.The most interesting thing about Gigli is that it's kind of a tenderhearted crime flick. It's more interested in the feelings and the emotions of its characters than the violence they engage in or refuse to engage in. The sudden killing towards the end of the film is as jarring as anything I've seen because it comes out of nowhere and Affleck and Lopez seem authentically horrified at what they've witnessed in most crime films the leads would feign disinterest and play it cool  not here.I really bought that Bartha brought out the big brother father figure in Affleck and Lopez his sensitive caring feminine side. Clearly he's not cut out for his line of work and that's what his two companions help him to realize. That is not an insignificant thing. Would that less reviled films boasted such a satisfying character arc.So why does this film have a microscopic 2.2 rating at IMDb? Perhaps people are reviewing Affleck's and Lopez' overpublicized failed romance instead of the film  beats the heck out of me.".

It is in the basis of advertisement manipulation of public opinion and ultimately fanaticism. Gigli is another clear example of how people can be manipulated by other people's opinions. I saw the movie as I saw the 100 movies in the IMDb top list and Gigli is average. I give it 6 stars. For all you people who have rated this with one start and posted comments saying exactly what the other 99 said for the benefit of yourself your family the beloved country our species and the world as a whole and our future please start thinking for yourself.

ANyways what's up with all the negative reviews and the other horrible things that have happened because of the reaction this movie received? From beginning to end I though GIGLI was very enjoyable well acted well written with great diologue and had a good pace.Ben Affleck was having a good time with his role. Some people may say he doesn't have that tough guy persona but he showed it really well here. Weather he was being a wisecracker or getting angry he put in a great performance. Jennifer Lopez was excellent as Ricki. This is her best role. That might not sound right to many people out there but I mean it and it's saying a lot. Her delivery of her lines was great. And of course she and Ben had very very good chemestry. It is hard to beleive that they weren't in love at the time of this film. It was kind of like watching Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz in VANILLA SKY where you could see both actors falling for each other. Such a thing was a joy to watch.The movie had the feeling of GET SHORTY or OUT OF SIGHT with it's quirkyness. Even something of a HUDSON HAWK feel. Another horribly blasted movie which was really a great film. Maybe these two have something in common. Christopher Walken and Al Pacino come in to deliver their own monologues. I always love watching Chris act. He is so funny. Al was his usual self and I never get tired of his acting.I don't know what it is that people hate about this movie. Maybe it's because too many people are offended by how much Ben and Jenn are given so much attention because of their real life relationship. I really don't know what that has to do with hating a movie. Maybe it's because people expected something big?Like what?It's really sad that few people will be able to see into this film as being entertaining. Martin Brest hasn't directed a movie in 5 years. MEET JOE BLACK A very underrated film I get the feeling that he won't be able to direct another movie for a long time. He is a very good director. The  producer Joe Roth is saying the movie's failure is his fault too so that's a sign that Martin will be blacklisted because of this. What kind of injustice is that? Ben and Jenn will probably have to apologize about this movie too. It's a good thing they already have other movies coming out or else their careers could be seriously hurt.ATTENTION ALL OPEN MINDED PEOPLE This isn't the best movie of the yearbut there really is a good movie in here.8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie really suffered from the over exposure of Beniffer. Never in the history of motion pictures has a film been dead in the water before it ever made it to the big screen. Critiques were waiting to trash this film. Had it turned out to be the second coming of Gone With the Wind they still would have trashed it. Fans feeding off the negativity trounced it as well. It never had a chance. Now that some time has passed and it can be looked at without the animosity and preconceived hatred of Ben and Jen I think Gigli stands up pretty well. Let me say at the time I was not particularly a fan of Ben Affleck nor was I then or currently a fan of JLo's singing or acting. I just thought the movie had a nice story some funny dialog and actually deserved better than it got from fans. For those who do not know Affleck is Gigli a wannabe mob stooge who is given the task of kidnapping Brian the retarded brother of a government witness. Enter Ricki a lesbian assassin who is hired to ride herd on Gigli so he does not screw up. Gigli starts to fall for Ricki and she despite her orientation feels something special for him as well. The byplay between Affleck and Lopez is funny and its obvious they have chemistry even if they eventually broke up. JLo's yoga routine alone is reason to own this movie. If there is a better explanation and visual of the difference between the male and female genitalia than the one JLo espouses while stretching in spandex I have not seen or heard it. Justin Bartha later to gain fame as Riley in the National Treasure movies gives a pretty impressive performance as the mentallychallenged Brian. My biggest issue with this movie is the inclusion of Al Pacino as a gangster talk about stretching yourself as an actor At some point in his career someone told Pacino that acting entails slowly raising his voice until he is railing at the top of his lungs. That's all he does in his movies. He just escalates his tone. That's not acting. That's a recipe for an ulcer. This movie is not going to change your life but its also not going to end it. See it without the baggage of petty critics and People Magazineinfluenced movie goers.".

Abandon all hope ye who enter here. 'Ha' you sneer defiantly hitting play on Netflix. Somewhere in the distance you hear a faint skittering as all nearby mice birds and insects flee in terror. 'This isn't so bad! I've already made it through the whole first scene of Ben Affleck's fourthwall breaking excruciating Joiysey posturing and Big Hair with my wits intact. Gigli schmeely! Oh ho. Just you wait friend. This is the mere foreplay before the true agony begins. Now we venture into the land of Inquisitives. What are they saying? I can't decipher the bogusJersey! What is happening? Who is that man hunched over those sunflower seeds? Is that Justin Bartha that lovable scamp from National Treasure and The Hangover? What's he doing? Is he......is that...supposed to be like Rain Man? Why is he rapping? Oh. Oh no. Oh no no.Yes. But if this jawdroppingly offensive depiction of an intellectual disability facetoBig Hair with Affleck's mawkish gangster isn't already enough to make your eyes start to bleed don't worry you've yet to meet Jenny From The Block. She arrives croptopped with a chorus of funk guitar fanfare here to engage in glorious battle with Affleck and his Hair. A battle of the sexes you say? Nay  they battle to see who can be the most embarrassing actor. And the battle is fierce. You think you've stomached flat tone deaf emotionally gyroscopic overacting before? Not like this. NOT. LIKE. THIS! As they open their mouths words tumble out. Words arranged so impenetrably ornately so indefatigably nonsensical so riotously wretched that they extend beyond the screen like creeping Poltergeist claws and vigorously disembowel any viewer despicable enough to be within reach. Over time the words feed off the despair of their listeners accruing more malevolent mass and becoming monologues. Monologues anointing Affleck his true title of the 'Sultan of Slick' christening Lopez Queen 'DykeosaurusRexy' and in a feat of Tarantinotheft that would defy belief if everything else in this movie hadn't already defied belief out of the dictionary explaining the process of 'Digital Orb Extrusion' in Tai Moi Chai. At this point logical thought is a distant whiff of a memory scattered like grains of sand in the ocean of Affleck's Hair Product. You'd want to let out a silent scream. But Affleck and Lopez have stolen all the words. And all you can do is babble. But lo! A bright star emerges! Here we are visited by a kindly extraterrestrial from the Planet Walken. Concealing his fear behind his bugeyed Cheshire cat grin he attempts to approximate conventional human parlance to warn you of the dangers that ensue from prolonged exposure. But your brain has already eroded too much to decipher the coded messages hidden in his talk of ice cream and pie. Desperate he croaks out a final warning of Gigli's most devastating side effect Your tongue will slap your BRAINS out trying to get TO it! But it is too late. The final Brain Slap has begun. You fester in your own sick in this purgatory of Gigli's apartment slobbering and gibbering like a lobotomized bulldog as the strains of inappropriately saccharine romantic synth music form a dubstep remix with the word Baywatch and jackhammer a gong in your cavernous skull. Here the movie sinks in for the kill. You hear Bartha utter the phrase penis sneeze but you are numb. You see every other woman in the film reduced to a boorishly flirtatious or hysterical whimsically suicidal lesbian caricature but you are numb. Hell you even sit through the final hallucinogenic indignity of Al Pacino?! clad in a Talking Heads oversized suit actually trying ??!?! to infuse some class or energy into the film. But you are numb. Numb because you have sat through two of the most stupefying monologues in cinema history. Behold Ben Affleck's fistpumping ode to the penis and Jennifer Lopez's yogic aria to the vagina. With their powers combined the film finally filibusters any remaining brain cells out of your head. 'He turns her straight 1964 James Bond style?!' you would normally incredulously gripe. Normally. But by the time you reach the sanctuary of Baywatch it's too late. Your motor functions have run their course you are more vegetable than human now. The Brain Slap is complete. If only you'd listened to Walken emissary from a faraway galaxy. He would have warned you about Gigli  namely that the effects of consumption approximate in the words of the beloved Douglas Adams having your brains smashed in by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick. But there is no gold here. Only pain. Only suffering. Now  if you had a chance of preventing this fate dear viewer. If you could turn back time and avoid drinking in this unfathomable chasm of universal offensiveness this abominable void of oblivion. If you could save not only yourself but the world as you know it. If you could take the hype not as a comedic drunken challenge but as a dire chilling warning. Would you be in the words of Walken InTERested? 110".

Neither film was successful at the box office and pundits predicted they would soon be forgotten...but a new force in the movie industry was emerging video rentals and SILVERADO with it's spectacular action sequences charismatic heroes and sweeping unforgettable music score by Bruce Broughton was an unexpected and overwhelming hit drawing Hollywood's attention to the new market and lifting the film to the nearclassic cult status it enjoys today.While PALE RIDER would focus on Clint Eastwood's continuing demythologizing of the West which would culminate in 1992's UNFORGIVEN SILVERADO embraces all the 'classic' Western clichs serving them up with such exuberance that they seem 'fresh'. The story of four likable 'shootists' of nearly superhuman skills bonding and ultimately taking on a corrupt sheriff and his brutal gang of deputies in the town of Silverado trots out one traditional element after another from the classic 'bushwhack' with a John Ford 'Doorway Framing' homage shot to the 'pretty widow' in a wagon train from the 'saloonkeeper with a heart of gold' to the 'crooked gambler with a concealed weapon'...and even climaxes with that most traditional of finales as two expartners face off on a dusty street in an oldfashioned Western shootout.The four leads couldn't have been cast more perfectly Scott Glenn channels Gary Cooper as a laconic cowboy fresh from an undeserved 5year prison stretch Kevin Kline exudes his signature charm as an exgang member whose life changed because of a dog Danny Glover is warm and reassuring as a man moving west from Chicago to help his family armed with a legendary Henry rifle and best of all young Kevin Costner in his breakout performance is irresistible wild and acrobatic as Glenn's everoptimistic carefree younger brother a part Kasdan wrote specifically for the actor after his scenes were cut from THE BIG CHILL.The supporting cast is equally superb with standout performances by giant Brian Dennehy John Cleese as a sheriff who knows 'where' his jurisdiction ends Jeff Goldblum Linda Hunt James Gammon You led a posse to my best hideout?? Jeff Fahey and in a wonderful if brief role breathtaking Rosanna Arquette as the widow courted by both Kline and Glenn.

Director Lawrence Kasdan gets the most out of everything the wide open spaces the sleepy little western towns and Bruce Broughton's rousing westernflavored score. It sometimes seems like the movie tried to pack too much in but it's handled quite well by someone who obviously knows how to make an entertaining western. The climax is great with at least three different showdowns going on at once. It's a shame the rumored and actually scripted five years later sequel was never made and it probably never will be because I wouldn't mind seeing what these characters are up to years after this funfilled adventure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Silverado is damn good fun. Being a small fan of the Western genre I felt this was the most refreshing one I've seen in a while. The genre had pretty much died but came back in Silverado and it felt so fresh.The plot is simple and cliche I think it's paying homage to the classics. It sticks within the Western boundary and does its thing.The cast is pretty good and well known but in 1985 these actors were just Hollywood virgins. I was surprised by John Cleese he stuck out like a sore thumb but I enjoyed his performance. You have Costner hamming it up and Jeff Goldblum was cool. Scott Glenn was probably the best. Hell Glover was pretty good too.The direction is wonderful as is the editing the film moves along at a decent pace. I wish Lawrence was a more prominent director he deserves more success.The film score is very nice fits the film perfectly.Overall one of the best Westerns in the last 25 years.".

I love the humor woven through the episodes of action and buddyhood and nearly fell out of my seat laughing when John Cleese first appeared on screen. His first line is an alltime great right up there with Tommy Lee Jones' My my what a mess in The Fugitive I won't quote it in case you haven't seen the film. If you want to be thoroughly entertained for a couple of hours and don't require powerful social import in your viewing choices I'd recommend Silverado strongly. Actually the relationship of Danny Glover to the main protagonists IS socially important so enjoy that too.".

It's a highspirited adventure that is fun does not take itself too seriously well maybe a little and cheerfully reenacts Western clichs. It's the kind of movie where you can tell the actors had fun making it and you have fun too.The acting is uniformly excellent. Kevin Kline Scott Glenn and Danny Glover all bring quiet dignity as well as lowkey humor to their roles but it's Kevin Costner who impressed me the most. As Glenn's cocky young brother Costner doesn't even bother to contain his glee at being in a Western. He gives the most fun performance in the movie and it's good to see a younger Costner not taking himself nearly as seriously as he does now. The supporting cast has some nice players John Cleese shows up as a fairminded sheriff who seems to have walked over from a Monty Python skit Academy Awardwinner Linda Hunt 'The Year Of Living Dangerously' steals scenes as a strongwilled bar owner who Kevin Kline befriends and Brian Dennehy is thoroughly slimy as the villain.The action is fun and director Lawrence Kasdan shows a gift for this material granted he was the person who wrote 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and the screenplay also by Kasdan is joyous in the way it resurrects the Western. The movie also has one of the best action scores I've ever heard by Bruce Broughton and I was humming the title theme as the movie concluded.'Silverado' is a shining example of the Western genre and it stands as one of the greatest pure entertainment Westerns ever made.".

Among the lists you see on this website's message boards and elsewhere you rarely see this movie mentioned among top westerns and that is a huge oversight.There are four main good guys that are played by wellknown actors Kevin Kline Scott Glenn Kevin Costner and Danny Glover. I especially liked Kline as Paden with his gentlemanly manner about him and Glenn's voice always makes him interesting. Costner is so young looking he almost looks like a teenager.Brian Dennehy as the villainous Sheriff Cobb is verbally restrained in here which was nice to hear for a change but he's still intense and fascinating. This movie marked the 10000th time Hollywood made a lawman the villain since the 1960s.The story is fun a straight cowboy movie with no romances or gratuitous sex scenes thrown in and has the usual beautiful western scenery and photography. The only problem was the sound. The soundtrack is so loud so have to crank up your center speaker to hear the dialog over the music.".

As far as I am concerned he can do no wrong. He is one of the very best actors in the business during the last 20 or 30 years just an absolutely fabulous talent.Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised but even Jeff Goldblum was great in this role. Oh I know he's good but I would have thought and did think that a Western setting would find him out of place. Wrong.Sheb Wooley has a small part and it was great to see him in what turned out to be one of his last roles. He of course was right at home.Kevin Kline Scott Glenn and Danny Glover also looked right at home as if they had been born making Westerns.Linda Hunt another actor who can seemingly do no wrong was in another movie this same year 1985 the terribly unfairly ignored Eleni and it and Silverado both were much better than the movie that carried nearly all the awards and which I won't name here.That other film might have deserved the Oscar for its score but even the score of Silverado was first class and would have got my vote if I were allowed to cast a ballot. Bruce Broughton who has scored mostly for television looked to be on the way to picking up the mantle of Elmer Bernstein and I even bought the recorded score  at retail rates! Which I never do. It is excellent music.Silverado is an almost perfect movie.Oh and the second reason there shoulda been a sequel The last words shouted by the Kevin Costner character. Watch this movie and listen.".

It deals with a misfit bunch of friends come together to right the injustices which exist in a small town .

He is always SO good at the nutty cruel crazy type of character. Must be the contrast of his blue eyes with his dark hair. Did a great job. And even if you don't like Kevin Costner as some don't he did a fantastic job as the cocky young afraid of nothing brother of Emmet. And he looked like he had a blast playing the part. And he sure could ride. I remember that Scott Glen had a harder time adjusting to being a cowboy during the training for the film.. and got hurt I think. He sure overcame that..looked like a natural too. Yes they should have made a sequel the group of actors were too good together to not see again. Other favorite westerns? Tombstone.....Val Kilmer as Doc was SUPERB. Probably the best character in a western EVER. boy that was a good one!!!!Favorite old western? The Cowboys with John Wayne.Enjoy Siverado!!!!".

	schema:headline " I have nothing but compliments for this gun and trailblazing Western opus a symbol of the genre's unwillingness to die";
	schema:reviewBody "After the financial disaster of Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate in 1980 the Western movie genre had appeared to slip away into an unexpected demise after so many decades of enormous popularity. Then in 1985 two filmmakers who owed their inspiration and in one case their career to the old Westerns brought it back from the cinematic grave of the cutting room. The first one was a revolutionary Western by Clint Eastwood. Pale Rider 1985 brought back the dark cynical life of the gloomy but powerfully allegoric Westerns like Shane 1953. And then there was Silverado which instilled new life into our perception of the old classic gun and trailblazing Westerns like The Magnificent Seven 1960. As an avid fan of the Westerns both old and new I have nothing but compliments for Silverado and even now almost a quarter of a century since its theatrical debut it still holds up as a terrifically entertaining goodhearted Western action film and fills the souls of its viewers with the same wild love and thrill that the classics and the men who made them have.While Pale Rider and later Unforgiven 1992 brought us a gritty cynical view of the 19th century world Silverado brings us one full of glory and spectacle from its magnificent scenery to its pulseraising downtown shootouts and standoffs. Back with a new look but the same charm are the tough laconic heroes riding on elegant steeds and hauling flashy bulletspitting hardware on their legs. Back are the sneering equally laconic villains who spit before they draw their guns. Back are the classic shootouts where the good guys score a direct hit with every shotno matter the distance or the situationand the bad guys miss with every shot and yet somehow this improbable and certainly unrealistic formula still works. Silverado is basically the same kind of film as The Magnificent Seven 1960 and the other gunblazing Westerns from the golden age revamped and upgraded for a more contemporary audience but still working more or less in the same way.Silverado is full of oldfashioned but terrifically entertaining action scenes ranging from fistfights to classic oneonone showdowns in the middle of a deserted dusty street but part of what also keep it standing on its own feet are the background stories of the colorful characters many of whom are played by actors quite unfamiliar to the Western genre. Again some of the subplots are oldfashioned and familiar such as the commonly used bout between homesteaders and range men but because its freshened up and ramped up it works. Director producer and writer Lawrence Kasdan is to be congratulated enormously on this thundering exciting Western opus. Full of witty dialogue beautiful backgrounds colorful things in the foreground a wonderful Academy Awardnominated music score by Bruce Broughton and again that same oldfashioned but never dying charm of the old 50s and 60s Westerns Silverado is the kind of film that the whole family can sit down and enjoy. The Western genre may have slowed down and may be a little more obscure today than it was forty years ago but it will never die completely. A flower may wilt but its elegance is forever remembered. Silverado is just like its tagline claims the ride of your life.".

Not to mention the locations which I could have sworn I recognized from films like The Big Country and anything by John Ford.For example Brian Dennehy did a fine job but you could tell who his character was just by the fact that Dennehy was cast in the role.  Many of his characters share the traits of Sheriff Cobb more than this I won't say here.I have to say that as a firm nonfan of Kevin Costner even I have to admit he did fine here as well... as did all the lead actors.  Their careers since Silverado have demonstrated that this was an unusually gifted ensemble.".

	schema:headline " An Homage that works on it's own";
	schema:reviewBody "Many other people here have commented on how formulaic this movie is. Sure it is it's Kasdan's tribute to the Westerns he loves. One doesn't write a tribute to the Beatles without some kind of imitation. Take it for what it is on that level.But it's also a great movie on it's own. The acting is terrific the plot is pretty much what the plot of a Western is supposed to be and we all agree on the scenery and music.I have trouble with some of the other negative reviews. Several state that the characters are too black and white. I didn't see it. Look at the 4 main characters. Emmet is just out of prison for murder. Justified? Sure but still murder. Paden is a reformed crook seemingly trying to go straight. Mal is a black sheep whose family thinks he abandoned them. And Jakewell he's immature and thinks with his guns. All three of them. How are they too good and pure? The movie is about writing wrongs and redeeming oneself so there have to be some skeletons buried.The actors portraying the main 4 do a great job. Scott Glenn makes Emmet a man of iron will. Kevin Kline's Paden is a fatalist just trying to keep alive. Danny Glover plays Mal as a man that wants to be treated as a man with dignity and the desire for what's right. And Kevin Costner is just having a rollicking good time.The bad guys are somewhat formulaic I agree though I think Brian Dennehy as Cobb comes across as a crook who is trying to sorta go straight. Sure he'll do what he has to but he's found a place where he thinks he can fit in and he'll do what has to be done to keep it. Jeff Fahey as Tyree is terrific there's not enough of him. He's a complete psychopath but Fahey does a great job he's got the whole Helter Skelter eyes thing going on.Other roles are less interesting. I agree that Jeff Goldblum's Slick is not much nor wellplayed. I think the idea of the crooked gambler was good but the part didn't work out well. Too bad. John Cleese worked as a sheriff. Sure he added a light touch and I think the role was written specifically for him just a hunch but he's also a realist. He wants to keep the peace in his town and that's it. If the Bad Guys get away well good riddance. Just don't come back.I did like Rosanna Arquette. She played a hardworking woman with some funny ideas. Understated and true. It's impossible to make her look anything less than breathtaking but they dressed her in a matronly fashion and avoided the temptation to have her bathe in a convenient body of water which broke my heart then and now.As for the story well so what if the climax was predictable. This is a movie it's not a documentary. The good guys win and the bad guys die for their sins. Duh. Was it surprising that Cobb and Paden faced off in the street? No but that's what one expects in a Western. And it was done well. Both men knew it was coming and both faced Fate knowing that their friendship if that's the right word means nothing. Lots of bad guys got killed but that's what happens when you back the wrong horse. They made their choices and it ended badly.I think that the biggest problem here is the lack of background. As mentioned above the characters have histories that bring them all together here but we don't know any more. Why did Mal leave his family? What is the background of Paden and so on. Given the length of the movie none of this could be covered which is why a prequel would be a great idea. Perhaps LK could do one now with different actors portraying the younger men and women....? So overall it's a great movie and a great western. It pays tribute to the great ones that went before even requiring the same suspension of disbelief as some of them. But it's a good vs. evil story and succeeds well. Was it as real as Eastwood's Unforgiven which I found boring? Probably not but Clint was going for the Antiwestern. Kasdan went for the real thing. What he achieved is a classic movie of it's genre. Watch it know it love it.".

It may not be innovative but that may well have been the point as Kasdan aims to pay tribute to a beloved movie genre that dated all the way back to the silent era. Admittedly this one came along when the Western was going through a bit of a dry spell which made it all the more welcome.Four very engaging stars  Kevin Kline as Paden Scott Glenn as Emmett Danny Glover as Mal Kevin Costner as Jake  are an interesting combo as these characters united by circumstance eventually band together to fight against the injustices occurring in the town of Silverado. More than once they prove their worth in a story written by Kasdan and his brother Mark that is fairly episodic.Silverado is extremely well shot by John Bailey in widescreen. It gets the look of a classic Western just right. It hooks you right away with an opening moment of quiet suddenly interrupted by a gunfight and promises a substantial amount of entertainment to come when we're introduced to the tough and resilient Emmett and get a load of the majestic New Mexico locations. Admittedly this doesn't work quite as well when you start to think about it too much so it's better to just go with the flow and appreciate all that Kasdan and his cast  crew have packed into this presentation. Certainly it would be hard not to get roused by that stirring and wonderful music score composed by Bruce Broughton.There's a lot of acting talent to go around here but giving things a curious quality is some unexpected casting. Linda Hunt? Jeff Goldblum? JOHN CLEESE? Rosanna Arquette is fairly appealing if somewhat aloof as the gal who catches both Klines' and Glenns' eyes. Jeff Fahey makes his film debut as scruffy psycho Tyree. Lovely ladies Amanda Wyss and Lynn Whitfield play local girl Phoebe and Mals' sister respectively. Recognizable character players in the cast include Marvin J. McIntyre Sheb Wooley James Gammon Ray Baker Joe Seneca Earl Hindman Jim Haynie Richard Jenkins also making his film debut Pepe Serna Ted White and an uncredited Brion James as Hobart the wagon master. The real standout for this viewer is Brian Dennehy who never overplays his role as villainous sheriff Cobb instead suffusing the character with a good deal of charm.The pacing rarely slows down and the action scenes are first rate. Especially good is a scene involving a stampede.While lacking the overall impact for this viewer to consider it great it's still pretty fun while it lasts.Seven out of 10.".

John Cleese actually had a serious role as a mayor of a small town. There were some good lines. I liked when Danny Glover's character said you really don't know much about 'being human'? That's true. You can spend your whole life not knowing about people and how to deal with people. Kevin Kline was great as a very cool intelligent gunfighter. He wanted to keep his friendship with his old friend played by Brian Dennehy. It took him a little time to look into things and find out that his buddy had become a really bad guy. QUESTION Why did the gambler Jeff Goldblum try to kill Danny Glover's character? He never appeared to be in with the sheriff. My guess is that the gambler was doing it for publicity. He thought he could take the guy on and live to brag about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a screenwriter I can see how this movie was made and I'm taking notes NOT to do this in my own work. With four characters none are developed enough to create strong empathy for anyone. In fact perhaps the strongest empathy created is to Mal who loses a father and witnesses the shooting of his sister  yet Mal isn't perceived as the main 'hero'. Of the other main characters Jake Costner simply tags along acting goofy yet he has one of the better performances of the bunch. Emmett has no clear motivation in the story until the last 40minutes. Paden's development is weak and he finally befriends the bartender over an hour into the movie. Knowing her for only a 24hr period and not in a romantic way he's willing to step aside and watch his friends get shot up so that she won't get fired? It's not believable. In my opinion the story doesn't work and surprisingly some of the acting looked like... acting. It didn't seem natural. At the 1hr 45min mark I was hoping the movie would end and 30minutes later I was granted satisfaction. If this film can be considered one of the better westerns it's no wonder the western has disappeared over the past twenty years.".

This kind of sham is likely what did westerns in after all. John Ford Howard Hawks Henry Hathaway and others who really knew how to make westerns must have spun in their graves with this piece of stuff came out. Kasdan manages to liftcopy many classic elements from really great westerns an overthe drivers shoulder shot from inside a covered wagon from Hawks Red River the door frame shot near the beginning from Ford's The Searchers and the line Start the ball near the end from Peckinpah's Ride the High Country just to name three. The cast most of whom are quite good never really gets to shine having to constantly gun down so many others. The number and consistency of killings is mindnumbing and even boring after two plus hours. It's like a cartoon. Apparently there were an almost endless supply of villains to be killed. And also apparently said villains couldn't shoot worth a hoot hardly ever hitting or even coming close to the heroes. If the old west was really like this no one would have survived. Everyone would have been killed. In summary Silverado is a weak story of nearly continuous episodes of killings and violence too infrequently punctuated with dialog or any meaningful exposition.".

	schema:reviewBody "By the mideighties received opinion in the movie industry was that the Western was dead and buried. Although opinions differed as to the precise cause of death it was generally agreed that the final nail in the coffin was the failure of Michael Cimino's massive Heaven's Gate.Two men dared to defy received opinion Clint Eastwood and Lawrence Kasdan.That Eastwood should stand out against the tide was perhaps unsurprising he had after all both starred in and directed some iconic Westerns during the genre's last hurrah in the late sixties and early seventies. That Kasdan should have done so is more of a surprise. In 1985 he was a rising young director who had already made two successful films the steamy neonoir thriller Body Heat and The Big Chill a psychological drama about a group of sixties radicals trying to cope with the more conservative climate of the eighties. It was therefore perhaps a surprise that he should choose a traditional Western as his third film.The film tells the story of four cowboys Emmett Paden Jake Emmett's brother and Mal who travel to the town of Silverado where they help free the town from the grip of a ruthless rancher and his corrupt sheriff. Anyone familiar with the Western genre will realise that that is not exactly an original plot it goes back at least as far as something like Dodge City from the late thirties and probably much further but in fact the storyline is more complex than that brief summary would suggest with each of the four being given a backstory. All four have good reason to want revenge against the rancher McKendrick.In the sixties and early seventies there had been a trend towards revisionist Westerns films like Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch or Altman's McCabe and Mrs Miller which reacted against traditional portrayals of the Old West and tried to deglamorise it or debunk its mythology. Like all revolutions however this one gave rise to a counterrevolution in this case films which quite defiantly celebrated the heroic Legend of the West. Most of John Wayne's later Westerns such as True Grit or The Cowboys can be seen as antirevisionist in this sense and Silverado is another example. Kasdan was setting out to celebrate not call into question traditional ideas of the West his is a West where the heroes are heroic the villains villainous and the men in the metaphorical white hats always come out on top.Most of the cast play their parts well including the two Kevins Costner and Kline as the brothers Paden and Jake Brian Dennehy as the villainous sheriff and Danny Glover as the black cowboy Mal. The presence of a black cowboy is one of the few things to set the film apart from oldtime Westerns which were normally made on the mistaken assumption that there were no AfricanAmericans living west of the Mississippi. Scott Glenn however is rather dull as Emmett and former Python John Cleese is horribly miscast as another sheriff whom he plays as an upperclass Englishman. This is not necessarily inaccurate doubtless there were English immigrants in the West but Cleese's style of acting has always been more suited to comedy than to serious drama.The main problem with the film is that Kasdan does not really succeed in bringing anything new to the Western genre in the way in which one of his stars Kevin Costner was to succeed in doing with Dances with Wolves a few years later or indeed as he himself was to do in his next Western Wyatt Earp which also starred Costner. The other wellknown Western from this period Eastwood's Pale Rider is not particularly original either in many ways it is an unacknowledged remake of Shane. It is however a handsome wellmade film with an iconic performance from Eastwood himself as the mysterious possibly supernatural Preacher.Pale Rider may recycle one or two wellworn situations but Silverado seems to be a compendium of nearly every stock clich from the previous fifty years of making Westerns the villainous rancher the equally villainous lawman the wagon train the cattle stampede the man wrongly accused of murder the man seeking revenge for the murder of his father the final climactic shootout in the main street of the town. Only the cavalry and the Indians are missing. Twelve years earlier Mel Brooks had done this sort of thing for laughs in Blazing Saddles Kasdan seems to be expecting us to take it seriously. He may have been hoping to reverse the decline of the Western but unfortunately Silverado is a film which unconsciously reveals one of the reasons for that decline namely that so many Westerns had been made that it became difficult to say anything about the West that had not already been said. Kasdan's next film The Accidental Tourist was to be much better. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "A good movie scene can become a clich but a clich can't become a good movie scene. Not unless it's Airplane and this isn't it's Silverado director Lawrence Kasdan's heartfelt but cluttered Valentine to the Western.Heading west reformed outlaws Emmett Scott Glenn and Paden Kevin Kline become a band first by springing Emmett's wild brother Jake Kevin Costner then by getting saved from a posse by Mal Danny Glover crack shot with a Henry rifle. Then it's off to the beckoning town of Silverado where Paden finds the bar of his dreams while the others are reunited with family. All is great  until trouble rides in.There's nothing' wrong with the land says Emmett's sister Kate Patricia Gaul it's just some of the people. That goes for Silverado the movie too. Kasdan was coming off a bumper crop of hits as screenwriter and director and thus had the ability to do whatever he wanted and work with whoever he wanted in 1985. He had some trouble cutting down on the scope of his ambition. Silverado is a big sprawling epic of a western with one of the most eclectic casts ever brought together. Kasdan and his cowriter brother Mark didn't know what to do with what they had and it shows.Rosanna Arquette is the most obvious casualty playing a homesteader who floats around the edges of the story. Kasdan admits much of the point of her character was lost on the cuttingroom floor. But even parts that made the final cut seem uneven and sketchy. Linda Hunt won an Oscar just before this was made but she doesn't seem to have any purpose in the story except to trade rueful japes with Kline playing a bar matron with a good heart. Jeff Goldblum drifts in as a gambler like Kline and Gaul a member of the cast of Kasdan's last hit The Big Chill. When he played a cowboy in Buckaroo Banzai it was supposed to be a joke but here it's for real only it isn't as Goldblum never finds a character who serves no point anyway. Glover just glowers lifelessly about what ain't right. Even Kline a favorite of mine feels shallow and flat here. Wearing a beard and duster don't make you a cowboy.The bad guys come off even worse. Brian Dennehy is their leader Cobb who smiles wryly in that Dennehy way and never kicks it into the next gear. He's still got that wry smile on when he faces down old friend Paden at the end. His gang lacks any sense of motivation or personality. Why are they doing this? someone asks only to be answered Because they enjoy it. That's not enough to go on here.The editing is atrocious. Action scenes lack spatial reality. Less than a minute after some bad guys appear out of nowhere to ambush Emmett Mal pops out of nowhere to ambush them. A few seconds after we see Jake riding out after some villains he's in a bar getting into a fight over a girl. Kasdan shot too much footage and without any organic flow to begin with the result is a hazy mess.So what did I like? Costner surprisingly plays a goofball to good effect and Glenn does nice work in the lead CooperWayne role. The opening scenes of him and Paden finding each other and springing Jake have a nice flow to them. John Cleese is another example of stunt casting here only it pays off as Cleese finds a nice blend of humor and menace playing a lawman who's not a bad guy just narrow and selfish.But then Silverado descends into clich bouncing from rustlers' hideout to stampede to showdown in mechanical fashion. It never bores you completely its desire to entertain is palpable throughout but it never rises above predictability.What a waste Dennehy says at the end. I couldn't agree more.".

Another advantage the film has is the great cast the director has assembled. The four leads Kline Glenn Glover and Costner make a terrific team with Kevin Costner especially standing out. He's never been this lively and likable on screen since unfortunately. There really is no weak link in the entire film but some of the others who stand out are Linda Hunt tough but gentle as saloon keeper Stella and Brian Dennehy whose character could have been just a great hulking bear of a villain but because of the magnetism he brings and the way he plays the part with a twinkle in his eye makes him far more interesting. This is something that is talked down nowadays a rollicking good time at the movies. Highly recommended.".

Spice it up with the centralized saloongambling hall with a guy named Slick gunslingers ladies of the evening and a vertically challenged version of Gunsmoke's Miss Kitty. Then you epically conclude it all with showdown gunfights including one in front of a church no less.Yes Silverado covers all the bases and zealously steals every Western clich' ever conceived. However with its abundance of clich' Silverado misses the opportunity to be daringly different. In comparison to Eastwood's 'Unforgiven' Silverado's message of good eventually triumphs over evil only if evil gets careless is sadly mundane and it begs the question why did they even bother to make this film?The answer lies somewhere in the conceptual thinking of the producers writers and director who tragically missed an opportunity to take a talented ensemble and make a poignant and meaningful film that actually had the potential to send a distinctive message.Ironically the last line in the movie We'll be back! is telling and I sincerely hope it never comes to fruition. So far so good!".

	onyx:emotionText "Silverado arrives as a typical Western with your standard good guys villains intruding and illprepared settlers all of their women a town in corruptive turmoil personal vendettas a ranch and the obligatory stampede. Spice it up with the centralized saloongambling hall with a guy named Slick gunslingers ladies of the evening and a vertically challenged version of Gunsmoke's Miss Kitty. Then you epically conclude it all with showdown gunfights including one in front of a church no less.Yes Silverado covers all the bases and zealously steals every Western clich' ever conceived. However with its abundance of clich' Silverado misses the opportunity to be daringly different. In comparison to Eastwood's 'Unforgiven' Silverado's message of good eventually triumphs over evil only if evil gets careless is sadly mundane and it begs the question why did they even bother to make this film?The answer lies somewhere in the conceptual thinking of the producers writers and director who tragically missed an opportunity to take a talented ensemble and make a poignant and meaningful film that actually had the potential to send a distinctive message.Ironically the last line in the movie We'll be back! is telling and I sincerely hope it never comes to fruition. So far so good!";

If all you want to do is take up space pleasantly that's good enoughThis is fun but the reason it is fun is because is because it is all borrowed from pictures we like the 'High Noon's and 'Seven Samuri's of our collective film memories. The question is not whether this film entertains it does but whether it entertains in a way that reduces or enhances our ability to be entertained next time. It think like most other formula projects it reduces it. That's because the mind seems to have only two modes recognition and learning.In a formula picture you see familiar icons behaving in expected ways. You are pleased because you are assured. The more assured and comfortable those images the happier you are in your conceptual cocoon. So these film experiences actually suck the life out of our imagination. They are in fact the equivalent of the oppressors that figure in so many of them.The only thing that saves these in the modern era are actors that overlay irony. Someone like Kline who looks at you as if to say 'look I'm playing this stupid onedimensional cartoon but both you and I know what it is wink wink nudge nudge.' Kasden provides this opening by allowing Kline to fall in love with a plainlooking dwarf. It is only slightly against the template she is a saloon owner with a heart of gold but enough to allow a silver sliver of self deprecation.".

The story is unique featuring a group of heroes who are less then honorable. We first me Emmitt Scott Glenn in a lonely dusty cabin in the middle of nowhere.

Along the journey they Mal Danny Glover a man headed home to help his Paw. The group of four men end up taking up a common cause and ending the reign of tyranny in Silverado.

	schema:headline " An Arizona set fairy tale about growing up";
	schema:reviewBody "For me the movie Arizona Dream gives a great account of how dangerous it can be to be caught up in your dreams and the little worlds those dreams can create and if you don't move beyond you're dead alive. The only character that seems to be able to step out of his own little world and capable of reflecting is Axel. All throughout the film nobody else changes but Axel. Leo a caring but wallowed in guilt character can not see his nephew as a real person but just a boy who'd take over his business once he dies. He's so caught up in his own version of reality that he doesn't see that Axel has grown up in the meantime and may want to figure out life for himself. Leo tries to shove down his world as a readymade future for Axel who has none of it. At the same time Axel can grow beyond this when Leo commits suicide and offers to help his uncle in his cardealer business. Axel seems to have a deep appreciation for life  a trait no one else seems to have in the movie. Elaine is completely caught up in her childhood dream for flying in order to overcome her own depression. The only thing that matters for her is her own survival. She is unaware how much she steals any independence from her stepdaughter and her selfserving nature makes her empty  a trait that Axel recognizes by the end of the film. In contrast Axel is first drawn to this quirky world of flying high as it seems real but once he discovers that flying is only a form of displacement for Elaine he sees through her and she looses her magnetic energy for him. Grace is the only other person capable of growing besides Axel in the movie. In her first appearances she seems like a twodimensional depressed character totally overshadowed by a sexy stepmother and consequently too depressed to be more than a little destructive animal. At the same time she seems to relate to others at least emotionally  her destructiveness at least seems like a form of connection to others. Towards the end of the movie she can grow beyond herself and can start showing love and appreciation  the other side of her negative emotions and thus turns into a real person. But this transformation is too much for her psyche as she doesn't know how to live a healthy life and even though Axel recognizes the real person in her she chooses to kill herself  she has no choice really. Axel  who at least makes the effort to connect with characters symbolizes the strength one needs to grow up and beyond what is around him. He's the most involved emotionally but because he's not caught up in his dream  or because his dream is abstract enough he can stay detached while being attached. He's capable of caring and he's the one who's always there for more adult people who need help  and he delivers One thing I was sure about The moment my parents died my childhood was gone forever. And it was gone forever he becomes more of a grown up than most grown ups around him. He knows how to keep a distance even when Grace abuses him and there's only one point in the movie when he almost looses it  when Grace invites him to play Russian roulette. For me the Eskimo scene wonderfully sums up why we are here and that's something I think Axel finds for himself by the end of the film. Instead of the existential questions brought by the first Eskimo scene  how do you survive by love nature can kill you and save you why do we replicate our lives in inhuman conditions  in the last Eskimo scene he just talks about fish with his uncle. The message for me at the end was that instead of asking all these questions you just get on with your life learn a trade you love and your life grows into the answers. At the same time coming to understand this you may have to go through a real emotional discovery of love dreams reincarnation death  and if at the end you survive and strong enough life might be worth living. It seems that Axel was lucky to have had the guidance he received from his parents but he had to experience them through his own skin. That's how he embarks at living in New York as his Mom suggested that New York has one of the eight magnetic pulls. But initially he chooses a job that not only allows daydreaming but also fosters it he tags fish for an organization. Later he's taken or dragged into a more real life but a life still of dreams and not his own yet  he moves first into his uncle's dreams and then into Elaine's and Grace's. First he has to discover responsibility by rejecting his uncle and he has to discover love and death through love. It's only after these experiences that he can leave other people's lives and dreams and start his own. It's a wonderful fairy tale where a young boy wades through the quotations from his parents to discover his own place and soul. Good morning Columbus. My mother's eternal words reminding me America was already discovered and that daydreaming was a long way from life's truths. For 15 years he'd smooth down the road between Mexico and Arizona and every morning he'd be out there looking for footprints in the dirt. But my father always said that work was like a hat you put on your head. And even without pants you didn't have to be ashamed of your ass.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some movies only work if we let ourselves carry away by them. They present a surrealistic imagination world that comes from the mind of their creators. They are hard to watch especially when they mix real characters that live their lives sometimes awaken or inside one big dream or their own dreams.Axel Blackmar Johnny Depp is a dreamer and an unusual example of personal choices. His parents died and he went to New York to work with fish. He could have sold cars with his uncle Leo Jerry Lewis but he's there talking with that monotonous voice about what he does. Maybe it was a simple dream where an Eskimo catches a fish with two eyes on the same side and tells his kids to go out with their dog so he and his wife canAnd the kid with the dog allow to see an orange balloon that seems to go from Alaska to New York where Alex sleeps in a truck. Wake up Columbus the words of his mother and Axel's hope to find something in the land already discovered by that man.Alongside fish flying through the air we join Axel to be the best man of his uncle's wedding. With his friend Paul Leger Vincent Gallo the untiring chats go from movies to philosophies about cakes pies and bananas. Paul is an actor I'm having a great performance on Friday he says. It's an audition Axel says to humiliate him. The truth is that it's not even an audition. This stuff lived by Axel is a story for us but is a personal rediscovering and rethought of decisions in life for the character. When he sees Elaine Faye Dunaway he feels something strong but doesn't know how to call it. Days later he becomes the lover of a woman decades older than him. Elaine's daughter Grace Lili Taylor is also there and it doesn't goes long until Axel finds himself in a crossroad between the heart of two women that as he describes them are too similar and big to be in the same world.David Atkin's story and screenplay comes plagued of phrases that could come out of a lunatic's mouth but they fit in the film's context and twist your head at maximum. I've got to climbIt's a long way to the moon I'm gonna live forever until I become a turtleThey have infinite lives besides scenes of well known movies in crucial moments. And what music Goran Bregovic! And what editing Andrija Zafranovic! And what cinematography Vilko Filac! And what director! Known for his originality recognized director Emir Kusturica puts his own signature to his movie collaborating in the story he must have dreamed a little to giving life to the dream with his flying camera full of unexpected turns and in love of its surroundings. What he achieves is greater words although not everybody could understand it and for that matter appreciate it.And his actorsJerry Lewis in a total comprehension of his character and so involved in his work that you wouldn't believe it. So incredibly likable in one of those roles we never give much importance to. Faye DunawayWow! She got to work with some of these actors later but here as an old woman in character and with respect in person she maintains that virtue of creating uniqueness with her laughs smiles and way of saying things. Lili Taylor was the most interesting character here. The silent daughter that could be crazy but no one can really tell. With imagination and freedom Taylor makes her character believable and not as overacted as it might be. Vincent Gallo who I respect mostly as a director and as an actor that does what he wants the ability he has had to choose his roles is visible here again as he shines without lights to help him. A wonderful performance his fans shouldn't miss.But DeppHow can I explain? I've said it a lot surely but I will repeat it. He's like a magician but not with the cards and the hat and the tricks. He is with his face his looks his way of talking his perfection of movementBut it's not really something technical in the acting world Johnny Depp is a magician. I'm sure he still has plenty of that for us but here is where he let us know first.In one scene Vincent Gallo's character Paul an actor requests that no one touches his face because it's important. Do you think they touch Brando's face? Do you think they touch Pacino's De Niro's? Do you think they touch Johnny Depp's face? I don't know then but not know and if they did before they shouldn't have.".

I felt I had to do something for this film confess my love in a letter send it flowers buy it Champagne. It left me gasping. I wanted more. So the rest of the night I watched the special features on the DVD.I realise that it is sad to have emotions about a film that would usually be reserved for living beings however I am completely unashamed. If this movie was a man I'd do unspeakable things to it. I don't care what it's about. I don't give a monkey's about any plot that it may or may not have. I have not searched for anything that everybody conditioned to Hollywood films however good or bad they may be inevitably searches for in a film. Why do you need to be spoonfed? Can you not just completely let go and enjoy a work of art for its mere beauty?Sorry journeying into pretentious land. This is undoubtedly my absolute favourite Johnny Depp film it used to be a toss up between Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Dead Man but I admit that this surpasses them by a fraction. I'd actually like to say that I preferred Dead Man but I um didn't. Sorry. I feel I have cheated on Dead Man. There are certain scenes in Arizona Dream that show things about Johnny Depp as a performer that I never would have suspected. In this film he stepped into a realm shared by characters in the films of Fellini and Brunuel. It pleases me that he can do art house as fantastically as this and do mainstream as well although I do not entirely approve of the stuff that is too mainstream I.E. Pirates. His character is beautifully complex he is a kook but a sexy kook and he is everything else besides. The other performances are also wonderful. Gallo is a nutcase Taylor needs therapy Dunaway is at the same time tyrannical and naive. Sure the characters contradict themselves but don't we? It just keeps it all the more desirable and fascinating.For anybody who appreciates surrealist art this is a must see. For anybody who appreciates Johnny Depp there is no question that this film is absolutely essential.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yugoslavian director Emir Kusterica is most well known for his critically acclaimed international films like Time of the Gypsies and Underground1995. He did one English language film in Ameica. The film Arizona Dream is a highly underrated film that people have seem to forgotten. Which is a shame since it has an amazing cast of well known actors like Johnny Depp Vincent Gallo Faye Dunaway Jerry Lewis and Lili Taylor. Jonny Depp plays Axel a young twenty something dreamer. In the beginning of the film he has a dream about an Eskimo family. He works at a dock cleaning fish and often drifts away from reality to dreams. Him and his friend Paul Vincent Gallo drive to Arizona to visit Axel's uncle Mr. Sweetie Jerry Lewiswho's a car salesman. I must say Depp and Lewis make a great comic duo. Axel and Paul end up staying with the wealthy Elaine Stalker and her suicidal daughter Grace Lili Taylor. Axel starts dating Mrs. Stalker but at the same time has strange feelings for her daughter. The film is very surreal and dreamlike. Mrs. Stalker obsessively dreams of flying so her and Axel build a flying machine that resembles a Right Brothers style airplane. It's hilarious when the plain repeatedly malfunctions. There's also a floating fish throughout the movie turtles an attempted pantie hose suicide and a weird sex scene where Jonny Depp crows like a rooster must be seen to be believed. Warner Bros. felt that the film was too European. So the film collected dust on their shelf and had a poor limited release. The film does have a magicrealist tragicomedy style like Emir Kusterica's other Eastern European films. Co writer David Atkins later went on to write the screenplay for Novacaine. Also producer Claudie Ossard has also helped produce other bizarre films like City of Lost Children. Arizona Dream is a quirky and strange masterpiece. Track down a VHS copy or better yet the 20 minute longer international version. It's quite a cult sensation in Europe.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a great movie. Having only seen it once and just an hour ago this may not be the kind of review this film deserves. One question that goes through my mind is that why have i not seen or heard of this movie before? It's pure genius this is exactly what needs to be in a good film. It's so deliciously quirky and passionately engaging. Makes you wonder if we're not all insane.Director Emir Kusturica and David Atkins provided a quirky funny and surprisingly sad story in which the characters were the organs and the direction the soul. The central theme in this film were Axel's dreams and how Axel saw the world interpreted through his dreams. And the film revolved around the message that Axel's dream world and the real world were not as different things that seemed insane or weird happened all the time.The absurdity of this film is unparalleled. spoilers Take the first scene at Elaine's house where Grace tries to kill herself with her pantyhose or when she lets her turtle walk over the dinner. And the flying scene during Elaine's birthday when Paul is reacting the North By Northwest scene. The absurdity is the purest form of comedy not the pathetic slapstick you see these days in the Adam Sandler flicks. Kusturica directed comedy so well and the actors did a splendid job on following his lead.Emotions and atmospheres were represented with such vigour vitality and craftmanship emotionally intense scenes took grip of the audience and didn't let them go. I was scared to breathe in case i might miss something. There was an urgency about the whole movie that made you almost uncomfortable. Well played well directed. Nice music too.I can't say what the meaning of this film is i would have to watch it a few more times. But I think I've just become a fan of Lili Taylor's. I recommend it to anyone who wants a breath of fresh air a truly funny and moving movie that you won't forget very soon unless you're into the Adam Sandler stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "Axel is happy with his life in New York having long since left what remains of his family behind him in Arizona. When his Uncle Leo is getting married Axel is forced back home by his friend Paul. He finds his Uncle marrying a much younger woman and while he wishes to leave as soon as he arrives he finds himself staying around and selling cars with his Uncle  a job he maintains he has to desire to do. It is on the lot that he meets the dysfunctional mother and stepdaughter Elaine and Grace the former of which he falls for and begins a relationship that evolves into an obsession with building a flying machine. Meanwhile in stark contrast to his current desert setting Axel's dreams continue to centre on an Inuit family and a flat fish with its face all on one side.Well over a decade ago now I used to make much more of an effort to get to my local cinema. At that time I lived near an independent arthouse style cinema that while it showed all the big releases on its two screens it did also give over time to smaller independent films. It was here that I saw Arizona Dream  a film that I then never saw or heard of for another ten or so years until for some reason I remembered it and decided to watch it again. I couldn't remember much about it apart from a few scenes nor if I had liked it or not so to all intents and purposes I was coming to it fresh. I say this but by the end of the film I had certainly remembered why I could recall specific scenes and my enjoyment of them but had no strong memory of the total film  the reason being that the film is at its best in small chunks but fails to work as a whole.The story is this wonderfully offthewall tale of love and dreams that fires out outrageous characters with abandon allowing for many memorable scenes and quotable lines. It is comic creative silly and enjoyable. But it is also a bit tiring. The scenes don't come together as I would have liked and the general air of silliness undermines how much I was able to get emotionally involved and care about where the story was going. That it is almost two and a half hours long only serves to highlight this and it really does feel indulgent and unwilling to give anything up. The fault for this certainly lies with Kusturica as writer and director. He certainly has a creative flair to him an ear for dialogue and an eye for a shot but his approach fragments the film and he doesn't manage to pull the heart of the viewer along with him. He does get good turns from his cast well all of whom trusted him and seemed to go wherever he wanted them to go. Depp is wonderful as always so willing to go with it so willing to try anything and it pays off by him being good here. Lewis was a surprise to me then and was again on this viewing he is solid in his character and he has this great presence that holds the attention. Gallo is also good although he is helped by how many of the better scenes he is the focal point in. Dunaway and Taylor both deliver their characters well and it is just a shame that their characters are the more difficult ones to like within the film  I think they did well though I just acknowledge that I struggled with them due to their characters.As with all cult films there will be those that see great beauty in this film and love it beyond all reason. I salute them and I envy them to a point and while I disagree with them this does not make them wrong and me right. However to the majority of casual viewers this film will come over as a total curio piece that provides delight and enjoyment in specific scenes but doesn't work as a total film and certainly doesn't have enough to it to justify the overlong running time.".

I know more than a couple of people who thought the movie was mediocre or even downright boring but I myself thought this film is just borderline genius.It's very uncommon for fantasy films to hit the theatres these days but fantasy like this is hard to come across at all. I find it difficult to accurately describe the movie mostly because I find no other similar examples to use as a frame of reference. Most of the scenes are absurd and completely wicked yet the film flows in a very natural manner never losing touch with firm ground. The spectator does however take off in a series of bizarre events in very visually appealing scenarios and becomes so entangled in the fantastic atmosphere that it reaches a point when no matter how silly or absurd an event it becomes perfectly acceptable. All of this of course has a generous amount of humour mixed in. But this isn't your typical comedy most of the laughs in this film work in a nonsensical satirical manner that even monty python would find silly. And it works.If you come across this one do see it. This might be a flick that doesn't fit everyone but if you enjoy it half as much as I did you'll end up watching it more than once.".

This  of course  being that of Johnny Depp and Lili Taylor I was not disappointed. The film  at first   absorbs the viewer into a translucent though engaging tale of exploration into the mind and soul. This makes the viewer belive momentarily that the film that they are watching is going to be fanciful and mystic.  Hence there at first is no bond between the characters and the Viewer. However  reality becomes less and less of a point or actuality in the film as it paces through the lives of the characters centering on Johnny Depp's charecter.  An ifinitity is subconsiously drawn with him as we watch. Faye Dunnaway  who  at first  seemed utterly miscast is brilliant her potrayal of the premenopausal cradlesnatcher is brilliant.  Jerry Lewis also makes the film great as gritty realism exists in wealth.  It feels like there is a piece of everyone in it  there is depression  love  life and death and the exploration of time. Although the film seems like a dream on celluloid it also makes the viewer understand and more importantly empathise with the charecters and at the end the sadness is alleviated by the theme of life  that life goes on  almost in circles. To anyone who has not yet been seriously touched by a film  watch this. It might change you're mind. 1010 p.s. Watch for the balloon scene at the beginning!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's weird going from something as dense and epic in scope as director Emir Kusturica's Underground to the fairy tale tragic romance of Arizona Dream. Weirder still is the cast of Johnny Depp Jerry Lewis Faye Dunaway Lili Taylor and Vincent Gallo.The word dream comes up at least a dozen times in this movie characters recounting dreams or the film seamlessly showing them on screen and appropriately it begins with a ten minute dream sequenceYou only know it's a dream sequence because you're told it is afterwards of an Eskimo in the snowy wilderness catching a strange fish with both eyes on the same side the Eskimo later becomes sick and is nursed back to health by his wife. From there we meet the dreamer Depp who tags fish in New York a job he loves because Most people think I count fish but I don't. I look at them. I look at their souls and read their dreams and then I let them into my dreams. Then aspiring actor cousin Vinccent Gallo shows up and asks Depp to come back to Arizona with him for his Uncle Jerry Lewis's wedding. Depp goes back and accepts a job selling Cadillacs his uncles dream for them until he meets an eccentric motherdaughter pair the suicidal turtle obsessed accordion playing Lili Taylor and her vivacious flighty sexually aggressive mother the latter Depp becomes immediately enamored with. Depp and Dunaway begin a very matter of fact and all consuming relationship he leaves his job and uncles house and refuses to leave. After hearing of Dunaway's dreams to fly as a young girl Depp decides and spends most of the movie attempting to build her a flying machine. Meanwhile Lili Taylor is sabotaging the machine and Vincent Gallo is busy practicing his acting chops his recreation of the crop duster scene from North By Northwest is one of the best all time comedy moments anywhere.All good performances Gallo and Taylor outshining the others though. The writing is also really good mostly voice over by Depp it definitely has a Jean Piere Jeaunut vibe all the little details and phrases My dad always said that work was like a hat you put on your head. And even if you didn't have pants  you didn't have to walk down the street ashamed of your ass as long as you had a hat...  or  what's the point of breathing if somebody already tells you the difference between an apple and a bicycle? If I bite a bicycle and ride an apple then I'll know the difference. The latter quote sums of the naivet of the main character and the flaw that makes the tragedy. Depps relationships are passionate sincere but essentially child like he doesn't know what to name how he fells about Dunaway so it must be love. While Dunaway and her daughter are more two halves of the same person stuck in an isolated country house both with half the maturity and vitality the other needs.For the most part the movie is all comic smiles and surreal shots of fish flying in the sky at random but towards the end the film takes somber tones as the dreamrelationships end.Not as dense and surreal as I had expected but it does capture accurately the magical sensation of first love especially with someone significantly older without stepping on the toes of similar films like Harold And Maud or focusing too heavily on taboo.There were a few moments of emotional disconnect where the characters actions make little if any literal sense the Russian roulette scene but do give a greater sense of the contradictory emotions which almost all of the characters deal with except Gallo whose clearly just there for fun.Arizona Dream caught me off guard the political allegory of Underground is replaced here with a very internal story of dreamy sensations fleeting passions conflicting dreams conflicting loves growing up and magical fish. It's not great but I definitely connected for personal reasons. If you liked Amelie or Emir Kusturica or any of the actors mentioned it's worth checking out.".

I also want to know what exactly the dreams Axel has mean. For example when the fish he sees goes and bangs staff around like the cars or that thing he builds for her to fly. what does it symbolize if it symbolizes anything.i'm supposed to write a minimum of 10 lines so i will just write staff for a while.

The script has serious problems it moves too slowly and ultimately goes nowhere. We have the troubled guy and the troubled girl. Both have issues. They have to depend on each other to survive while overcoming their ghosts. All this is established early on but dragged through ineffective flashbacks and poor dialogue for far too long. The infected are too few and far between and never seem like a real menace. Two people with a crappy rifle and some barbed wire manage to fend them off easily. The doors and windows aren't even reinforced. Most of the time they could as easily be there on a very very boring vacation rather than in the middle of a world apocalypse. The characters are not interesting. The guy is dull and clueless. The girl is always annoyed AND annoying. The other girl is just as dull as the guy and doesn't bring anything new. Their past stories should give us new insights about them but don't. The possible immunity subplot is never properly explored or settled. Its just thrown in for the sake of it like too many things in the movie. Overall The Dead Outside does have some upsides for a postapocalyptic movie  a sense of isolation and lack of hope a few very few mild scares and the cinematography isn't great but its watchable.

However as a huge fan of zombie films I think this one is criminally underrated and for those with an appreciation for something more challenging The Dead Outside delivers.The premise is dirt simple Danielle a man who recently lost his wife and child in this national zombie epidemic finds an empty house on his travels. He stops in for a bit and is discovered by a teenage girl named April who has survived their on her own for many years.The film mostly follows them in their time living together. It's a typical dynamic on paper with Danielle being more humane and not wanting to kill the zombies while April has no hesitation in killing them. While Danielle is fairly calm and collected April is volatile and paranoid. Their dialogue and interaction are realistic and nuanced. Nothing feels clich or forced here and even the revelation of April's back story which could've easily been over the top is well done.The pacing is slow and methodical. Many smaller moments such as Danielle taking a shower when the lights go out or April chopping wood adds to the feeling that we're watching life unfold rather than a traditional movie. It's helped by the camera work almost always close in adding to the intimacy and intensity. Combined with the beautiful but foggy and desolate setting creates a gripping atmosphere.The film builds into one of the most intense climaxes in a zombie film since Let Sleeping Corpses Lie and when it was over I wished that the film would go on longer. Not for any kind of loose ends left but simply to see it continue.Highly recommended especially if you're looking for something a bit different.".

As an example in one scene one of the main characters is kidnapped while one sleeps. It literally cuts from that to the sleeping character going out looking for her. It doesn't show him waking up or hearing something that wakes him up or him realizing what had happened and freaking out.There were a lot of similar gaps that unfortunately made the movie hard to understand in some parts. I'm assuming the director wants the audience to simply infer certain things about the plot and tried to use flashbacks to parlay important pieces of information regarding the back story but it was done too choppily and poorly for that to work.However overall it is still a decent movie. I love horror flms but the zombie genre has pretty much died out for me and I appreciated that this was a pandemic style movie that really took it in its own direction.It's probably really worth a 610 but I felt bad looking at some of the other poor reviews so I gave it a 7".

After watching The Dead Outside I can only picture Kerry Anne Mullaney and Kris R. Bird sitting in an empty room and having the following conversation...Let's make a movie like 28 Days Later except we'll pick up the story long after all the exciting stuff has happened and just have the characters stand around and mumble to each other.You're a genius! But let's also not explain any of the particular details of the story fill it with fragmentary flashbacks to further muddle things up and then have a character lie on a sofa and describe the plot of what would essentially be a prequel to the film we're actually going to make.I like where you're going but let's also have the storytelling and filmmaking get worse as the movie goes along. The dialog should become more insipid the performances should go from minimalistic to practically comainducing pieces of the plot should start to fall off like the film has leprosy and the editing must turn completely into crap.The more you talk the more excited I get about this project! I also think there needs to be an important scene where the soundtrack is so loud that no can understand what the actors are saying.I couldn't agree more. It's like the two of us have only one brain!After a neurological outbreak in Scotland which turned people into murderous retarded hoboes Daniel Alton Milne runs out of gas on the road and must take shelter in a seemingly deserted farmhouse which turns out to be the home of April Sandra Louise Douglas. They sort of hang out and have dueling flashbacks to much more interesting periods in their lives until another person shows up. Kate Sharon Osdin seems about to drive a wedge between the deeply f'd up April and the whiny Daniel then the Almighty Plot Hammer pounds Kate into the ground like a circus tent pole and the whole thing sputters to an ending that will leave you staring at the screen and wondering Wait. Where did that come from?This cinematic stinkburger is spoiled at the most basic of levels. Let me give you an example. A big plot point of The Dead Outside is that April is supposedly immune to whatever is turning folks into violent and unhygenic vagrants. However the script never bothers to explain what is infecting people or how they get infected. The big revelation of April's immunity is in a scene where she's been handling the bodies of some infected dead and gotten their blood on her. But at no point is it established that the virus or whatever is transmitted through the blood. So when April turns to face the camera with blood on her this film is going Ah ha! while the audience is going Uhwhat?After suffering through this thing I decided to indulge my masochism and flipped over to the DVD extras to watch the trailer. I was expecting to see one of those trailers where you can tell the movie is going to suck but this one kicked 37 different varieties of ass. It makes The Dead Outside look complex dynamic and unnerving which is about as big a miracle as Jesus doing that whole bread and fish thing. The person who made this trailer should have made the film instead. If Mullaney and Bird actually made it they should be paid extremely well to create trailers for other movies but never allowed to make another motion picture themselves.The zombie apocalypse genre doesn't exactly have the highest standards but this dishwater dull production can't even make it over that very low bar. Don't bother with The Dead Outside.".

This is fine because the repetitive score is more often than not drowning out the actors thick accents.

Other than that the story is told mostly through randomly placed flashbacks or when the characters directly explain their pasts to one another in one on one chats. The cinematography is clunky jarring and while the location is beautiful in a 'barrenfarmhills' sort of way it becomes tiring recycled and bleak.

	schema:reviewBody "Completely derivative and not very rewarding. Although the talent of the filmmakers involved is evident they sabotage themselves by working with completely empty content. Badly written badly acted and repetitive the film failed to justify its running time. THE DEAD OUTSIDE works for about 15 minutes after which its lack of momentum makes it hard to sit through. I suspect it would probably have made a good short film however.It has been mentioned that the film expects a lot from its audience but this isn't quite true. There was far too much exposition in some scenes. The characters and their stories are simply not very interesting. It's a common thing to see in an indie but the extent to which bad acting can weigh down even a good script cannot be overstated.

	onyx:emotionText "Completely derivative and not very rewarding. Although the talent of the filmmakers involved is evident they sabotage themselves by working with completely empty content. Badly written badly acted and repetitive the film failed to justify its running time. THE DEAD OUTSIDE works for about 15 minutes after which its lack of momentum makes it hard to sit through. I suspect it would probably have made a good short film however.It has been mentioned that the film expects a lot from its audience but this isn't quite true. There was far too much exposition in some scenes. The characters and their stories are simply not very interesting. It's a common thing to see in an indie but the extent to which bad acting can weigh down even a good script cannot be overstated.

The main female overacts WAY too much and to make it worse she acts like a 13 year old sulking because she can't have the new Miley Cyrus DVD. Put yourself in the characters situation  knowing that you are possibly the only cure for the disease the only hope for mankind's survival...yet you choose to be alone and isolated in a farm house somewhere. Eventually the bulletsgenerator will run out and you are done! There's one scene where she's recalling what her grandparents did and it was painful to watch. Almost as if the character was supposed to have some mental deficiency or actually supposed to be around 13 years old? The other female was a slightly better actress but it just felt like she was in the wrong movie here. Actually none of the cast really gelled together which was what made it so uninteresting to watch.The way it was shot I quite frankly got sick of the 'artsy' shots being filmed at a slight angle. The director filled the alarming lack of dialogue with constant shots of chickens planks of wood trees fences whilst slowly zooming in to the background or the dog barking  which was a pointless 'part' of the film as they even forget to take him at the end. Take out those parts and the film would have struggled to reach 50 minutes.The story We get flashbacks of the males history yet it's ultimately totally irreverent as it leads to nothing. We get told toward the start that the drug he's taking only prolongs the infection to make it worse so surely you'd have to end the movie with him 'turning'? Nope we get the movie ending with the girl looking as annoyed as ever and the guy just going into a house and shooting somebody. Earlier on he says something along the lines of I could never become one of those vigilantes it's sick. Errr? The infected also still seem to be able to think rationally and be quite coherent so the barb wire to keep them out obviously shouldn't work as I assume they'd be quite capable of walking up to the gate and opening it? if it was so affective then why not just put more where the gate was smashed down by the van and stay at the farm house?I give it 510.

The ominous music cues kept promising something that was never delivered. The actors may have uttered some interesting lines but if they did I certainly couldn't understand them. I like a grim bleak glimpse of the future as much as the next guy but the storytellers are still responsible for propelling the action forward whether it is physical or psychological.

Since the film was made for only a million bucks I expected Feast to be loaded with lots of things that would show that it was shot on a low budget. Well there wasn't any CGI special effects and 99 of this film was shot inside the bar but other than that I didn't feel anything else was compromised that would affect the quality of the film. In fact this film kicks more butt than most multimillion dollar horror and scifi flicks! Feast takes place inside a bar in the middle of the California desert. At one moment a bloodied man shows up with a dead creature in his hand. He says there are four of them he doesn't know what they are or where they came from except that they devour and kill anybody they see. Within minutes the creatures suddenly show up the carnage begins and all hell breaks loose.What I liked most about this film was the comical intros for all the lead characters hero loser expects nothing in life etc.Director John Gulager and one of the writers Marcus Dunstan chatted with the audience after the screening. According to John the film was scheduled for a January 2006 release. Unfortunately the turmoil at the film's distributors has put Feast on the shelf at least for now. Hopefully something could be done to get this film out to the public word of mouth is already out and Feast stands to make millions at the box office.".

It wasn't too long into the movie that I realized even if you watched every episode of Project Greenlight as I did you still don't see this coming. The movie was great! I sat back in my seat and went for a ride. It wasn't even 100 completed yet. A couple of scenes were too dark and it didn't have any credits. But it was so entertaining. They made this project for the horror genre and they aren't going to let anyone down. There is so much blood gore and action in this film. The action sequences were a sight to see on the big screen. I was truly blown away with how good everything came out. John was there with his girlfriend Diane and one of the writers. They did a QA after the screening and were very outgoing with the audience. After the screening they joined me and a bunch of Arizona talent at a nearby bar to hang out. He answered questions and was very cool to chat with. I hope they don't have any problems with getting this movie into theaters nation wide. It's a fun story with everything you want in a horror movie. You have to check it out when you get the chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Getting right to the point this movie was a huge letdown in my eyes. I have been making my way through some horror movies I had not seen yet May A Tale of Two Sisters etc... when I ran across this title. It was ranked on a lot of top horror movie lists but after watching I can honestly say I don't understand why. The filmmakers seem like they can't figure out what subgenre they want to end up with. This movie struggles between being a gore horror succeeding in some parts but overall trying too hard a dark comedy a bad one at that and a deeper movie than what it is by trying to develop character depth epic fail.I gave this movie some stars because it does manage to introduce some elements that could have been good if the movie wouldn't have had so many negative qualities. The gore succeeds at times but as I said before overall it feels forced and given the attempts at comedy and character development doesn't feel like a gore horror. The movie also gives brief biographies of each character but this becomes redundant after the first 34 and by the time they are all done you're wondering why they did so many. The cinematography is good in some areas when it is not shaking from cut scene to cut scene so fast that it makes you wonder if you are having a seizure or watching a movie.Sadly the monsters in this movie look too much like the creatures from the Alien series to give credit to the filmmakers. For the life of me I still see no reason why the monsters decide to wear clothing and bulls heads when the bull skulls don't even cover where their heads are located. Though a small gripe and not a defining factor for my rating it still bothers me that creatures which hump items at random eat humans whole and throw up on people have some sort of issue with not wearing clothing.If you're looking for a good horror movie and have not seen many I would recommend looking elsewhere. If you're simply a horror movie fan like myself who has seen many and is looking for something that has slipped through the cracks.....I'd still suggest looking elsewhere. If you're trying to prolong going to get that root canal done but have ran out of other things to procrastinate with though this is less painful. I give this movie a 410 because it simply takes itself too seriously to write it off as a dark comedy but not seriously enough to be a good horror movie.".

Though it would be easy for somebody to say that it is a metaphor for our day and time with terrorist threats and all but somebody even could do that with Cheaper by the Dozen. So anyway about Feast it's a great film to watch.The premise is very simple a bunch of strangers are locked in a bar for the night as monsters try and get in. There really isn't much more to it and that is where the beauty of this film lies. I have heard that Marcus one of the writers described this as a movie that you start watching on TBS at 2 am and you don't finish which is a great description for it. The performances are pretty strong because the actors seem so relaxed in them. The best performances come from Balthazar Getty Duane Whitaker Clu Gulgar Krista Allen and Josh Zuckerman. The work of the Thomas L Callaway the cinematographer is great especially in the final showdown scene some may complain about not being able to see but the red color that covers the scene is great. The final shot of Krista Allen behind the rising sun is just beautiful even if it is only a simple horror movie. The main credit goes to John Gulager whom despite all the drama shown on Project Greenlight has crafted a really enjoyable film. He took all the raw elements of the production and crafted just an amazing final product. This is a movie that I will suggest to people who just want to enjoy themselves in a theater.".

I don't know much about film distribution but it amazes and saddens me that this isn't in wide release ranking somewhere in the top 10 current films. Horror movies usually don't scare me but this one genuinely did. It was also really funny and the way the movie plays with character stereotypes had me guessing as to which character was going to get it next. There were moments when I was seriously shocked by the blatant violation of standard horror conventions. It takes real talent to play with clichs so effectively. Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a straight to video deal either this is a well crafted and filmed movie. If you like genre films like Evil Dead Tremors or just like horror in general you HAVE to check this one out if you get a chance. Unfortunately you may have to wait for DVD.".

At the least it's got cult classic written all over it campy smart writing quirky characters that are developed enough to give them dimension without plummeting the depths of their personalities it is a horror flick a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously outrageously funny more than you can say of other cult classics that have somehow survived...I haven't laughed out loud that much since Meet the Parents the original! totally scared the crap out of me numerous times a plot that defies predictability but doesn't collapse as a result of itAnd for all those reasons there's got to be a good chance it's at least going to be a sleeper hit...one that certainly appeals to the horror flick crowd but is smart enough to draw others like myself that are just looking for a great wellwritten wellproduced movie. Add the project greenlight junkies to that eclectic mix of audience draw...and tell me again why are the studios having trouble releasing it?".

At the least it's got cult classic written all over it campy smart writing quirky characters that are developed enough to give them dimension without plummeting the depths of their personalities it is a horror flick a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously outrageously funny more than you can say of other cult classics that have somehow survived...I haven't laughed out loud that much since Meet the Parents the original! totally scared the crap out of me numerous times a plot that defies predictability but doesn't collapse as a result of itAnd for all those reasons there's got to be a good chance it's at least going to be a sleeper hit...one that certainly appeals to the horror flick crowd but is smart enough to draw others like myself that are just looking for a great wellwritten wellproduced movie. Add the project greenlight junkies to that eclectic mix of audience draw...and tell me again why are the studios having trouble releasing it?";

I am not sure whether the word independent should be used for a film which required I assume voluntary donations? 'production' efforts from Harvey Weinstein Wes Craven Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Project GreenLight or not. It's really too bad that their hourly rates don't show up in the reported budgets for projects such as this  would help to clarify a lot of misunderstandings regarding the nature of allegedly independent supposedly lowbudget releases.  The cast is far from a group of of nobodies. Look them up right here on IMDb. For a supposed lowbudget film Feast relies very heavily on namerecognition and star power.John Gulager does a very nice job of telling a claustrophobic absurd but fun tale of terror and gore in Feast. It's an old story butin this case it's told very well. A bar full of archetypal jerks losers and heroes are startled by a wouldbe hero's Eric Dane violent bloodsoaked entry into the bar with a gun and an attitude. The hero announces that the bar is just about to be attacked by four angry monsters with razorsharp claws and teeth. The audience is almost immediately introduced to the film's audience participation game. Here are the unstated but easily understood challenges Understand that what is going to happen in this film is obvious and that we've seen it all before. The game is to figure out who gets it next If you're really good  try guessing how they are going to get it too. The casting editing and directing make this film worth watching. The script is fine for what it is but that isn't saying a whole lot. And the acting is uniformly good  again for what it is. Watching Henry Rollins ironically playing a selfhelp con artist with obvious problems of his own Clu Gallagher comically reprising the roll of the ancient bartender and erstwhile retired gunfighter in a very unlikely isolated desert context Balthazar Getty as the Town Jackass and Navi Rawat as the tough chick mom on a mission is well... just a lot of fun. The special effects are heavily digitized and there are a number of very noticeable 'digital moments'. I know I am supposed to say that the special effects were brilliant for the cost of the film but I do not trust the reported budget  I suspect that a lot of very expensive people were employed on a voluntary basis for this film and it is obvious that their time was not accounted for in the reported budget.Highly recommended for horror comedy fans and fans of the cast members. Not recommended for those who have difficulties with extremely disgusting gore and not recommended for those who do not recognize at least one or two of the major cast members.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like you I became interested in this film after watching Project Greenlight 3 and following the misadventures of 49 year old underdog John Gulager. Dimension Films had selected Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton's script for Feast to produce because it was the most marketable and they wanted a Project Greenlight film to turn a profit for once. Project Greenlight absolutely loathed the script and partially out of malice they selected Gulager as the director a filmmaker whose shorts were technically impressive and had a strange quality that seemed borne entirely from wholecloth but who was also incredibly shy and unassertive. The greenest of the green. After the film was completed everybody involved believed that the gamble paid off. I don't know perhaps they were willfully deceiving themselves. Feast is a mess the kind of mess that only a system as flawed as fundamentally flawed as Project Greenlight could have produced.Dunstan and Melton's script should have never seen the light of day. It evinces a real hatred for the cinema I mean they hate hate hate movies. They don't only hate movies of substance they hate movies that work. This isn't about not taking yourself seriously Dunstan and Melton seem to think a toaster is pretentious because it toasts bread like it's supposed to. Their notion of being clever is to tell us via freezeframes how long the characters are going to live and then alter the predictions through the course of the movie. Think about that. They don't expect you to automatically be familiar with these conventions they actively underline them for you and then violate them saying that you were stupid for buying into the conventions that they just underlined for you. The characters are flat and undefined and Dunstan and Melton underline this flatness by giving them names like Hero or Harley Mama while never infusing them with any archetypal significance as doing so would be predictable and thus unhip. If you ask me they're struggling to distract from the fact that they can't write believable threedimensional human characters and even worse that they really don't have anything that they want to say. Except I guess that movies are stupid and so we're not going to even bother to try to write a real one.And what about the monsters? They have sex and then the female instantly gives birth to an infant monster. Huh? I'm prepared to buy into a lot of things but I draw the line well before splitsecond gestations. Who are these monsters? Where are they coming from? Why are they attacking these people either on a literal level or a symbolic level? They are doing it for no other reason than to cover them in blood and slime and give the screenwriters a horror movie to feel superior to.But as bad as the script is I'm sad to say that there is still a whole lot of blood on Gulager's hands. Most shots in the film are held for no longer than four seconds and because Dunstan and Melton think themselves too cool to develop interesting characters that we care about and have filled the film with nothing but action sequences this quickly becomes exhausting. Gulager fills the film with jump scares one of the most effective but also one of the most cheap and primitive of audience manipulations. He uses so many that you walk away a little battered. The film is like a box of Lucky Charms with nothing but marshmallows. The ending is really good. Really really good. Purely on a filmmaking standard. The movie hasn't earned it. I hope that Gulager has some substance in him for his next film because he is totally unable to rely on style alone.".

You can see what they were going for campy overthetop comedy in the horror genre but they missed by a mile.Even knowing they had a very small budget they didn't come close to a quality product the acting was stiff and the editing was too abrupt.

You can see what they were going for campy overthetop comedy in the horror genre but they missed by a mile.Even knowing they had a very small budget they didn't come close to a quality product the acting was stiff and the editing was too abrupt.

From the great character bios some of the more gruesome deaths this film has its tongue firmly in its cheek. The cast are top notch with some of the best comedy moments coming from watching the surprise deaths. It breaks a lot of the horror rules with who survives and who doesn't. The gore and special effects are fantastic. The film itself is paced perfectly with very little explanation as to why or what exactly is happening. I love finding a film of this calibre. It shows that you don't need to remake a Asian film with a huge budget in order to make a good movie. Watch it and enjoy it!!!".

It needs to be seen by the public to get an interest back in the dying horror genre. It holds all the cards for redeeming the failures in horror earlier this year. I'll admit that I was very weary of what the script was doing at the very beginning of the movie making me think that it might be over and done with fairly quickly. The rest of the film was enough to completely redeem it though and kept me there and entertained the entire time.

	schema:reviewBody "Project Greenlight Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's reality series project was designed to let first time filmmakers show what they could do with a little bit of money and some support from real Hollywood professionals backing them up. Having never seen the show it is impossible to comment on how entertaining it is but thus far the actual films that resulted from the series have all been bombs that were largely met with critical derision. After having seen Feast the most recent product of the series it is now easy to understand why no one was impressed by the earlier entries if Feast is any indicator of the general quality of the Project Greenlight results it's terrible. If fact it is so far the worst movie to see the light of day in 2006 besting even the turgid Omen remake.Feast has been advertised as a horrorcomedy but it is in short supply of both elements although the fact that money was paid to actually view Feast could qualify as horrific. The film has the barest bones of a plot a group of strangers trapped in a bar surrounded by giant creatures that have an appetite for human flesh. As the night progresses the number of survivors gets whittled down as they attempt to fight back against the creatures with limited to zero success. Eventually the film ends and so does the torture of the viewer.What is wrong with Feast? It's easier to ask what is right with it. Not much. The film will feed the desire for anyone interested in blood and gore because it offers both aplenty. I suppose it is occasionally barely amusing and there are one or two effective shock scares. Everything else is just abominable. The film isn't the slightest bit creative in its plotting as this is about the umpteenth random strangers trapped in an isolated location with something after them film that has been made in the last few decades. The film is supposed to approach it all with a unique angle parodying this formula. If this is parody it would be enormously amusing to see something serious from these filmmakers. The humor is basically nonexistent and much of what is supposed to be clever is just dumb and obvious. The film does make one or two interesting choices as to who dies and when but a split second clever decision about what body goes next does not make for an entertaining film otherwise.The characters are so lacking in even the thinnest of personality and development that they are not even given real names just Call Signs of a sort including such wink wink monikers as Bossman Honey Pie Coach Beerman etc. The cast is comprised of a mixture of Blisters and nobodies including Henry Rollins Balthazar Getty Jason Mewes and a bunch of other people you have never heard of. There isn't really a good performance in the film it's all just stock horror acting. Technically the film isn't very well made either. Director John Gulager makes extensive use of the shakycam concept in action sequences making it nearly impossible to really tell what is going on. The makeup effects for the creatures are okay at times but from a distance the monsters move like they are realized by bad stopmotion animation.All this makes for an absolutely deadly dull film that seems to run on forever. You don't care about anyone the film is about as predictable as it gets and it isn't scary or suspenseful. What a winning formula. Did anybody read this script before giving it the go ahead? Why is Wes Craven's name attached to it? He at least should have been able to inform everybody involved that it was a complete waste. Perhaps the paycheck was too good.".

Reasons to see it It was written by Galton and Simpson writers of 'Hancock' and 'Steptoe and Son' on top form.It stars British comedy supergod Lionel Jeffries and is his finest hour and a half apart from directing 'The Railway Children'.It costars two other absolute gods of British cinema Laurence Harvey and Eric Portman. I don't think I've seen either of them in a comedy apart from this and I don't know why not because they're brilliant in it. Also Colin Blakely as the Russian premiere. And Denholm Elliott and Eric Sykes both of whom I'd completely forgotten about until I rewatched it which is a measure of how good the others are. And holding up the American end the colonel out of Bilko briefly.In a nutshell Jeffries is a downtrodden suburban family man and lowgrade spy with James Bond fantasies who masterminds a cunning scheme to obtain intelligence by surgically implanting a radio transmitter in a dog presented to the Russian leader the coldnosed spy of the title aided by Harvey as a hightone society vet with a terrible secret. Perhaps it's just Jeffries' ballpark resemblance to him but I was reminded a bit of some of S. J. Perelman's stuff that character he created for himself of the putupon shlub with delusions of grandeur and dreams of romance yanked out of his golden reveries by the banal importunities of wife and kids. But of course it's also a recurring character in British comedy  similar to the ones Galton and Simpson wrote so gloriously in Hancock and Steptoe but with an added dash of irritability  that character of the neurotic frustrated Napoleon of Suburbia  growing up everyone in Britain had a friend with a slightly scary Dad like this. Jeffries nails it here. Perhaps the funniest of the early scenes are the ones with him at home the tetchy paterfamilias overrun by his noisy children and wife June Whitfield 'Can't you control your spawn?' he snaps.While most of the comedy comes from the Jeffries character as I say Laurence Harvey is a comic revelation as a suave combination of gigolo and quack and the clash between them is great. It is very British and I suspect a bit oldfashioned for some people's tastes. Connoisseurs of Groovy London films should look out for one of those gratuitous popmusic and dance scenes the American producers insisted on inserting  in this case a completely unexplained sequence of Daliah Lavi dancing energetically by herself  but the swinging 60s elements are really just superimposed on a film that for the most part harks back to an earlier era.Anyway I found it hysterical and have no idea why it isn't better known. If you like this kind of thing then this is the kind of thing you'll love.".

To help with this plan Stanley blackmails a veterinarian by the name of Dr. Francis Trevelyon Laurence Harvey who has a predilection for the wives of his clients.

	schema:reviewBody "The Spy With A Cold Nose begins with an absurdly clever or is that cleverly absurd? idea but due to a sluggish script and Daniel Petrie's rather static direction it never really reaches the comic heights it was probably shooting for. Lionel Jeffries who is clearly the star of the film despite his third billing is amusing as a secret service agent who is pretty much the exact opposite of James Bond in every aspect but finally gets his one chance at fame or infamy if things go wrong. Daliah Lavi only appears after the first 40 minutes but burns up the screen as usual whether fullydressed or halfnaked Lavi is curvy and sexy. The film on the whole is pleasant and easy to take but not much more than that. Terrific score by Riz Ortolani.  out of 4.".

For good measure it also sports easily the most ridiculous monster in the history of film! The plot is so thin that it can't even be stretched comfortably over the film's 66minute running time without generous padding. A family headed by the requisite Germanaccented scientist and including a hot chick a manly guy and two cutesypoo kids wander through the desert after Earth has been annihilated by a guy in a gorilla suit wearing a plastic diving helmet. That's basically it except for some nonsensical pap about an immunity serum. When the guy in the monkey suit is far and away the best actor in the picture you've got a MAJOR problembut compared to John Mylong as The Professor RoMan is Laurence Olivier. You could drive a semi through the plot holes. The dialogue clangers pile up like horseshoes on George H.W. Bush's lawn. You feel embarrassed for director Phil Tucker and almost ashamed to laugh at this movie when you learn that the bad reviews of the film drove him to attempt suicide. The experience of watching this film even with its abnormally short running time is so excruciating that it feels like you've wasted five hours of your life. It's so bad that after a while you begin to marvel at its very badness and ultimately you come away awestricken.I call it a masterpiece because under normal circumstances only a talented and determined genius could make a film that sinks as low and violates so many rules of filmmaking storytelling and suspension of disbelief as this one does. It takes real talent to make Ed Wood look like Stanley Kubrick but Phil Tucker pulled it off. For that alone he deserves a place in film history.".

Suspend your belief for a moment. Disregard the nonexistent production values which after all are merely a vehicle to deliver the story the bubbles the TV antenna the wooden radio and really consider the idea of a terrible invader that has destroyed everyone on the planet except for the last few people struggling futilely to survive against an undefeatable foe and don't laugh remember we are suspending the idea that a slowly lumbering man in a gorilla suit with a fake diving helmet could not possibly be scary. I find the bleakness the isolation the desperation the futility of an unwinnable fight to be deeply affecting.Now if you throw into the mix that everything is as would be imagined by a young child a child whose imagination has been fueled by the huge spread of comic books that bookend the movie you can realize this film is not the laughable failure everyone makes it out to be. Well I guess it is but there's at least in part a legitimate reason for it. The horrible plot holes and cheesy acting all fall into place. The unbelievable yet somehow Freudian almostromance of Alice and RoMan. Even the Neenerneenerneener melody from the very beginning and very ending of Elmer Bernstein's surprisingly powerful moodsetting score fits perfectly into a story set inside the mind of an eightyearold.Let's face it most socalledgood SF movies have the same kind of overlynarrow tunnel vision where an enormous story is microscoped down to focus unrealistically on a very few number of characters. Most bigname SF movies don't have any fewer scientific or technical absurdities. I don't know about you but to me a lot of big budget blockbuster SFaction films these days don't have any better acting or plot. Take The Core which in my opinion is effectively an inferior remake of the silly yet fascinating Unknown World. And let's be honest the awkward romantic scenes in this movie were nowhere near as bad as the laboured wooden and completely unbelievable romance Star Wars Episode II. RoMan's sililoquy about the conflict of duty and desire would stand side by side with many of the best quotes from Star Trek.It's easy to shoot this obscure little film down for its lack of any real sets and props which were probably dug out of someone's garage the mostly bad acting and silly plot but I'd watch this movie a dozen times before sitting through one of the many highbudget lowbrow effectsdriven stinkburgers that are inevitably disgorged from Hollywood every summer despite them having had 50 years to supposedly know better. Is this movie really any worse than the aforementioned The Core? Spawn? Event Horizon? Independence Day? Armageddon? How are any of these any better minus perhaps the special effects? My conclusion is that they really aren't. Is it really fair to criticize the cheap twist at the end that it was all a dream? This same plot device that has since fueled countless comic books and TV shows and more amazingly a whole season of Dallas or in the case of St. Elsewhere and Newhart an entire TV show. Doesn't that really make you want to go back and reconsider what you have seen in a new light?In comparison I think Robot Monster comes across more like a episode of Twilight Zone... if you really look at the world the movie tries to create you can't help but think at least a little. All I could think about after those other movies was how bad they were. Maybe it's just me. Maybe my vision and taste has been warped by being a longtime junkie of Mystery Science Theater 3000 whose skewering of awful movies including this one has given me a taste for inept preachy andor shoddilyproduced cinema a taste that has further encouraged by the easy availability of bargainbin collections of old Bmovies that are coming out as fast as they can laser images of scratched and dusty cellulose onto Taiwanese silveredplastic. Or maybe this movie somehow transcends its absurd cheapness its winceinducing stereotypes its heavyhanded and forced drama to give us a brief peek into the deepseated hopes desires and fears that might have inhabited the fragile psyche of a child growing up in Cold War America.OK it's probably me.".

RoMan's sililoquy about the conflict of duty and desire would stand side by side with many of the best quotes from Star Trek.It's easy to shoot this obscure little film down for its lack of any real sets and props which were probably dug out of someone's garage the mostly bad acting and silly plot but I'd watch this movie a dozen times before sitting through one of the many highbudget lowbrow effectsdriven stinkburgers that are inevitably disgorged from Hollywood every summer despite them having had 50 years to supposedly know better. Is this movie really any worse than the aforementioned The Core? Spawn? Event Horizon? Independence Day? Armageddon? How are any of these any better minus perhaps the special effects? My conclusion is that they really aren't. Is it really fair to criticize the cheap twist at the end that it was all a dream? This same plot device that has since fueled countless comic books and TV shows and more amazingly a whole season of Dallas or in the case of St. Elsewhere and Newhart an entire TV show. Doesn't that really make you want to go back and reconsider what you have seen in a new light?In comparison I think Robot Monster comes across more like a episode of Twilight Zone... if you really look at the world the movie tries to create you can't help but think at least a little. All I could think about after those other movies was how bad they were. Maybe it's just me. Maybe my vision and taste has been warped by being a longtime junkie of Mystery Science Theater 3000 whose skewering of awful movies including this one has given me a taste for inept preachy andor shoddilyproduced cinema a taste that has further encouraged by the easy availability of bargainbin collections of old Bmovies that are coming out as fast as they can laser images of scratched and dusty cellulose onto Taiwanese silveredplastic. Or maybe this movie somehow transcends its absurd cheapness its winceinducing stereotypes its heavyhanded and forced drama to give us a brief peek into the deepseated hopes desires and fears that might have inhabited the fragile psyche of a child growing up in Cold War America.OK it's probably me.";

As a man well aware of his limits Nader doesn't usually bother with acting. Like most of the cast members of Robot Monster he simply recites his lines and adds a smile a chuckle or a gesture here and there.It gets worse. I am a professional archaeologist and though I appreciate the credit this film gives my profession I sincerely doubt that any archaeologist will ever develop a serum that makes humans immune to every possible form of disease. Furthermore I have ethical concerns about the fact that he tests it on HIS ENTIRE FAMILY even if doing so allowed them to be the only survivors of the alien holocaust brought about by Roman! I guess this makes Robot Monster a pioneering cyberpunk film since the entire plot takes place after the destruction of most of earth's life. Most of the plot is incoherent utterly ridiculous and unexplained.You continue to watch because despite the mediocre cinematography worse than mediocre directing and script you want to see just how much worse it can get. In that sense this film is no disappointment. It gives Manos a run for its money but in the end does no harm and its a lot more fun so I gave it a two the extra star is for being harmless. This is an amazingly goofy and silly film comparable in its absurdity to Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. Go for it if you're into that kind of thing or if you harbor a secret desire to see George Nader get married without a shirt in a ceremony performed by a German archaeologist.".

Robot Monster is the type of SciFi that will bring back memories of your childhood and overall a fun movie to watch.Where else can you find such lines as You look like a pooped out pinwheel. Humans listen to me. Due to an error in calculation there are still a few of you left. ...you just can't find great lines like that anymore!

A typical Alienfromouterspaceheretodestroytheworld type movie fans of the old SciFi's and many Monster Kids will no doubt enjoy watching Robot Monster late at night.As strange as it sounds for as bad as the movie is it also has that something that makes it enjoyable and fun to watch...again and again and again. Robot Monster is the type of SciFi that will bring back memories of your childhood and overall a fun movie to watch.Where else can you find such lines as You look like a pooped out pinwheel. Humans listen to me. Due to an error in calculation there are still a few of you left. ...you just can't find great lines like that anymore! If you are able to release your imagination and enjoy a movie without being too critical of its obvious shortcomings and flaws this is a real treat.";

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw this in the '60s I managed to catch clips off of a late night Creature Feature that cut the crap out of the movie to insert commercials. Thus it made little sense. However the images that I did see never left me and I have been haunted with the desire to see it again in its entirety. Over the years I managed to catch even more clips but never the entire movie. Nevertheless I was still intrigued by a certain something. Finally I just flat out bought the DVD.I watched it twice in a row and discovered that this is really quite a little gem. When you finally realize what is going on which I certainly won't tell you it makes perfect sense in a 1953 flavor. The important thing to remember is that it is from a child's limited experience and point of view. Once that is realized it becomes great fun.Perhaps the best part is Elmer Bernstein's score. It kind of does for this movie what Max Stein did for 'King Kong'. The mood is set. Things become a bit surreal and eerie. You become unbalanced. This is good because upon first viewing it throws you a curve and suddenly you aren't in Kansas anymore. How did this happen? It isn't explained until the end but all at once we have stock footage of dinosaurs fightingboth actual lizards and stopmotion animated models and a large armadillo walking through the scene. Why? It makes no sense....at first. It is certainly a bit upsetting to your reality though.Then we discover that the entire word's population is gone with the exception of a handful of people because of Roman and ensemble taking over the world. As you know Roman is a guy in a gorilla suit sans gorilla head which is replaced by a goofy space helmet. He has a bubble machine for some reason and a communication device at the entrance of this cave. His mission is to kill off the rest of the remaining humans. Piece o cake? Nope. Crafty humans have accidentally figured a way to cloak their exact location.The acting is not good but I have the strangest feeling it was completely on purpose to unbalance the viewer. The same holds true for much of the logic. But in the end that is OK when you discover what has really happened. As soon as that is revealed you will groan and wonder what you missed that might have explained this earlier in the film. No you didn't miss anything. The movie leads you where it wants you to go and reveals nothing until it wants you to know. Then if you're dedicated you will watch it again and perhaps enjoy it much more like I did. I also discovered that while it is logically lame it is never flat out stupid. There really is a method to the filmmaker's madness here.This movie is cheesy and cheap  it probably wouldn't have worked any other way. Because of Bernstein's music and some of the work by the sound department this movie can even raise your sense of unease. This is good! It doesn't try to scare the Hell out of you but tries to convey a story  which is somewhat interesting from a 1953 point of view.Bottomline I personally like this movie and will see it again. I think David Lynch should try a remake. It has some of the same qualities as some of his films for developing a sense of the surreal.I give it a 4.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hesitate to give this a 1 for awful but it is  by all memories of all the bad films I ever saw  the worst I ever saw. The Medved Brothers back in the 1980s listed Robot Monster among the 50 worst films of all time. It deserves that accolade. With dialog serious dialog like I am not a human...I am a Ro  Man. said by an actor in a gorilla suit George Barrows the actor in the gorilla suit actually played a gorilla in another film in a few years  it must have been one of his socalled talents this is the nadir I almost said Nader for the star of the film of bad movie making. It is povertyrow movie making.I notice the name of Ed Wood mentioned in some of the reviews here. Wood never did a good film but there was I believe a man in Wood who really felt he had some type of cinematic vision. It was not a trained one  it was quite inept. But if you look at what Wood is attempting to do in some of his films in the 1950s tackle crossdressing in Glen Or Glenda for example one can vaguely sympathize with his having some concepts but no talent to really put them across. I think that is why Wood has somehow become a negative Hollywood legend. That can't be said for Phil Tucker. He never seems to have gotten the bug of making just monster movies. When Wood planned Plan Nine From Outer Space he did intend to comment about the danger of our arms race it comes out ludicrously in the film but it is there. Tucker could not do that. He just could push together the typical hack like conventions to muddle through. So he has the heroine vamp the Robot Monster no matter how idiotic it looks. I have never seen Tucker's Cape Canaveral Monster which was his last film but I suspect it is just a slightly smoother version of the bilge he put together here.I do have one suspicion that makes me think this film was just a poverty row quickie without rhyme or reason not like Wood's type of schlock which he actually agonized over at home and when filming. I noticed while looking through the credits the backgrounds and fates of the different players. The only one who went anywhere in the 1950s was George Nader who actually may have done a good performance in one film Away All Boats but whose career petered out due to his getting involved in a homosexual scandal. He ended doing television in Germany. This film actually was his first real lead role. Barrows never had as important a role in a film as Robot Monster. Selena Royle had done some important films in the 1940s but she was blacklisted possibly unfairly. She did make a successful second career in Mexico which I am glad about. John Brown was also a victim of the blacklist. Few know of it today despite the decades of reruns of the old Burns and Allen television show but he was on the show for a few months in 1950 replacing Hal March as the neighbor Harry Morgan. Brown who had a distinguished career in radio comedy shows like The Life Of Riley was replaced by producer George Burns when his sponsor pointed out that Brown was suspected of communist sympathies. He would be replaced by Fred Clark. It is the shows with Clark and later Larry Keating that we have seen to this day. Brown kept working when he could. He died in 1957. Claudia Barrett's career died out in the 1960s. As for the two child performers Gregory Moffett acted until about 1956 and Pamela Paulson never made another film in her life. John Mylong usually played bitparts in films frequently during World War II as Nazis he's in The Hitler Gang. He does play Eddie Duchin's Tyrone Power's father in The Eddie Duchin Story.In short this cast is strictly from hunger in terms of name recognition. All that is except the future acting success Nader and the past success Royle and this is a rung up for the former and a last chance for the latter. When Tucker cast this picture he grabbed people who were desperate to be in anything that offered them a chance to have a speaking part of any type no matter how silly. Now compare this with Woods  he uses Bela Lugosi again and again because he recognizes that Lugosi has name recognition with the public and some degree of talent left as well though drug addiction made the latter even weaker than it was. He also uses some character actors like Lyle Talbot who have been around for awhile the Medveds don't think highly of Talbot as he seems somewhat humorless  actually at about the same time he worked for Wood Talbot appeared as himself in a comic series of rivalry confrontations with Bob Cummings on the latter's successful television series Love That Bob!. Wood also used local television stars like Vampira and Cresswell the mentalist and Tor Johnson the Swedish wrestler in his films. In short Wood looks like he made an effort to choose his cast with something approaching thought for effect for what he thought was talent. The results might have been laughable but it showed a type of care. Tucker didn't show that. So for all the cheesiness of Wood's works we can admire the attempt. We can't with Tucker.The most memorable moment of this movie? The booming voice deciding to unleash prehistoric monsters on the planet we see some kind of lizard roaming a small set  it's supposed to be a tyrannosaur?. I think it was memorable because it came about two minutes before the film ended. It still came two minutes too late.".

You see the Robot Monsters have destroyed civilization except for a family of five people and one boy friend who are immune to detection by the monsters due some kind of cure all antibiotic.The family includes the father John Mylong the mother Selena Royle a scientist daughter Alice Claudia Barrett her boy friend Roy George Nader and two younger kids a boy Johnny Gregory Moffat and a girl Carla Pamela Paulson.We're supposed to believe that the monster and his chief The Great One no not Jackie Gleason control the entire world from an isolated cave with incredibly cheap looking scientific instruments. And then there's those flashbacks to dinosaurs and lizards made to look like dinosaurs. The same sequences from stock footage no doubt are repeated a couple of times. I guess if you saw this film in 3D it might hold some bit of interest. But in 2D nothing.George Nader actually survived this turkey and went on to bigger and better things at Universal as a contract player.Absolutely awful and well deserving of the dreaded 1.".

	schema:reviewBody "MOON MONSTERS COME TO EARTH AND ATTACK AND KILL ALL HUMANS!!! Quite possibly one of the most infamous movies of all time let alone a prime example of a well done so bad it's good movie Robot Monster puts all other movies to shame literally. RoMan the main antagonist in Robot Monster is a sexstarved gorillasuit diving helmet monster contraption that has destroyed all of humanity with the exception of a group of survivors which coincidentally happen to be a family. But little do they know that this horrific creature is coming to kill them off and steal their women once and for all. Sounds like a pretty good premise right? Actually this was a typical 50's SciFi premise for most of the SciFi movies made during that time.In all seriousness this film lacks acting creativity with the monster to a degree and pretty much everything in between. A micro budget film with a short run time this film to most critics would probably be given anywhere between 3 to no stars. But I am not like most critics. Being only 21 I have literally immersed myself in almost 1000 different movies in the past 6 years. But Robot Monster for some reason seems to be one hell of a masterpiece. You may be asking why in the hell I would think this film is a masterpiece if it's rated at a 2.8 on here 31 by critics and 41 by users on Rotten Tomatoes. Well how about it?Although this film is a complete nuclear disaster it shines as being one of the best bestworst movies I have ever seen. Much like the infamous Creeping Terror which would be released some 11 years later would put Robot Monster near the top of the goodbad chain. But just how bad can you get?Robot Monster undoubtedly is one of the most hilarious and entertaining movies I have had the pleasure of screening. It gets the job done with zero screams and many laughs but really was meant to scare the pants off of you. As I have said before I am a very young movie critic with an interest in some of the oldest and cheesiest films of all time. This happens to be Gouda cheese quality see what I did there? I will award it no stars to keep other Zmovie lovers like myself happy to find movies with a low rating but in a B to Z critic standpoint I would award it 10 out of 10 stars. A fine example of putting two unlikely things together and making a fine piece of crap along the way.".

This was in no way as good or as funny as American Pie 2 or American Wedding nor was it as groundbreaking as American Pie. But there were certainly a lot of laughs. I was impressed at the acting of the guy who played Stiffler's younger brother.As someone who basically grew up with the American Pie movie series I'll always enjoy those movies and watch them with a sense of nostalgia for I was in similar points in my life to all the characters at the times the moview were originally released. For that reason this movie actually made me feel old.Anyway I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and am considering adding it to the collection. I'd say it's a solid 78 out of 10. Definitely worth watching but not quite the caliber of the original three.".

The situations here are not unfamiliar but most of the cast is. This leaves you at least at first trying to figure out the character dynamics. Fortunately its not hard since little imagination has gone into this effort.Stiffler magically acquires a younger brother that forms the main character of the film. To be fair Tad Hilgenbrink does a pretty good Stiffler impression but that's where the problem lies. He is so much like The Stiffler that its difficult not to look at the situations and dialogue and think...this story was written for Sean William Scott.Overall the film is a subpar rehash of the kind of comedy that made American Pie good. The fact that none of the major stars of the original are onboard again just kind of makes me think that it wasn't good enough. Maybe this was a script too far. Of course the original actors are all too old to convincingly play the characters they once were. But as American Wedding showed the franchise can evolve beyond the school years given a sufficient driving force.Anyway Band Camp is easily the weakest of the Pie films to date and will do absolutely nothing to keep the franchise going. And perhaps if this clumsy rehash of ideas is anything to go by its a franchise that should be allowed to fade away.".

You can name twenty characters Stifler if you want it doesn't change the fact that this is a rather uninspired effort to cash in which bizarrely works. You can judge it standing by itself but just keep in mind it was never intended to stand by itself. So here Stifler's brother Matt who's not even the same guy from American Pie 2 is punished for pulling an on all levels pretty lame prank. The Sherminator meanwhile has become a school counselor and sends him to band camp which as it turns out currently employs Jim's Dad. It's like bad fan fiction came to life. So naturally he pulls more pranks on the rivals like two. They get back at him like once. The rest is filled up with very bothersome references to the actual American Piemovies seminaked chicks and extremely irritating love subplots including a horrendously clichd nerd you just can't possibly side with. Add a last fifteen minutes that's like the Siberian prison edit of Family Matters and you start wondering why it's still somewhat enjoyable. Perhaps it's the presence of Eugene Levy in yet another movie he's too talented for. The sunscreen gag was pretty good too I guess. This American Pie presents crap needs to end though even if you don't give any thought to how a movie can present anything it's still a thorn in the eye to the franchise.".

You can judge it standing by itself but just keep in mind it was never intended to stand by itself. So here Stifler's brother Matt who's not even the same guy from American Pie 2 is punished for pulling an on all levels pretty lame prank. The Sherminator meanwhile has become a school counselor and sends him to band camp which as it turns out currently employs Jim's Dad. It's like bad fan fiction came to life. So naturally he pulls more pranks on the rivals like two. They get back at him like once. The rest is filled up with very bothersome references to the actual American Piemovies seminaked chicks and extremely irritating love subplots including a horrendously clichd nerd you just can't possibly side with. Add a last fifteen minutes that's like the Siberian prison edit of Family Matters and you start wondering why it's still somewhat enjoyable. Perhaps it's the presence of Eugene Levy in yet another movie he's too talented for. The sunscreen gag was pretty good too I guess. This American Pie presents crap needs to end though even if you don't give any thought to how a movie can present anything it's still a thorn in the eye to the franchise.";

The lessons Stifler's brother learns about bandies I think they called them in the movie and about his brother's attitude are what I remember from this movie. Also the bands used in the movie are actually all members of the prestigious Riverside Community College marching band and the music was arranged by a brass arranger for Drum Corps International. Granted I have been to band camp and it is still 95 nothing like the band camp presented in the movie but it's also not completely off. Yes I have been to band camp. Yes we got drunk but not in crazy snocone parties where everybody took their shirts off. No this movie was not a cinematic masterpiece.

It's just one of those teenmovies with jokes tricks girls and boys sex and a whole lot of partying. One of the best movies in the American Pie series. It's a pity that all the old characters have moved on however the new characters were just as good as the old ones.";

When she first told me she had gotten this for me and that she hoped I hadn't bought it I was tempted to say 'Yeah like I'd waste money on this piece of crap!' she brought it over I popped it into the DVD player with zero expectations figuring I could trade it in later.I have just finished the movie and am I ever grateful that not only she got me this movie but that I watched it. This movie is without a doubt an amazing edition to the American Pie series.Our story begins with Matt Stiffler Steve Stiffler's kid brother trying so desperately to follow in his big brother's footsteps. We find out that Steve has become the next Larry Flynt as he is now prominent in the porno business. Matt and his fellow degenerates look up to Steve as if he were a god doing their best to emulate the elder Stiffler. They decide during graduation to sabotage the band using pepper spray on their instruments to some amazing results unfortunately for Mr. Stiffler Jr he's caught literally with his pants down.Our favorite geek The Shermanator now a guidance counselor gives Matt an ultimatum Band Camp or Expulsion. The hijinks go from there.Series veterans Eugene Levy and Chris Owen reprise their roles as Jim's Dad and Chuck 'Shermanator' Sherman respectfully and take the American Pie series in an all new direction.I enjoyed the way they paid respect to the past with the honorable mentions of Jim Michelle and of course 'The Stiffmeister' as well as their exploits. However it also shows the negative effect that Steve had on Matt who actually shows he can be a likable guy when not trying to follow in big brother's foot steps.Throw in the pranks and sexual nature that made the Meatballs series and Little Darlings cult hits and you've got American Pie Band Camp. I don't understand the negative reviews surrounding this movie. Maybe I am too lenient with movies but I seriously think you should ignore the negative hype and check out this movie because all in all it is a great movie and very well done. Usually movies are sent straight to video because of crappy acting editing and even worse plot. However this movie has great acting with Tad Hilgenbrinck delivering an excellent performance as Matt Stiffler and it helps that he looks a good bit like Sean William Scott also lip curl and all and the supporting cast does amazingly well.So check out American Pie Band Camp because it deserves a lot of credit and a lot of props. However let's hope they don't do anymore...because it's easy for things to go downhill.1010".

And the script such as it is is literally built entirely around a one line joke from the original movie. So if you thought 'Pat the Movie' and 'Stuart Smiley Saves The World' were brilliant comedic gems then this is the flick for you.

Every 20 minutes it seemed like he scored.The fact that there were a few porn stars among the cast helped. Ol' Darby wasn't the ONLY guy getting' lucky here.This had more of a breast fetish than 'Stacey.' For that alone most men will dig it. But this film was as realistic as your average ATeam episode.

Darby Hinton the star of the film..modeled after the looks of a Jameson Parker or Chuck Norrisis all smiles as well as he should be considering the amount of ladies who offer their bodies to him as a private eye put on the case of uncovering the identity of the person behind selling computer chip secrets to the Russians. Soon he is involved in uncovering the person involved in the murder of a butler  driver who was blackmailing the household of a rich wheelchair bound aristocrat Lady Lillian ChamberlainNiki Dantine.It all ties to a businessman whose being supplied monetary funds from Lady Lillian's daughter LizaLorraine Michaels. He sends his muscle after CodyHinton needing to recover some film shot by ShaneBrett Clark the butler before he died after the killer shot and stabbed him. The film has the face of the killer who was escaping after removing a tape from Shane's video recorder. Sybil Danning has a minor role as Contessa Luciana an agent who not only hires Cody but is one of his manylovers as well. Well Danning is here basically to show a little skin mostly in a teeny bikini or gowns which are designed to showcase her figure and big jugs. Practically the entire female cast hired by Sidaris are nude models and Playboy bunnies and Cody gets plenty of action..as does Clark who not only beds Lady Lillian's daughter Liza but her daughterinlaw Anita played by Shelley Taylor Morgan as wellin the process.Thrown in the mix is this family of hicks who constantly challenge Cody to street races and a female cop BeverlyLori Sutton who assists him in his case..among other things. Unveiled as Cody works on the case is that Lillian's son StuartMichael A Andrews married to Anita is gay..and moonlights as a transvestite one of three Shane was attempting to extort. Cody's affair with a race car driver June Khnockers..yuck yuck is played for laughs when he uses her vehicle to evade the trio of assassins after the role of film..Lynda Wiesmeier is always pulling out her tits often getting the attention she seeks after. Another gag is two honeys who have a boat docked on the same harbor as Cody always calling on him for a little hanky panky with him often too busy to take them up on their offers.

Nonetheless Malibu Express has a lot of scantily clad ladies along the way is constantly moving at full speed and packed with comedy situations sometimes as ludicrous as a Russ Meyer movie.

But while this might sound like Bmovie heaven in Sidaris's hands it all proves rather tiresome the deliberate trashiness becoming really boring really quick.The plot to Malibu Express comes second to the macho posturing and female nudity so I won't go into detail other than to say that it's about industrial espionage and it's crapnot that the action is much better consisting of poorly choreographed fight scenes unconvincing shootouts and the occasional car chase.

Of course in my opinion his only other watchable movie was Hard Ticket To Hawaii anyway Malibu Express has some okay action sequences Even though Hinton's martial arts sequences are badly staged and features tons of nudity which is the film's main selling point. The story is completely plot less and extremely hard to follow mainly due to the fact that none of the plot threads are ever pursued in a way that would make this work as a mystery. In fact the ending merely explains the outcome because the movie forgets to connect the dots earlier. Basically this is a plot less and rather goofy affair which works better as comedy than it does as action or mystery.  Out of 4Fair".

	schema:reviewBody "What a change of pace this movie is as compared with its genre today. I'm no old fogey but would that modern directors become smart enough take several pages from its book.The Bullit character is a precursor of Dirty Harry but a bit more cerebral. Stylistically the director sets the stage beautifully for McQueen's Bullit. The movie has a European feel director Peter Yates is a Brit and achieves its dark mood through quiet understatement. The musical score for instance. Today music is overly used overly loud and manipulative. i.e. in case you are not moved by this scene here are a division of amplified violins to remind you to weep. In 'Bullit' the music is sparingly used and doesn't intrude at all. It complements the directorial style without setting the agenda.The feeling of reserved naturalism is achieved through editing and dialogue. There really aren't very many lines in the movie and when characters do speak they are very succinct. Notice the last 1520 minutes of the movie most of which takes place at the airport. Hardly a line in it. There is none of the chattiness so prevalent today especially post Pulp Fiction which is so tedious unless the script is tiptop which is rare.Editing is perhaps its greatest strong point. The many long edits deserve equal credit with the dialogue in setting the lowkey mood. The cinema verite dialogue of the airport scenes and say the scene where McQueen and Don Gordon search the trunk combined with the long cuts add greatly to understated feel while adding realism.And the performances are top notch. The spare script helps McQueen shine since the taciturn moodiness fits his persona to a tee. There are very fine performances from all of the supporting cast from Don Gordon to Bisset to Fell to Duvall to Oakland. This is a great movie for watching faces. Note the expressions of the hit men during the chase scene just another example of this movie letting the little touches speak volumes.The chase scene certainly deserves its billing as one of the best in movie history. Recently 'The Transporter' was lauded for its opening chase sequence. The one in 'Bullit' is a marvel compared. In 'The Transporter' sequence I'm not sure there is a cut that lasts more than three seconds. In 'Bullit' it is again the editing which sets it apart here. The long edits give you the feel of acceleration and deceleration of tire smoke and gears of wind and the roller coaster San Francisco streets. You are given the time to place yourself in the frame. In short 'Bullit' uses real craftsmanship. Films like 'The Transporter' use hundreds of quick edits to mimic the danger and immediacy of 'Bullit' but it comes across as hot air confusion instead of clarity. The two scenes are perfect set pieces of easy and hollow Mtvstyle flash versus real directorial substance.".

Calling your hero Bullitt might seem an unsubtle way to emphasise his macho qualities but in fact Steve MacQueen plays him as a quiet man not some wisetalking maverick he does what he has to do but takes no pleasure in his actions and survives the roughness of his work not by becoming a monster but simply by becoming a little less human. It's a believable portrait and the film as a whole has a procedural feel there are action scenes but these are kept in their place in the overall design.Today the film is most famous for its celebrated car chase which makes excellent use as indeed does the movie as a whole of the bay area locations but is not actually shot that excitingly the conclusion at the airport is more original though it roots the film in the time when it was permissible to take a loaded gun onto a plane. But overall this is still a classy film dry exciting and bleak and among the very best films of its day. William Friedkin's brilliant 'The French Connection' made a short while afterwards would appear to owe it a debt.".

Steve did not have to jabber in every scene to dominate this film.  The car chase is unequaled to this day. How  can anything on the road in later years compare to the muscle cars of the late 60s? But Steve was the star make no mistake and even though the dialogue was minimal it was enough. Steve McQueen had that power on the screen. He remains one of Hollywood's best even though he passed away over twenty years ago.  We  will not see the likes of him  for many more years. Women loved  him men  loved him too. If you have not seen many of his films watch any you  can. Watch him in Tom Horn 1980 and Papillon 1973. Try  The Getaway 1972 Junior Bonner 1972and the humorous The Reivers 1969. Of course The Sand Pebbles 1966   The  Great Escape 1963 and the ever classic  The Magnificent Seven1960 are among his most popular films.  You never  go wrong with any of these.".

Justly heralded for its tremendous car chasea tribute to legendary driver Bill Hickman arguably the finest of all motion picture driversthe film as well captures the feel of gritty detective work in a form that has been copied frequently since but rarely if ever equaled. The film is a delight as a period piece the easygoing already laidback Bay area culture of the late 1960's and early 1970's the tension between the cool vaguely antiestablishment Bullitt and the straightlaced local officials and department heads that he finds himself compelled to work with. The other actors are themselves a superb supporting cast oldtimers like Simon Oakland Norman Fell an oily and vaguely Bobby Kennedyish Robert Vaughn and Don Gordon as Bullitt's longsuffering but intensely loyal partner. But as well there are memorable newcomers George Sanford Brown as an overworked doctor Robert Duvall as a sharp taxi driver and Jacqueline Bisset as Bullitt's trophy architectgirlfriend. Lalo Schifrin contributed a superb memorable scorejust the right mix of jazz and brass and percussion. And of course that glorious Mustang. . . .!!! Not to be missed!!!!!".

The film is a delight as a period piece the easygoing already laidback Bay area culture of the late 1960's and early 1970's the tension between the cool vaguely antiestablishment Bullitt and the straightlaced local officials and department heads that he finds himself compelled to work with. The other actors are themselves a superb supporting cast oldtimers like Simon Oakland Norman Fell an oily and vaguely Bobby Kennedyish Robert Vaughn and Don Gordon as Bullitt's longsuffering but intensely loyal partner. But as well there are memorable newcomers George Sanford Brown as an overworked doctor Robert Duvall as a sharp taxi driver and Jacqueline Bisset as Bullitt's trophy architectgirlfriend. Lalo Schifrin contributed a superb memorable scorejust the right mix of jazz and brass and percussion. And of course that glorious Mustang. . . .!!! Not to be missed!!!!!";

	schema:reviewBody "...from from rogue cops who make their own rules to... rogue cops who seriously know how to put the pedal to the medal. Only Bogie and John Wayne were cinematic tough guys before Frank Bullitt came along and it was Bullitt that inspired Dirty Harry and every rogue cop movie as a result. If you were looking for the first modern cop thriller well here it is. Accept no substitutes. In today's overblown and effects laden for better of for worse era people often forget that all those films began with movies like this one.The story has Lieutenant Frank Bullitt receiving an assignment to protect a star witness in a high profile case that could bring down a powerful crime organization. Bullitt and his men take turns guarding the witness but before long there is a hit and the witness is mortally wounded and Bullitt takes the case into his own hands. The resulting mystery is both GradeA Hollywood entertainment rare these days and a believable character portrait of a man engulfed by his work in a cruel world.Of course one cannot talk about his movie without mentioning the legendary car chase which is one of the best out there but is not the main part of the movie as many make it out to be. If you see this movie just for some pedal to the medal action you will be let down. The focus of the movie is on Bullitt and the car chase while very exciting and fun to watch is one of the many scenes that show Bullitt's near obsession to work. Unlike today's crap action movies there is no 37 car pile up no cars flipping over simply because the bad guys are driving them.Also the finale of the film a foot chase at an airport has our hero firing two shots from his pistol and that is the only time he uses it in the movie. This film demonstrates that action is best when the result of a character's emotions and not a director's ambition to blow stuff up. Bullitt wants to get the bottom of the case he wants to find out who's been following him around town and that is the result of the action scenes. In the end the film is a true classic and Frank Bullitt is a character to remember. 1010Rated PG violence though if it were released today it probably would get a PG13".

Bullitt is a complete professional who never takes his eye off the objective no matter how much interference he encounters from his superiors or from Robert Vaughan's scheming politician Walter Chalmers.  And Bullitt unlike Doyle or Callahan operates without the histrionics.  No oneliners no yelling and screaming tantrums from this officer.  You may not like him very much but you have to respect his dedication to duty and you'll quickly share his absolute contempt for Chalmers.Bullitt is best remembered for its spectacular car chase in which McQueen reportedly did most of his own driving.  But this is not primarily an action film.  Aside from the chase and the final shootout at SFO there's not a lot of violence.  Most of the attention is on Bullitt's maneuvering to unravel the mystery and to keep Chalmers off his back.   Recommended if you like McQueen or policiers in general.  The pace may be a little slow for people under 30 who are used to a more slambang less cerebral approach to this sort of thing but Bullitt is still worth your time.  Just don't expect Lethal Weapon.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS sort of.Bullitt seems to be remembered mostly for the central car chase which was stateoftheart for its time and still works extremely well. But this signature film of the late '60s was more than screeching tires and muscle cars flying down the hills of San Francisco.McQueen was not a great actor in the sense of being able to play a variety of characters convincingly  but then most film actors are not. Bogart Grant Gable Wayne Dean Eastwood et al. each developed a distinctive screen character that audiences found appealing and then built their careers on that character. McQueen could be charming in romantic roles Love with the Proper Stranger and he had the guts and boxoffice clout to risk playing against his typical character in The Reivers and An Enemy of the People. But his basic screen persona as exemplified in Bullitt was the cool reserved physical acter who distrusted words and relied on his own body and wits to survive in a hostile world. His characters are consummate professionals whose skills and competence give their lives meaning in the chaos of war and urban crime. Audiences respond to McQueen because of that selfreliance and competence the same quality that made the young James Cagney so appealing and his healthy skepticism about convention and authority.Frank Bullitt was a particularly interesting character for McQueen because he was for the first time playing an actual authority figure a respected police detective but one still caught up in the intrigues of the establishment personified by a politically ambitious DA Chalmers Robert Vaughan. When Bullitt fails to protect the DA's mob witness and one of his own men is badly shot up the detective sets out to find out the truth of the situation and ultimately discovers that the DA has been conned. It's interesting in this preWatergate film that there's no hint of criminality or corruption about Vaughan's character or any of Bullitt's San Francisco police superiors. Bullitt's ultimate contempt for Chalmers stems both from an innate distrust of politicians who are willing to compromise standards of professionalism for political gain as well as the the DA's sheer incompetence in dealing with the Mob. The plot requires close attention I recall that it took me two or three viewings before I understood everything that was going on in the film. But Bullitt rewards repeat viewings with new wrinkles and insights. The film also benefits from the great location photography and from a superb cast of character actors. Bullitt's fellow detectives Don Gordon and Carl Reindel are likewise dedicated professionals his boss Simon Oakland is also a pro sympathetic to Bullitt but wary of the political pressures on the police department. Norman Fell is downright scary as a police captain allied with the smooth oily Chalmers and Robert Duvall stands out in a rather small role. The locations and supporting actors lend a realism to Bullitt that also make it satisfying after multiple viewings.UltimatelyBullitt is not about the car chase and shootouts but about a person trying to maintain his humanity and selfrespect while doing a violent sordid job that society demands and in which he obviously believes. At one point Bullitt's luscious girlfriend Jacqueline Bisset at her most appealing happens on a crime scene and realizes the true nature of her lover's work. You're living in a sewer Frank! she cries. And it is a very expensive place to live. Bullitt shows humane instincts and flashes of warmth and humor but his attitude toward life is one of suspicion and skepticism. He's constantly on his guard on edge seldom able to relax even with his girl. The film ends ambiguously as Bullitt quietly contemplates the emotional price he pays for his authority and for doing a soulgrinding job at which he has become quite adept. It's this deeper layer of character and emotion not the car chase that make this film a classic.".

McQueen's wife divorced in partially because he drove the Mustang in this harrowing chase through the hills of the City by the Bay. The two moments in Bullitt that overshadow the landmark chase are the instant that the bag falls from the laundry chute and smacks the hallway floor and earlier when the gunmen burst into the hotel and shoot the witness. McQueen is stylist with his closelycropped hair and his casual attire. I don't think that Hollywood could stage a finale at an airport like Yates did here. This was Peter Yates' big break after he made Robbery about the great British train robbery. Reportedly McQueen hired Yates on the basis of Robbery.

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Yates' Bullitt is arguably one of the greatest police movies ever made as well as one of the best movies of all time in general. The movie stars Steve McQueen as Lt. Frank Bullitt as a tough as nails San Francisco policeman who is asked by Walter Chalmers played by Robert Vaughn who is there to hold a hearing at a Senate subcommittee to protect a Chicago mobster named Johnny Ross played by Pat Renella who is going to turn evidence against that organization during the hearing though Chalmers is constantly asking Bullitt for Ross's safety at all costs or else Bullitt would pay the consequence for not protecting Ross. Bullitt and his 2 other police buddies Sgt. Delgetti played by Don Gordon and Det. Carl Stanton played by Carl Reindel end up putting Ross in protective custody for 2 days until the hearing meanwhile his superior officer Capt. Samuel Bennett played by Simon Oakland ends up giving Bullitt full authority of the case. The chase scene in this film reminded me of the chase scene in the French Connection 1971 but the chase scene in this movie a lot more entertaining and lasts much longer and the neatest thing about the chase scene in this film is at first Bullitt knows that he is being followed by the Hitman who supposedly killed Ross and then he starts chasing him for an 11 minute time period the difference in the chase scene in Friedkin's film is that the Gene Hackman character chases the criminal underneath a railroad track for a short period of time and the one in this film I won't repeat again. McQueen gives his best performance since both The Magnificent Seven 1960 and the Great Escape 1963 and Robert Vaughn is also perfectly cast as the extremely annoying character who constantly demands that Bullitt gives him his dead witness and also Peter Yates was a great choice to direct this film as well as Robert Duvall as the taxi driver it is a great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Far be it for me to say that not all movies have residual value.The studio exec's had a seven picture deal with McQueen's Seven Arts company and did not like that Steve stood up for his project and would not lay down. He did not want to 'fake' the city back ground on studio 'back lots' he wanted to stay true to the art not the convenience and artificiality of typical studio moviefaking techniques. The formed 'formula' that the Indies have been rebelling against for years. McQueen was a true rebel and with a method to his madness indeed. The studios executives became so 'Upset' at his 'stance' that they came back to him and cut the contract with him eliminating the remaining six unmade films. What a joke. That fact was the 'joke' was on them in fairness the movie even after decades is still one of the strongest of action movies with a storyline to follow. No 'BS' special effects. What you see took realtime work to make it happened. One of the fastest chase scenes ever filmed in a car after using the backdrop of 'Mansell' road in the San Fran area. The reason why the movie feels so good is due to being as close to real as possible. I hate as I'm sure many discriminating movie lovers do the executive prestochangeo in the movie script or budget that is usually done at the last minute of production time like what was done to Director Sidney J Furie on SUPERMAN IV The Quest for Peace 1987 where they slashed his budget to about half of the original arrangement and then said basically 'Well what are you looking at? Get going! Bring us back a blockbuster.' It's never been truerwhat they say choose your 'battles' wisely. This is how it looks when you have grit and stick to your business with strength you either get killed or you become immovable. The studio execs are not gods of the entertainment world. Although they would like to think they are just that.But indeed Steve took his 'licks' from the principals of the school of moviehardknocks and then got up again and said I'll still do it in my style. From what I read and heard about him. This is one of my alltime favorite movies. Thank you Mr. McQueen  Mr. Yates for making it Epic. There should be in the modern directorial training classes a of the way this was scripted set up lit and shot. Even after 30years plus this still rocks even new productions and will live on further than many recent and newer films. The real interesting thing for me is that just as this is one of my all time favorite's this was on the top four alltime favorites for Elvis Presley. Recommended for lovers of awesome action and good stories. This is a winner all the way.".

He did not want to 'fake' the city back ground on studio 'back lots' he wanted to stay true to the art not the convenience and artificiality of typical studio moviefaking techniques. The formed 'formula' that the Indies have been rebelling against for years. McQueen was a true rebel and with a method to his madness indeed. The studios executives became so 'Upset' at his 'stance' that they came back to him and cut the contract with him eliminating the remaining six unmade films. What a joke. That fact was the 'joke' was on them in fairness the movie even after decades is still one of the strongest of action movies with a storyline to follow. No 'BS' special effects.

	schema:reviewBody "Steve McQueen stars as Frank Bullitt a tough San Francisco police lieutenant assigned to protect a mob witness. When the witness is gunned down it is up to Bullitt to exact his own brand of justice much to the dismay of Robert Vaughn a smarmy congressman who wishes to further his political career by prosecuting organized crime. He holds Bullitt responsible for the death of his star witness and it is up to the super cop to bring the killer down while showing Vaughn that he is nothing but a gussiedup sissyboy.McQueen's performance in this alltime classic is the archetype for not only anyone who aspires to become an actor but also for the proper way to live like a real man. Think about it. He disregards such nonsense as police procedure he gets to drive a really cool car and if that's not enough Jacqueline Bisset worships the ground he walks on. As far as I'm concerned this guy's the luckiest guy on earth!As for the supporting cast you could not have asked for a better one. The great Simon Oakland is perfect as Bullitt's sympathetic captain. Fans may remember Oakland as the psychologist at the end of Psycho in what may be the most brawny portrayal of a shrink in modern cinema. Robert Vaughn exudes the right amount of smarminess and stupidity associated with politicians. Norman Fell displays why he is one of the most underrated talents of this halfcentury in his portrayal of one of Vaughn's associates. Jacqueline Bisset shows up for window dressing as Bullitt's girlfriend. Let's face it. If she were a reallife girlfriend she would probably cry and nag McQueen all day preventing him from engaging in really cool activities like speeding through the streets of San Francisco chasing after lowlife scum. And as a bonus Robert Duvall appears briefly in the greatest portrayal of a cab driver of all time. That is of course until Mr. T starred in D.C. Cab.The movie wisely dispenses with such useless elements as plot and emotion. Instead genius auteur Peter Yates allows McQueen to concentrate on looking intense and dealing with all the existential problems of any real man such as how to ignore stupid politicians and treat them as if they are irrelevant.Aside from the NECESSARY violence there is nothing in this PGrated film that any selfrespecting parent would find objectionable. In fact when my daughter can appreciate quality films aside from the Barney collection this will be the first of many requiredviewing films for her followed by The Dirty Dozen The Good the Bad and the Ugly and Dirty Harry.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have found in my life that few films hit me properly from the start. BULLITT which I first saw at College was one of them. It cemented my high opinion of the cinematic acting ability of Steve McQueen and it has always struck me as one of the best police procedural films in terms of the way the investigation is handled by McQueen's titled character. But the chase at the center of the film is the highpoint that made me love the film. And oddly enough Director Peter Yates manages to somewhat top it with the second chase through the runways of an airport at the film's conclusion.McQueen works under Simon Oakland as a detective in the San Francisco Police Department. He lives with his artistic girlfriend Jacqueline Bissett. One day he is one of the detectives assigned to protect an important witness against the mob that is supposed to be presented to the anticrime commission by millionairewouldbe politician Robert Vaughn. The witness is set up in a motel with policemen as guards. There should be no problem. Yet two mob hit men manage to crash in wound the police one fatally and kill the witness. McQueen is told of this and goes to the hospital. He has little use for Vaughn an arrogant creep if ever there was one or his stooge central police connection Norman Fell. His sole interest now is to find the killers and figure out what happened. He does so by hiding the fact that the witness died  and spreading the word that the police are now redoubling efforts to protect the witness. While Vaughn fumes and Fell threatens Oakland and McQueen the latter continues the investigation aided by cabby Robert Duvall in an early role. This leads to the chase sequence which starts with us being aware that the cab and then McQueen's car are being followed by a car with the two hit men in it. The beginning of the sequence is mild as we see them driving after McQueen but the turning point is when they have apparently lost him and he reappears following their car. Then they go into the outskirts of San Francisco and the roads from the city with the added threats of other vehicles and of a twelve gage sawed  off shotgun one of the hit men uses.There are nice procedural moments throughout McQueen seeing the set up of the now closed crime scene at the motel with ribbons tracing the trajectories of the bullets the investigation of a dead woman's trunk and belongings to figure out why she was killed a sequence with a 1968 version possibly a first of a fax machine of that period  a favorite scene of mine because it knocks the props out of both Vaughn's arrogance and Fell's belief that his own future in the police is made. And the issues of the effect of the job on McQueen is not forgotten either. Bissett witnesses the aftermath of some violence and confronts him on how he can stand it every day.I do not think any other crime and cop thriller ever hit the notes so naturally and perfectly together. The cast helps from McQueen down to the two hit men silent roles for stunt men. Witness too that Simon Oakland plays a nice character for once and does well with his part look at the scene between him and a threatening Vaughn outside the church Oakland is taking his family to on Sunday. Vaughn is great as a smarmy selfish piece of work who sees people as pawns to play with for his own benefit. McQueen finally tells him off but does it effectively and without histrionics.This is one of those films that just never ages.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film begins with perhaps the opening title sequence in film history. The look the sounds and the titles themselves....all very very cool. Lalo Schifrin's song is the perfect jazz tune to accompany this and you just know that this movie is something special.The title character Steve McQueen is a Lieutenant with the San Francisco police and he and his partner Don Gordon are assigned the task to protect a mob informant. Now considering that this is an actionsuspense film what happens next is no big surprise. However what was nice is how the film combined realistic looking police work with amazing action and grittinesslike combining Film Noir with and action film as well as a healthy dose of cool. I could say more about the plot but would rather notas there are a lot of mystery elements about the film and I'd hate to ruin the surprises and twists.The most famous part of this film is of course the great car chase scenefeaturing a Ford Mustang playing 'cat and mouse' with a Dodge Charger up and down the hills of the city. It's a magnificent scene but fortunately there's a lot more to the film than thisit's NOT just this chase but a wellmade and intelligent cop filma very gritty one at that. To make things even better the film featuring some excellent actors doing their craft in addition to McQueensuch as Robert Vaughn Simon Oakland and Don Gordonwho I have always thought was an underrated actor.If you see this film you may see some parallels with the later Dirty Harry series. Both are set in San Francisco both feature an undercover cop who hates to play by the rules and both are tough characters. However McQueen's 'Bullit' is more cool and thoughtful but a lot less intensely angryand as a result a lot easier to believe...but also a bit less entertaining as he doesn't have all those wonderful Eastwood taglines! Personally I prefer McQueen's styleyou may not.Overall the film is exceptionalone of the best police films of the era. In fact I had a hard time deciding whether or not to give it a 9 or 10and giving any film a 10 is something I very very rarely do. Why a 10? Well the film has got it allan interesting plot great action terrific tension and a realism that sets it apart from the usual cop film. And it sure has style to boot. Not surprisingly this film was very influential and was followed by many police films which were reminiscent of Bullittsuch as The French Connection McQ and of course the Dirty Harry films. The only deficits and they are very very minor is that perhaps McQueen is too cool and quiet as well as how inexplicable it is in the airport scene that none of the many many travelers seem to notice he is holding a gun. You'd think someone would notice and say something! Still it's a great film from start to finish and it holds up marvelously over time.".

The only deficits and they are very very minor is that perhaps McQueen is too cool and quiet as well as how inexplicable it is in the airport scene that none of the many many travelers seem to notice he is holding a gun. You'd think someone would notice and say something! Still it's a great film from start to finish and it holds up marvelously over time.";

	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere inside the overlong 114minute Bullitt there is a brisk 90minute long film desperate to get out. But as it is it's seriously overlong with nothing to sustain it. Many pointless scenes come and go with loads of long indulgent tracking shots gooseup the running time. I almost noddedoff a few times I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about regarding this film.The paperthin story has Detective Bullitt trying to determine how a Mob informant in Police custody managed to be killed he's not actually killed until about an hour later though. A local politician Robery Vaughn who didn't really want to do the film acts as the token bureaucrat standing in the way of getting things done. But getting WHAT done exactly? In 114 minutes almost NOTHING happens in this damn movie! Instead of mystery clues police procedure shootouts and problemsolving we're treated to scene after scene of...not much. Bullitt eats food at the hospital he goes shopping for celery and TV dinners he hangs around with his girlfriend a completely pointless character played by Jaqueline Bissett and sometimes takes a passing interest in the case. About 80minutes into this bore he is FINALLY involved in a car chase THE car chase that everyone raves about that 'tears up' the streets of San Francisco.I don't understand why this film has so much adoration or why all the fans proclaim it's 'the original and best' 'the one that started it all' or any other generic soundbite you can think of. There were cop movies before this there were car chases before this. What exactly is Bullitt credited with 'starting'? A sense of being cool calm and collected doesn't turn water into wine. Bullitt is plain repetitive agonizingly slow and almost completely without a plot. Don't consider me a philistine or someone who has been brainwashed by the overedited nature of modern films where we're guaranteed and explosion every five minutes. I appreciate films from all eras and from all backgrounds. But Bullitt is just way way overrated certainly does not deserve the high regard it's been lauded with. A real disappointment.".

Contrary to being even a typical cop film of its day many of the scenes here were shot in such a way as to convey a message to the viewer which goes beyond the plotline itself.  The is an urban filmnumerous scenes reflect the city  and the mood of 1968 by occasionally commenting on racial issues of the day the black doctor who is asked to be replaced and conspicuous shots of blacks other minorities after Ross is shot at the hotel and hippies porn shops on the corner etc. I found the airport tarmac chase scene even better than the car chase the dwarfing of the characters and deafening din by the jumbo Pan American 747s completely pulls the viewer in as if he or she is right there. There were some other great scenes which could almost stand alone such as one in a restaurant where a jazz quartet with flutenice 1960s touch is playing.  It fades into the next scene in which Steve McQueen is laying in bed the next morning reminiscing about the mood in that restaurant. Many people complain about the slowness of the film and it is slow and the use of such pointless scenes as the one in the restaurant but I find this is one of the things that makes it so great.  It conveys the complexity and mundaneness of everyday life.  This is a refreshing contrast to hollywood films which are always actionpacked and onedimensional. This film is a pleasure to watch. You come away from it feeling like you have experienced many things and you're not sure what all they are.".

Senator Walter Chalmers is holding a special Senate Commission on Organized Crime in America in San Francisco and has a very important witness Johnny Ross Pat Renella coming from Chicago to testify. Chalmers Wants to make sure that Ross is protected from the mob who beside testifying against it has also stolen 2000000.00 dollars from them and they want him dead and will go to any lengths to get him. Ross is assigned a unit from the SFPD headed by Let. Frank Bullitt Steve McQueen for around the clock protection at an undisclosed hotel. Just before Ross entered the hotel he made a number of Phone calls one was to a hotel in San Mateo Calif. Later back in his hotel room with Sgt. Stanton Carl Reindel guarding him Ross slides open the lock on the door and just then two men enter the hotel room and blast both Ross and Sgt. Stanton away at the hospital Sgt. Stanton survives but Ross dies on the operating table.Let. Bullitt wisely decides to keep Ross' death secret from Senator Chalmers as well as the media by having Ross' body put on ice in the hospital morgue unidentified under a John Doe. With Ross' death kept under cover Let. Bullitt checks out Ross' phone calls before he entered the hotel room and finds that the call to the San Mateo hotel was to a woman who registered under the named of Dorothy Simmons. With the Senate Commission hearing the next day Bullitt begins to realize that this dead hood Johnny Ross may not the person that he seems to be. As Let. Bullitt gets closer to the truth about the whole Ross business his life becomes endangered by the two killers Paul Genge and Bill Hickman who killed Johnny Ross in his hotel room. This sets the scene for the thrilling and exciting car chase that the movie is noted for. Setting him up for an ambush on a deserted San Francisco street Bullitt turns the tables on the killers by backtracking and then surprises and chases them into a hot corner. We have the two killers and Let. Bullitt flooring the gas peddle and tearing up the roads and highway in and around San Francisco and the Bay Area. The exciting car chase comes to an end when after trying to shoot at Bullitt's car with a shotgun the killers auto loses control and smashes into a gas station with both of the killers ending dead and burned to a crisp .Back at the police station Bullitt starts to check out the mysterious Mrs. Simmons the woman who Ross called before he was killed at her hotel room in San Mateo and finds her murdered. Looking at Mrs. Simmons' luggage Let. Bullitt and the police find out that she was really a Mrs. Renick and was scheduled to leave San Francisco with her husband Edward on a plane trip to Italy? whats going on here? Checking Mrs.Renick aka Simmons husbands passport photo Bullitt realizes that Johnny Ross who was killed at the hotel room was really her husband Edward Renick a car dealer from Chicago with no mob connections. Renick must have been paid off by the real Johnny Ross Felice Orlandi to impersonate him with Ross taking Renick's passport and identity and checking out of the country and away from the law and the mob who were both looking for him! Ross must have also doublecrossed both Renick and his wife by having them murdered. With the real Johnny Ross now heading for the San Francisco International Airport to make his getaway Let. Frank Bullitt is the only one who has a chance to stop him and as it gets closer for Ross' flight to take off for Italy the chances of him getting caught are getting slimmer by the minute. Terrific policeactiondrama with an ending at the airport thats as good as the great car chase seen earlier in the film that left everyone gasping. Also good in the film is Jackie Bisset as Let. Frank Bullitt's girlfriend Cathy who had trouble accepting Frank's job as a policeman especially by seeing up front and personal the murdered Mrs. SimmonsRenick what that job did to him as well as what it was doing to her her by living with him.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know how this film can be criticized as dated except in the most superficial sense of the word. It stands by itself. There hasn't been another movie quite like it before or since. Essentially a straightforward tale of a policeman unraveling a gangster plot it alternates between trouve scenes that look and sound as unrehearsed as real life and spectacular moments involving chases and shootings. It's still a highly stylized film of course. Every shot change but one is a cut not a fade or dissolve. Most people speak more lines when found in Steve McQueen's circumstances or so I would think. Most men don't come home to find Jackie Bissett asleep in their beds a pity. There has probably never been a pursuit like that filmed in the hills of Colma which is known locally as the city that waits for the city that waits to die to die. I once saw a highspeed pursuit in the streets of Philadelphia and was amazed at how slowly and carefully both the police and their quarry were driving  slowing down for stop signs and all that. When the broth is reduced the plot isn't unlike many John Wayne movies. He's a loner dedicated to his job living an otherwise uneventful life in a modest apartment except for one thing Jacqueline Bissett. His other contacts are distant or perfunctory. His relationship with partner Don Gordon is defined in the first few minutes as strictly professional nothing more. He's respected but not loved until Bissett appears in his life. How did he get that way? Who knows? Who CARES really? A person's development can't be explained in a few minutes of screen time even if we knew what caused it without recourse to revelations that have always been clichs  he had zits during adolescence or they took away his sled when he was just a kid. Not even cheap shots at sympathy mongering  he lost his wife recently  are brought in. Bissett is important to the plot because she represents the possibility of his returning to the human race as a person capable of warm and deeply emotional relationships however clumsy his expressions of warmth may still be. The conflict between McQueen and Bissett involves her inability to accept the gruesome aspects of the life he leads a common device. See John Wayne and Patricia Neal in Operation Pacific or Al Pacino and Diane Venora in Heat. Bissett finally yields and accepts the conditions. Any other ending would have been pretty bleak she leaves him and he becomes even more bitter and lonely as he ages or unbelievable he resigns from the SFPD and becomes a Zen Buddhist monk. Superficially it seems that McQueen has won the contest but actually it is Bissett who comes out as the more admirable flexible capable of changing and adapting open to further development in her interests. And as far as that goes the movie ends ambiguously. Bissett has come back to him but as McQueen puts his gun aside and washes his face in the bathroom he looks up and stares in the mirror expressionless.

	onyx:emotionText "I don't know how this film can be criticized as dated except in the most superficial sense of the word. It stands by itself. There hasn't been another movie quite like it before or since. Essentially a straightforward tale of a policeman unraveling a gangster plot it alternates between trouve scenes that look and sound as unrehearsed as real life and spectacular moments involving chases and shootings. It's still a highly stylized film of course. Every shot change but one is a cut not a fade or dissolve. Most people speak more lines when found in Steve McQueen's circumstances or so I would think. Most men don't come home to find Jackie Bissett asleep in their beds a pity. There has probably never been a pursuit like that filmed in the hills of Colma which is known locally as the city that waits for the city that waits to die to die. I once saw a highspeed pursuit in the streets of Philadelphia and was amazed at how slowly and carefully both the police and their quarry were driving  slowing down for stop signs and all that. When the broth is reduced the plot isn't unlike many John Wayne movies. He's a loner dedicated to his job living an otherwise uneventful life in a modest apartment except for one thing Jacqueline Bissett. His other contacts are distant or perfunctory. His relationship with partner Don Gordon is defined in the first few minutes as strictly professional nothing more. He's respected but not loved until Bissett appears in his life. How did he get that way? Who knows? Who CARES really? A person's development can't be explained in a few minutes of screen time even if we knew what caused it without recourse to revelations that have always been clichs  he had zits during adolescence or they took away his sled when he was just a kid. Not even cheap shots at sympathy mongering  he lost his wife recently  are brought in. Bissett is important to the plot because she represents the possibility of his returning to the human race as a person capable of warm and deeply emotional relationships however clumsy his expressions of warmth may still be. The conflict between McQueen and Bissett involves her inability to accept the gruesome aspects of the life he leads a common device. See John Wayne and Patricia Neal in Operation Pacific or Al Pacino and Diane Venora in Heat. Bissett finally yields and accepts the conditions. Any other ending would have been pretty bleak she leaves him and he becomes even more bitter and lonely as he ages or unbelievable he resigns from the SFPD and becomes a Zen Buddhist monk. Superficially it seems that McQueen has won the contest but actually it is Bissett who comes out as the more admirable flexible capable of changing and adapting open to further development in her interests. And as far as that goes the movie ends ambiguously. Bissett has come back to him but as McQueen puts his gun aside and washes his face in the bathroom he looks up and stares in the mirror expressionless. If he doesn't change the relationship with Bissett is in jeopardy. She will continue to embrace life I'm glad I don't have to try defining a term like that while leaving him behind.The movie was released in 1968 probably shot in 1967 the height of HaightAshbury and the flower power movement.

	schema:reviewBody "Bite the Bullet has a lot to chew on and boasts a fine cast held firmly under control. Hackman gives his usual unobtrusive acting lesson Coburn twinkles but not too much and Bergen gives the first decent acting performance of her career after Hackman chewed her out for her lack of professional skills and she requested his help. Questions of greed competition teamwork loyalty betrayal and humanity are all given a good and nonmedicinal airing. There's enough action here for the inert and enough philosophy for the grownups.There's been discussion in these reviews of the director's use of slowmotion. Slow motion is not used here to make intellectual points it is an instrument of emotional expression. When one character in real time passes another in slow motion it conveys to us how they both feel at that moment and doesn't need to carry any other freight. As an expressive device it works.The question of animal abuse has also come up in these pages. In Bite the Bullet the horses are always photographed as heroes often visually overwhelming their riders. Gene Hackman is shown from the beginning as a fighter of cruelty against animals and every abuse he witnesses he then tries to remedy. The education of the Jan Michael Vincent character is a case in point.Furthermore this picture makes you care about the animals unlike the traditional offhand Hollywood cruelty. Dozens of horses were killed to make the last reel of the Errol Flynn Charge of the Light Brigade and the film itself couldn't care less. You can see trip wires being used wholesale as late as in Khartoum and when those horses went down they broke legs and were immediately shot not pretend for real. Hollywood's excuse has always been that horses are expensive and they don't kill them thoughtlessly. Stunts are performed by circus horses which presumably don't come to harm. We're told the only horses that get killed are old and already destined for the glue factory. Whether this justifies trip wires or not is up to you but that's what they say.Bite the Bullet comes off as sensitive and responsible by comparison. This is no snuff film. The Oscarwinning sound design makes you really care when the horses are supposed to be in distress. A lot worse things happen to the human characters in just about every actionadventure film of the last twenty years. Is the yuck factor we're now trying to get used to more or less disgusting?All in all Bite the Bullet is a worthwhile film with content humor and beauty. There's thousands of worse ways to spend your time than watching this movie.".

Hackman gives his usual unobtrusive acting lesson Coburn twinkles but not too much and Bergen gives the first decent acting performance of her career after Hackman chewed her out for her lack of professional skills and she requested his help. Questions of greed competition teamwork loyalty betrayal and humanity are all given a good and nonmedicinal airing. There's enough action here for the inert and enough philosophy for the grownups.There's been discussion in these reviews of the director's use of slowmotion. Slow motion is not used here to make intellectual points it is an instrument of emotional expression. When one character in real time passes another in slow motion it conveys to us how they both feel at that moment and doesn't need to carry any other freight. As an expressive device it works.The question of animal abuse has also come up in these pages. In Bite the Bullet the horses are always photographed as heroes often visually overwhelming their riders. Gene Hackman is shown from the beginning as a fighter of cruelty against animals and every abuse he witnesses he then tries to remedy. The education of the Jan Michael Vincent character is a case in point.Furthermore this picture makes you care about the animals unlike the traditional offhand Hollywood cruelty. Dozens of horses were killed to make the last reel of the Errol Flynn Charge of the Light Brigade and the film itself couldn't care less. You can see trip wires being used wholesale as late as in Khartoum and when those horses went down they broke legs and were immediately shot not pretend for real. Hollywood's excuse has always been that horses are expensive and they don't kill them thoughtlessly. Stunts are performed by circus horses which presumably don't come to harm. We're told the only horses that get killed are old and already destined for the glue factory. Whether this justifies trip wires or not is up to you but that's what they say.Bite the Bullet comes off as sensitive and responsible by comparison. This is no snuff film. The Oscarwinning sound design makes you really care when the horses are supposed to be in distress. A lot worse things happen to the human characters in just about every actionadventure film of the last twenty years. Is the yuck factor we're now trying to get used to more or less disgusting?All in all Bite the Bullet is a worthwhile film with content humor and beauty. There's thousands of worse ways to spend your time than watching this movie.";

Not only does it resist the '70s urge to show gore and brutality it also manages to come up with a plot that is actually quite novel. It also marks an example of the thirdtimelucky adage for Gene Hackman.... for this was his third western of the '70s and the first of real quality his previous two  The Hunting Party and Zandy's Bride  being pretty terrible if truth be known.At the turnofthecentury various riders gather in a Wild West town to compete in an endurance horse race of some 700 miles or so. Among those seeking the glory and the romance are English gentleman Norfolk Ian Bannen young showoffy hothead Carbo JanMichael Vincent a rugged old man in search of a final moment of honour Ben Johnson a poor Mexican with serious dental problems Mario Ateaga feisty female entrant Jones Candice Bergen former Rough Rider Luke Matthews James Coburn and introspective horselover Sam Clayton Gene Hackman. As they ride through forests deserts and mountains toward the finishing line the riders get involved in various adventures and tragedies. Some lose their horses along the trail others are even less fortunate and lose their lives.Bite The Bullet is a very good western with convincing performances from its allstar cast and luscious cinematography from the great Harry Stradling Jr. The opening quarter of the film is fairly slow with time given over to the character introductions and a little probing into the motivations of each rider. However this proves worthwhile later as the fate of each rider gains significant power because the audience has come to understand  to know if you like  the various characters. On the whole the period detail and the dialogue seem impeccable. Alex North's score is good and adds an extra dimension to the proceedings. The only flaw worth mentioning is that the film's structure  perhaps inevitably  is rather episodic.... every few minutes the narrative jumps to another rider and follows their adventures for a scene or two before jumping again to another character. There was probably no way to avoid this but it is occasionally tedious and frustrating for the viewer because just as they are getting into the plight of one rider the action cuts away to the plight of another. Aside from this minor flaw Bite The Bullet is a highly impressive film and easily earns a spot on the toptenwesternsofthe'70s list.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sensational Western excellently acted  marvelously photographed and well screenwritten with fine eye by Richard Brooks . It deals with some aging riders as Hackman  Coburn and Ben Johnson who get chance redeem themselves along with a young gunslinger  a Brit lord  a Mexican and an exwhore . The film was based on a real  endurance race at the turn of the century  it was inspired by the 1908  700mile crosscountry horse race from Evanston  Wyoming to Denver  Colorado. It was sponsored by the Denver Post  which offered 2500 prize money to the winner . At the beginning of the 20th century a newspaper organizes a grueling horse race  700 miles to run in a few days . A bunch of exrough riders and a gunfighter enter a horse race in the desert . The motley group of disparate adventurers are competing  among them a woman  exprostitute Candice Bergen  Miss Jones a Mexican  an Englishman Ian Bannen  a young gunslinger JanMichael Vincent  an old one Ben Johnson and two friends  Sam Clayton Gene Hackman  though Charles Bronson turned down the leading role and Luke Matthews James Coburn . All those individualists learn to respect for each other and develop a grudging and growing friendship . An overlong and dangerous horse race is the subject of this stunning and grand adventure  an epic in every sense of word . Impressive and breathtaking ending with the finalists terminating the grueling race . Exciting  funny and well acted  especially by Gene Hackman and James Coburn as two tough  twofisted riders . Special mention to Ben Johnson as a veteran rider in his last feat . Colorfully photographed in Technicolor and Panavison by Harry Stradling Jr in Valley of Fire State Park and its Coyote Pass and Deah Valley Nevada Chama New Mexico  Lake Mead Taos  Nevada White Sands National Monument Alamogordo New Mexico . Exceptional and thrilling soundtrack by Alex North Cleopatra Spartacus  now a classic score .Directed and screenplayed with magnificent style by Richard Brooks . He was a fine writerdirector so consistently mixed the good and average which it became impossible to know that to expect from him next . Firstly he worked regularly as a Hollywood screenwriter . After that  his initial experience of directing was one of his own screenplays called Crisis. The Richard Brooks films that have the greatest impact are realized during the 50s and 60s as Cat on a hot tin roof Something of value  Elmer Gantry Sweet bird of youth In cold blood  Lord Jim. Brooks was a writer and director of Chekhovian depth  who mastered the use of understatement anticlimax and implied emotion . His films enjoyed lasting appeal and tended to be more serious than the usual mainstream productions . Richards formerly directed another good Western titled The professionals  also with various tough stars as Burt Lancaster  Lee Marvin  Jack Palance and Robert Ryan  including the same musician  Alex North  and similar outdoors . The Bite the bullet is an authentic must see  not to be missed for buffs of the genre . A magnificent movie  hardly noticed for its theatrical release  however  being nowadays very well considered . Rating  Above average because of its awesome acting  dialog  score are world class.".

We have Brook's trademark crisp dialogue driving the epic about an endurance race set in the waning days of the american west. In place of Burt Lancaster and Lee Marvin professionals we have James Coburn and Gene Hackman as the soldiers of fortune thrown into the circumstance of this race. They both give superior performances. Ably supporting them in what should have gotten him a second supporting actor Oscar is Ben Johnson. If there is any quibble at all with the film it is the casting of of Candice Bergen as the prostitute turned contestant. She simply looks too well preserved to have lived the life her character has placed before the audience. One interesting note about the film had the exchange of actors functioning in basically the same part over the course of the film. Paul Stewart who is uncredited starts the film out as the wealthy rancher Parker until about a quarter of the way through the film when with an ingenious use of a looped line Dabney Coleman appears as Parker's son taking over the character's function from that point on.I remember seeing this film in it's initial engagement at Radio City Music Hall and it is still a fresh and rewarding experience. It is a shame that the upcoming DVD release will have no special features. I know Mr Coburn recorded a commentary for THE MAGNIFICENT 7 Ms. Bergen did THE SAND PEBBLES and Mr. Hackman did the FRENCH CONNECTION discs. It would have been great to hear stories from these fine actors about this shoot. At the very least it would be nice the have Alex North's Oscar nominated score isolated on the disc.".

	schema:headline " Great cast and dialog highlight this fun but not frivolous Western";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a fun Western with some great dialog that manages to be realistic about the Wild West without wallowing in severity and hardship.Bite The Bullet is about a 700 mile horse race across the harsh terrain of the West. A newspaper publisher has put up 2 thousand dollars to the winner to drum up readers for his publication attracting a colorful field of competitors. There's Sam Clayton Gene Hackman a cowboy who cares as much about horses as he does people Luke Matthews James Coburn is Sam's old friend and a gambling whoring scoundrel looking to parlay winning the race into even more money Miss Jones Candace Bergen is a former prostitute with her own reasons for entering the race Carbo JanMichael Vincent is a kid who thinks he's a man until he learns what real manhood is during the cruelest days of the race There's also a Brit just looking for a challenge a Mexican with a bad tooth hoping to win for his family an old cowhand who wants to be famous before he dies as well as a few more including the newspaper publisher's picked man on an Arabian stallion.Each day the riders are given a new map that shows the safest but not necessarily the quickest route to the next checkpoint. While there's an awful lot of riding this story isn't about race strategy. It is about the problems the riders encounter on the trail and the ones they bring with them including secret plots foolish decisions accidents bad luck and bad men.The best thing about Bite The Bullet is a lot of very fine dialog both serious and humorous. Just about every character gets at least a couple of lines you'll remember after the film is over. And though memorable the dialog almost never seems contrived or forced. These seem like real people who just managed to say the things you always wished you had said after the moment had passed.This movie also straddles the line between the artificial everything is clean and wonderful world of the Westerns of the 1950s and the overwrought everything is crap world of the modern Western like Unforgiven. The Wild West was a very rough place where life could be very hard unpleasant and short. As Westerns have tried to more accurately represent that reality a new clich has been created. Instead of the West being the land of the singing cowboy it's become a dystopic hellhole where no one in their right mind would ever want to live. Bite The Bullet threads the needle between those two extremes. It doesn't shy away from the difficulties and obstacles of living in a land where civilization is little more than a rumor but it also doesn't ignore the fact that the West was a frontier where a man and sometimes even a woman could live his own life on his own terms in his own way. The Wild West was a bit like warfare. It was terrible and glorious and sometimes both at the same time.This is something of a sprawling story and it's not as tightly assembled as a lot of contemporary filmmaking. And after a pretty anticlimactic showdown the movie turns maudlin right before it abruptly fades to black. It tries really hard to make a point about malefemale relationships but never quite makes sense. This movie also contains a lot of bad stuff being done to horses. Some of it is just movie fakery but some of it you wouldn't be allowed to do to a horse in a film today.Aside from a few uncomfortable moments when you wonder if something bad really did just happen to a horse when you've got a good script along with Gene Hackman and James Coburnit's hard for any movie to go wrong.".

The Wild West was a very rough place where life could be very hard unpleasant and short. As Westerns have tried to more accurately represent that reality a new clich has been created. Instead of the West being the land of the singing cowboy it's become a dystopic hellhole where no one in their right mind would ever want to live. Bite The Bullet threads the needle between those two extremes. It doesn't shy away from the difficulties and obstacles of living in a land where civilization is little more than a rumor but it also doesn't ignore the fact that the West was a frontier where a man and sometimes even a woman could live his own life on his own terms in his own way. The Wild West was a bit like warfare. It was terrible and glorious and sometimes both at the same time.This is something of a sprawling story and it's not as tightly assembled as a lot of contemporary filmmaking. And after a pretty anticlimactic showdown the movie turns maudlin right before it abruptly fades to black. It tries really hard to make a point about malefemale relationships but never quite makes sense. This movie also contains a lot of bad stuff being done to horses. Some of it is just movie fakery but some of it you wouldn't be allowed to do to a horse in a film today.Aside from a few uncomfortable moments when you wonder if something bad really did just happen to a horse when you've got a good script along with Gene Hackman and James Coburnit's hard for any movie to go wrong.";

So many characters stunt doubles changes of landscape and minutes strain attention. In the final plotturn the soundtrack painfully echoes comedies like The Great Race while the actors go hammy. Suddenly one sees the undisciplined indulgent undiscriminating side of the decade.

The emphasis in these films is on telling a true story with all the mundane unpleasantness left intact.  Bite the Bullet is not a feelgood film but it does offer a realistic portrayal of an endurance race by choosing an assortment of standard western types and evaluating them through the eyes of one reluctant participant.

	schema:reviewBody "You don't have to see more than a few minutes of this movie to start picking out the plot holes. What a disaster.Bergen's character for instance enters the race not to win but because she knows that the race goes right near where her husband is in prison. She wants to break him out and she wants to use the race to help her. Her plan is to do the race day after day until she runs across the chain gang that has her husband. Then she will overpower the guard and vamoose with the hubby.Stupid stupid stupid plan. But it works. She rides hundreds of miles at breakneck speed and wondrously comes upon the chain gang with her husband at the exact time she passes. She never has to deviate from the race course!! The chain gang is right in the path of the race!! There is only one guard!! She gets her husband out. Wow.Neither horses nor riders are outfitted for a marathon race. Horses are used like automobiles. As long as the rider can sit the horse can keep galloping through the desert. However get a horse near the finish line and all of a sudden it's about dead. Too bad the race didn't end 300 yards earlier when the horses were frisky.I absolutely love cowboy movies and I like every actor in this movie but this is a load of garbage.Perhaps it makes sense if you have never seen a horse or a desert or a race but this is a stinker.Horses can't be run hour after hour. Deserts are both deadly hot and freezing cold. Marathon races are not done at full speed.Geeze there was even bad acting by the snake. What the heck is that snake doing trying to snuggle up to a sleeping Vincent in the middle of a hot desert day? It was probably an amateur snake that had never been a snake before. A more professional snake would have argued with the director. Real snakes seek heat when it is cold and hide from it when it is hot. If they are out in the hot sun they are hunting and they don't hunt things larger than what they can shove down their throats whole.And finally if you are ever in the desert and you and your horse are dying of thirst you aren't a horseman if you drink before you take care of your horse.This is not a factbased story as some gullibly believe. There was a race once that went the same distance but that is the only connection.Hackman Colburn Bergen Johnson Vincent fine actors. Anything they have done is more watchable than this turkey.This movie gets one cow plop out of ten. Great actors. No plot. Bad camera work. Badly edited.".

What a disaster.Bergen's character for instance enters the race not to win but because she knows that the race goes right near where her husband is in prison. She wants to break him out and she wants to use the race to help her. Her plan is to do the race day after day until she runs across the chain gang that has her husband. Then she will overpower the guard and vamoose with the hubby.Stupid stupid stupid plan. But it works. She rides hundreds of miles at breakneck speed and wondrously comes upon the chain gang with her husband at the exact time she passes. She never has to deviate from the race course!! The chain gang is right in the path of the race!! There is only one guard!! She gets her husband out. Wow.Neither horses nor riders are outfitted for a marathon race. Horses are used like automobiles. As long as the rider can sit the horse can keep galloping through the desert. However get a horse near the finish line and all of a sudden it's about dead. Too bad the race didn't end 300 yards earlier when the horses were frisky.I absolutely love cowboy movies and I like every actor in this movie but this is a load of garbage.Perhaps it makes sense if you have never seen a horse or a desert or a race but this is a stinker.Horses can't be run hour after hour. Deserts are both deadly hot and freezing cold. Marathon races are not done at full speed.Geeze there was even bad acting by the snake. What the heck is that snake doing trying to snuggle up to a sleeping Vincent in the middle of a hot desert day? It was probably an amateur snake that had never been a snake before. A more professional snake would have argued with the director. Real snakes seek heat when it is cold and hide from it when it is hot. If they are out in the hot sun they are hunting and they don't hunt things larger than what they can shove down their throats whole.And finally if you are ever in the desert and you and your horse are dying of thirst you aren't a horseman if you drink before you take care of your horse.This is not a factbased story as some gullibly believe. There was a race once that went the same distance but that is the only connection.Hackman Colburn Bergen Johnson Vincent fine actors. Anything they have done is more watchable than this turkey.This movie gets one cow plop out of ten. Great actors. No plot. Bad camera work. Badly edited.";

The most obvious moment of misjudgment comes in the big chase scene at the end. It's totally misplaced and probably was intended for the middle of the picture then delayed to provide more screen time for the female lead. It does not lead well into the finale and now stands as one of the worst continuity lapses of all time. Worse there seems to be some sequence that got lost in order for this scene to be placed where it is. At any rate the ending is mystifying in small details but enough to leave one feeling oddly unsatisfied.Others have noted the secondrate editing throughout the film but continuity errors of this sort are the director's responsibility. One feels that the director realized that he had bit off more than he could chew and rather than put it back on the plate to chop it up into smaller more manageable pieces let it sort of drool out between his lips hoping no one would notice.And this story would have worked on a lower budget with a shorter run time made in the late 1950s. Admittedly the photography is grand and there are marvelous setpieces throughout  but they don't add up to the great Western this story could have been.".

	schema:reviewBody "Blackboard Jungle director Richard Brooks made three westerns during his prestigious fortythree year career in Hollywood. This rugged liberalminded turnofthecentury oater about an arduous 700 mile horse race through scenic but inhospitable terrain was his final sagebrusher. Brooks derived his screenplay from an actual historic event the 1908 crosscountry horse race from Evanston Wyoming to Denver Colorado that the Denver Post sponsored with a 2500 purse. Brooks does a fine job of assembling his sturdy allstar ensemble cast with Gene Hackman and James Coburn playing leathery tough old pals who fought together under Teddy Roosevelt in Cuba. You start trouble Coburn quips after their first fistfight with several rowdy cowboys and I start bleeding. Essentially this is a horsefriendly competitive sports western. The atmospheric color cinematography is majestic and some of lenser Harry Stradling's photography is imaginative especially the way he integrates regular speed shots with slow motion as one horse gallops at regular speed alongside another in slowmotion. The first threequarters of the narrative concern the race itself and the participants. The vintage steam engine train constantly chugs in and out of the story. Afterward the action alternates between the horse race and the checkpoints where the riders pause to convey relevant exposition about themselves. The last twenty minutes focuses a prison break. Had Brooks not foreshadowed this part of the narrative it would have looked like a last minute departure from the main plot. Alex North's flavorful orchestral score received an Oscar nomination as did the collective efforts of Arthur Piantadosi Les Fresholtz Richard Tyler Al Overton Jr. in creating the sound. Brooks dwells on the theme of cruelty to animals and his spokesman who advocates the humane treatment of horses is the Gene Hackman protagonist. Brooks introduces him as he rescues a colt from coyotes. The colt is chained to a broken down the TipTop Glue Factory wagon. Brooks also takes a swipe at racial intolerance in the form of the prejudice shown toward a Mexican vaquero who is ridiculed by some secondary characters. Our hero Sam Clayton is quick to come to come to the vaquero's defense with a story about his Hispanic grandfather that he bathed everyday and on whom he never found a greasy spot.The race has two rules. First no horse can carry more than 160 pounds including rider saddle and extras. Second the race coordinators have provided each horseman with a compass and a map with the safest route. They don't have to follow the safest route but they must make it to each checkpoint or they will be disqualified. Mario Arteaga elicits sympathy as a Mexican horseman with a toothache. During a barroom scene the woman serving the liquor gives the Mexican a newfangled concoction designed to kill pain heroin. Technically just as Sergio Leone broke new ground in For A Few Dollars More with a marihuana puffing bandit Brooks breaks ground with the use of heroin.Candice Bergen furnishes the female interest as Kate Jones a hardluck prostitute after the 2thousand prize money. Kate has more at stake as we later learn when Brooks takes a break during the last twenty minutes from depicting horses galloping through deserts wading streams and tangling with bears. The heroine wants to break her nogood bank robbing husband Steve Walter Scott Jr. of Cotton Comes to Harlem out of prison. After she does she realizes what a terrible mistake that she has made. Brooks ties this to the theme of bad marriages and our mustached protagonist Sam Clayton Gene Hackman of Bonnie and Clyde sums up the problem in one phrase The people some people marry. Veteran western character actor Ben Johnson turns in another meaningful performance as a supporting character suffering a bad heart condition that eventually claims his life. During his dying moments he delivers an eloquent as well as insightful soliloquy about the essence of winning. Not only does Brooks have a Mexican character but he also has a cultivated Englishman Sir Harry Norfolk Ian Bannen of Too Late The Hero who has crossed the Atlantic to compete in the race. Incredibly enough JanMichael Vincent has the plum role as Carbo an obnoxious immature adult who likes to display his prowess with fists and sixguns. Actually Carbo turns out to be no cowboy after all and the revelation that everything that he has done to perpetuate this masquerade that he is a cowboy lends more depth and substance to his character than even the standardissue heroes that Hackman and Coburn portray. Kate informs Carbo late in the last halfhour that she never believed that he was a cowboy. She explains that a cowboy undresses from the boots up and only removes his headgear after he has stripped off everything. Unable to resist a joke Brooks shows Hackman and Coburn's characters eavesdropping on her speech and noticing that they still have their hats on after they have shed virtually every stitch of apparel.Naturally the dialogue is as quotable as it is philosophical as Brooks ponders the meaning of being an American. Everything boils down to winning and the recognition that comes with winning. The Hackman hero worries that he is unAmerican because he has no interest about who won a champion boxing match. Brooks cannot resist debunking the Old West and the Hackman hero becomes his mouthpiece. Former Roosevelt rough rider Sam Clayton reminiscences in one scene with Kate about the lies told about the San Juan Hill charge. Later the Dabney Coleman character complains that most of what is said about the west is a lie. Nevertheless this memorable dialogue doesn't surpass Brooks' second western the elegiac oater The Professionals. The Professionals ranks as a far better film more robust and exciting. Indeed aside from MichaelVincent's character that changes near the end of the action the only surprise in Bite the Bullet is the ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Don't you know Sam Clayton? Defender of dumb animals damsels in distress. Champion of lost causes.'Potentially this project held out the promise of writerdirector Richard Brooks adding to the list of critical successes from earlier in his career. This was especially the case as his last venture into the western the 'Professionals' nine years earlier was acclaimed as having revitalised the genre earning him Academy Award nominations as both director and writer. Yet the main flaw of this feature is in the weak structure of the overall narrative  an area in which Brooks would normally excel. This is surprising given the rich vein of material he was exploring. Based on the reallife 700 mile endurance race organised by the 'Denver Post' newspaper in 1908 the storyline held out great promise but suffers in various respects. The first of these concerns a common pitfall of ensemble casts in that by attempting to flesh out each character in turn the risk is run that none is fleshed out sufficiently. This is even true of Gene Hackman's central protagonist former 'Rough Rider' and animal lover Sam Clayton. The second allied weakness of this feature comprises the lack of logical character arcs. As such some protagonists undergo completely inexplicable emotional or psychological changes. An illustration of this is how the young headstrong wannabe played capably by JanMichael Vincent in one of his rare better performances suddenly becomes a willing gofer for Clayton and his friends. Yet this is nothing compared to the transformation undertaken by Hackman's lead character. The opening scenes clearly establish how Clayton abhors unnecessary suffering to animals. Moreover despite being hired to ensure the champion steed backed by the newspaper tycoons reaches the starting line he questions the integrity of a race where a winning horse endures far more physical hardship but the rider takes all the glory. Therefore his decision to not just take part but to drive his own horse to the point of being dead on its feet  an act for which he had earlier handed out a brutal thrashing to Vincent's character  defies any logic. A third flaw with the plot is the clumsy incorporation of the subplot centred on Candice Bergen's character's hidden motive for participating in the race. Not only does this lead to an incongruous almost comical motorbike versus equine chase but her culpability in events nearly costing the life of a fellow participant is treated with complete disinterest. Finally the race itself appears disjointed with the finale tacked on without any real buildup of tension. In terms of the acting Hackman gives a creditable performance with what little he is given in a genre which would not serve him well till his collaboration with Eastwood in the early nineties. In addition both James Coburn as Clayton's gambling former Rough Rider companion and Ian Bannon as the competing English aristocrat ably support though their characters remain onedimensional. Yet stealing the show in a supporting role which should have earned an Academy Award nomination is Ben Johnson as the anonymous 'Mister' a veteran 'Jackofalltrades' seeking to make a name for himself before he dies. If the poor continuity of the film reflects badly on the writerdirector Brooks does show glimpses of his talent with some wellcrafted dialogue. Perhaps best of these centres on Clayton's honest account of serving in the Rough Riders in Cuba alongside Teddy Roosevelt 'We didn't charge up there...We crawled up there on our scared bellies.' Another saving grace for the feature is the splendid cinematography of Harry Stradling Jr which so brilliantly captures the majestic landscape of New Mexico. By contrast the upbeat soundtrack by Alex North is out of harmony with the general tenor of the film and way too standard fare for a Western to be singled out for an Oscar nomination as it was. Overall a muddled project which even when experimenting. such as with the use of 'slowmo' lacks any cohesive rationale or plot.".

Although it seems a bit dated and many films have copied elements of its style it still captures and stirs the emotions about the possibility of falling in love and the reality of being a walking wounded mid 30's single person.   The bonus footage showing how the film was made on the cheap with minimum  rehearsing is quite amazing.  Films today are often made for hundreds to thousands times the cost and are as spontaneous as a log pile.  I recommend a revisit to this film but imagine today's young film watchers could be bored with the absence of violence swearing kinky sex and other predictable ingredients of today's formula films.  one amusing feature which dates the film is the near chain smoking both stars in the film keep doing on screen.

I recently watched Lumire and Company' which celebrates the 100th Anniversary of the movie industry.  Forty directors from around the world produced 52second films using the Lumire camera.  The fiftytwo second time limit and other constraints follow the construct of the first Lumire movie.  Of the 40 films the byfarandaway best is the one of two lovers kissing.  The man and woman are on a rotating stage so we get a 360degree view of their kiss.  In the background we see photographers each with progressively more modern cameras.  The love or passion of the man and the woman don't change only the way we are able to view them now and then.So what does this have to do with Claude Lelouch's 1996 movie A Man and A Woman'?  Well he's the director that made the above mentioned film and it reminded me that it has been years since I last watched A Man and A Woman.' I rented and watched it again.JeanLouis Duroc Trintignant and Anne Gauthier Aime are a man and woman.  They meet incidentally at the boarding school where they visit their children each weekend.  He visits his son she her daughter.  She misses her train and he offers her ride back to ride back to Paris in his car. Slowly and cautiously we learn about them as they learn about one another.  We learn about their jobs their former spouses and other details of their lives that have the movie viewer hoping this man and woman can become a couple.Lelouch's technique in telling the story is wonderful.  The film switches from black and white to color.  The switch usually comes on the change from persontoperson conversation to personal thoughts or a recounting of the past.  It's like Lelouch is using this change as quotation marks or thought balloons on the screen.  We seehear JeanLouis' and Anne's thoughts as they question their feelings about beginning a new personnel relationship.  I first saw this movie as a college student in 1966.  I really liked it then. I wondered if I'd liked it now. The movie hasn't changed but I can assure you I have.  A Man and A Woman' proves that a good story well told can be appreciated now and then.  I highly recommend that you rent and watch A Man and A Woman.'".

Very unique and subtle script by Lelouch and Uytterhoeven was worth an Oscar. This movie also deservedly won Cannes Golden Palm and Foreign Language Oscar. Music score was however neglected by Academy but remains memorable today after 40 years and is often used in similar wouldbe movies. It also inspired a sequel  A Man and a Woman 20 Years Later  in 1986. also directed by Lelouch. However it was a major disappointment with lack of any real sense and various unnecessary subplots. Except of stunning opening car race sequence. I would recommend a sequel only because of this.".

The plot is quite simple but the merit again is here the way to make it coherent. Another interesting characteristic was the successful use of nice soundtrack in several scenes. Similarly the story of each were said with several mute scenes. According to Lelouch the film gained its intensity because of its fast way of realization.

And I was not even born yet when this was made so I believe that if one tries this movie can be relevant to many generations.At its heart it's a love story. But not just any love story. The two leads are falling in love with each other madly yet cautiously but the two leads also have other loves. They each are still in love with their deceased spouses who died too suddenly and at such young ages. Each lead is also in love with their children around whom they build their worlds and act as both mother and fatherthey are both single parents. The way the grieving process is treated in this movie is realistic and heartwarming. And both children are adorable their scenes being natural and just plain cute. The children are interesting elements in the movie. They are both links to the past links to the deceased spouses and also the reason the two leads met.I have never seen more beautiful scenes than when JeanLouis is driving his Mustang on the beach Deauville I think when they are hanging out at the shore watching an old man and his dog and when they go on a date and take the kids. The date with the kids is such a real scene the dialogue being both meaningless and meaningful as it's the WAY they speak to each other that is the interesting thing in that scene. That is why a lot of it is silentit is beautiful how JeanLouis grips Anne's chair as if he cannot be close enough to her. Also when Anne remembers life with her husbandin Brazil with him singing a Samba and them riding horsesyes it may be a bit overly romantic for some people but it is beautiful nonetheless.I also have to say that the theme music is very pretty classic and has stood the test of time. Such a simple tune and it goes well with the simple beauty of this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Man and a Woman is about the simplest and least pretentious romantic story you are bound to find. This statement is important because most often the problem with the romantic comedy or the straight romance is that the story is often too contrived farfetched andor lacking in true human emotion. In this film we see how two people fall in love and better yet we don't even get a happily ever after type of ending but rather we see that these two people are willing to love again after having lost their first spouses. This film is also interesting in the way director Claude Lelouch structures his narrative. Not only do we never overdeal with the fact that they both lost their first loves we also find this information out at different times in the story and the information in the film is also communicated very visually which is interesting as opposed to hearing dialogue which if poorly delivered would come across as hamhanded. The psychological focus of the tale is definitely Anne Gauthier Anouk Aime. She is more the focus because we see both her falling in love with her first husband Pierre while Samba da Bno' by Toquinho and Vinicius was played. On a side note the addition of Samba to a French film shows how much broader their cultural horizons are than ours are. It matter not that they might not understand Portuguese for they recognize the Samba as probably the most wonderful sound ever created. We see Anne meeting her first husband and also how he dies. Then as she consummates her relationship with JeanLuc we see her thought process as she flashes back to her time with Pierre and how difficult loving another man is for her. One of the best parts of the film on Lelouch's part was when Valrie Valrie Lagrange JeanLuc's first wife is in the hospital after his accident. We see not only her strife but the passage of time through a series of jump cuts. I found this technique much more effective than a series of dissolves or on very long take. In this sequence we also see how sometimes telling can be more effective than showing as we do not see her commit suicide but rather hear JeanLuc say it with sadness in his voice. Another interesting technique in this film was alerting between color and black and white. In the very beginning of the film it was used solely to differentiate between a flashback and the present tense but rather in a reversed way. The flashbacks were in color. This presents the present as more gritty and not as joyful whereas the flashbacks may not have been happier they certainly were more colorful as they are with most people. What's impressive about 'A Man and a Woman' as is often the case with a lot of French films is it's simplicity. We deal with real people in a real type of story plot devices and formulas are completely thrown out the window. And in this film what we get is a much more enjoyable experience than any Hollywood formula could possibly provide.".

Well I suppose it will be now a matter of my personal reaction to the film.I like the film for it offered a genre different from the typical mainstream Hollywood plots. It appeals to me because it served a dish not so commonly served nowadays. I speak French Spanish German Italian and have seen many European films which really tend to be a slice of life type of a plot. I would understand that for most of us who may have been spoiled in terms of cinema indulgence making it worth our money slice of life films can become boring to watch. The use of mixed color and black and white film had served its purpose. Being a photographer myself I felt the emotions Lelouch wanted to convey portraying scenes reduced to their monochromatic elements. Black and white indeed makes the scenes more poignant and dramatic. I believe it was the black and white portions of the movie which generated the strongest sentiments in me as I was going through the film.The race scenes that I enjoyed as a male specie typically fascinated with machines especially cars. However I remember that during the sixties a number of films like that of Elvis Presley would usually incorporate race scenes. Perhaps Lelouch was riding on with the trends of filmmaking of that era. The psychological profile of the characters is very realistic especially the way their attraction for each other developed as they got to know each other more in a casual waylike in their case spending time together in the car going to and returning from the boarding school of their children. Ainouk Aimee is certainly beautiful but her physical beauty is underplayed here. In typical Hollywood fashion physical appearance tend to be given much premium before falling in love. In this case it was sort of a given and emphasis is more on getting to know a person more as a better fertile ground in making true love grow. After all as widow and widower they would have outgrown significantly the adolescent romancing of love or shall I say mating instinct? Overall I would like to affirm the awards this film has garnered. Great work Monsieur Lelouch!".

	schema:reviewBody "At first I wasn't going to comment especially after having read what the majority of others have already expressed on this unique wonderful masterpiece from the mid 1960's. Although the comments are worded differently we all seem to agree that it is a great piece of cinema. The English translation of Un homme et une femme is A man and a Woman O.K I have a fetish for 1960's memorabilia ranging from the music films cars fashion the elegance of the era and just about anything that springs to mind. Therefore I will always see beyond just a love story here as I am not really blown away by love stories anyway. If I wasn't already familiar with the main theme soundtrack having recalled hearing it on radio as a very young boy and the older model cars it would be almost impossible to guess that it was actually filmed in 1966. The clarity of this picture is near perfect. The music behind this movie is also superlative and compliments the excellent cinematography impeccably. I am certain that without this soundtrack the film would not be as impacting which I have not noticed from other comments. If I wanted to make this movie myself I would have also added the Stan Getz  Astrid Gilberto tune The girl from Ipanema as it would have fitted perfectly in this movie especially with the scene at the beach. Needless to say this film is timeless.The blend of BW with the colour filming really adds the finishing touches. This movie is also very elegant stylish romantic and above all realistic as it does not end like most other mainstream romance movies. However it leaves plenty of room for hope. With this film the viewer may seem to feel as though it is going nowhere but it uniquely captures your attention as you seem to sense as if you are acting a part in this film yourself. It does have a very welcoming affect and we can all somehow relate to it in one way or another. Perhaps it is the reality of how it unfolds which is more real life than fiction.The rally cars the snow scenes from the city of Paris the beautiful orangered sky at the beach the cafs romance and the serenity of a healthy family union is my definition of happiness".

Being young I could identify with a love story but I had not and knew no friends who had lost their loves to death. Forty years later I have children of my own know personally about the grieving process and have watched this film with fresh eyes. It has improved with time. The love story is still fresh but so much more honest than what we usually get from Hollywood.Excited and in love the couple takes a room but they or she and he able to recognize it are not ready for that step. They part she for the train he to drive back to Paris. As they travel they think about what has happened. A decision is made and the movie concludes on just the right note.The camera seems to love both Anouk Aimee and Jean Louis Trintingant it holds on them. He places his hand on her knee the camera goes to her face and lingers we watch her think we know what she will say she says it and we are rewarded for being smart for having a heart for knowing something of the process of love.Perhaps that is what the movie did for me those many years ago for I have always regarded it as one of the great love stories certainly more so than the movie of the same name for this movie teaches us how to love.It treats the roll of children in courtship tenderly as well. The children get to be themselves and the adults get a chance to decide if those children can be a part of their lives. It is sweet and hard to recognize how young LeLouch was 28when this was made according to him in sheer desperation.".

This may have been an early example of product placement since the Ford Motor Company got some advertising here.On occasion a scene is inserted that appears to have no relevance but then it turns out to be a scene from a movie that Anne is working on. I think the primary goal of those scenes and the auto racing scenes are to provide some variety and excitement to prop up an otherwise weak plot line. The screen time devoted to Trintignant's profession totally eclipses that for Anne's and I found that that unbalanced the story.This slight film is overly calculated to please.

	schema:reviewBody "My Father's Glory and its sequel My Mother's Castle tell the story of a young boy's wonder years growing up in a family with an adored father a lovely but frail mother and assorted eccentric relatives and friends. These are incredibly charming films that feature none of the violent action and highly charged emotions that we've come to expect in popular films today. Instead they celebrate the simple joys of life in a warm and loving family. When minor but unexpected events occasionally disrupt the daytoday flow of events they can seem like terrible disasters. On the other hand a simple visit to the country can seem like a tremendous adventure. It's not necessary to have seen My Father's Glory to enjoy My Mother's Castle. In fact I happened to see them out of order and I loved them just the same. But if I had my preference I'd watch them in order. The final scene of My Mother's Castle is emotionally powerful and satisfying for me it confirmed that every minute I'd invested in these films was worthwhile. I wanted to get up there on the screen and help. In French with English subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed this film tremendously. There were no grand special effects dazzling action or exciting twistsjust unbelievably beautiful filmmaking! This is a biographical tale based on the childhood of the great French directorwriter Marcel Pagnol. In fact it is because of my love of his films that I sought out this videotape and the prequel My Father's Glory. If you have not seen the Fanny trilogy or the single film by the same title starring Leslie Caron The Baker's Wife Harvest Manon of the Spring or any of his other films try to see them!! What makes all these films so wonderful is the superb writing and how his characters come to life. They are charming full of foibles and yet quite lovable! And this is definitely true in this movie as well.This movie picks up right where the prequel stoppedcomplete with the same actors. This was possible as the films were filmed together and came out the same year.Of the two films My Mother's Castle is definitely the bestthough they are both extraordinary films. What I liked about this film was that it was able to evoke so much emotion within me. For example near the end I found myself laughing loudly at the scene involving the VERY nasty guard as he gets his comeuppance! Then only minutes later I was sobbing at the profound sadness about Pagnol's later life after the main story is over there is a gutwrenching epilogue. It's profoundly sad but since it is based on real life so necessary.Watch this film with your entire familyeven the cynical members of the family are sure to enjoy!".

The French countryside pictured here is beautiful as we watch a family make trips through various gates en route to their destination. Some of it actually gets suspenseful.

	schema:reviewBody "O for one of those hours of gladness. Gone alas with our youth too soonMy Mother's Castle picks up where My Father's Glory left off tracing young Marcel's life over the next year as his enchanting remembrances of things past comes full circle. If you were nostalgic for the south of France after seeing My Father's Glory you do not have to wait long to once again smell the sprigs of wild thyme. After resuming their life again in Marseilles the family Joseph Philippe Caubere Augustine Nathalie Roussel Marcel Julien Ciamaca brother Paul Victorien Delamare and baby sister decide to return to Provence for Christmas and then again at Easter.Marcel is reunited with his friend Lili but soon discovers the charms of women in the person of Isabelle Julie Timmerman a somewhat snooty young lady who takes on the affectation of nobility to impress and dominate Marcel. Their relationship shows promise but comes to an abrupt end early in the film when Isabelle's family suddenly leaves. Soon Augustine has the idea of returning to their country home each weekend. This however presents a small problem. Aside from the fact that Joseph with the aid of Augustine's charms must rearrange his teaching schedule the family must walk five miles from the trolley station to their country home using up much of their weekend time.This problem is solved when Joseph meets Bouzique Philippe Uchan one of his former pupils. Bouzique is a canal guard who shows them how to cut eight hours from their weekly walk by illegally cutting over other people's property that runs along the canal. At first Joseph is reluctant but finally agrees. This takes on an air of great adventure and humor as Bouzique gives a key to Joseph who must unlock the doors on each estate that stand in his way. The walk becomes the focus of the film as everyone in the group must carefully avoid drawing attention to themselves. One house in particular owned by a grouchy caretaker and a surly dog named Masher causes Augustine to be quite fearful. Like My Father's Glory My Mother's Castle consists of charming vignettes that evoke a simpler time. The film works its way into our heart because the characters care about each other and we care about them. Like all idealized reflections of the past however it ultimately gives way to bittersweet reality reminding us very gently how soon youth passes but as poet Shelley put it Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.From Kerry Dances by James Lynam Molloy".

	schema:reviewBody "Yves Robert offers a second delightful story of Marcel Pagnol's innocent youth of the early 1900s in the sunny rocky landscape of Aubagne in Provence.After My Father's Glory an equally charming tale of the halcyon days of the author's childhood My Mother's Castle concludes the tale with the author's entrance into adolescence and his triumphant return to Marseilles as a successful adult.Not wishing to wait through the long term at school Marcel's mother declares her affinity for the countryside of Provence and the family begins making weekend visits much to the delight of young Marcel.Pagnol revisits his beautiful hills in Aubagne just outside Marseilles rekindling his friendship with the local boy Lili and meeting what he considers to be the young woman of his dreams only to reaffirm that youth is best spent frolicking with his chum. Marcel's charming and loving mother his wise and benevolent father his impish brother and his gregarious Oncle Jules return in their wonderful roles.The film is reminiscent of the masterpiece of Cinema Paradiso where a tale is told through the eyes of a film producer who fell in love with life while watching films in his small Italian village.My Mother's Castle coupled with My Father's Glory make for four hours of triumphant genuine cinema. Don't miss them.".

	onyx:emotionText "Yves Robert offers a second delightful story of Marcel Pagnol's innocent youth of the early 1900s in the sunny rocky landscape of Aubagne in Provence.After My Father's Glory an equally charming tale of the halcyon days of the author's childhood My Mother's Castle concludes the tale with the author's entrance into adolescence and his triumphant return to Marseilles as a successful adult.Not wishing to wait through the long term at school Marcel's mother declares her affinity for the countryside of Provence and the family begins making weekend visits much to the delight of young Marcel.Pagnol revisits his beautiful hills in Aubagne just outside Marseilles rekindling his friendship with the local boy Lili and meeting what he considers to be the young woman of his dreams only to reaffirm that youth is best spent frolicking with his chum. Marcel's charming and loving mother his wise and benevolent father his impish brother and his gregarious Oncle Jules return in their wonderful roles.The film is reminiscent of the masterpiece of Cinema Paradiso where a tale is told through the eyes of a film producer who fell in love with life while watching films in his small Italian village.My Mother's Castle coupled with My Father's Glory make for four hours of triumphant genuine cinema. Don't miss them.";

Not being able to understand all or any of the words makes you concentrate more on the characters. Their subtext actions and vocal inflections really add to the film if you just concentrate on them. The French countryside is beautifulI wish I could be there.  Oh well I guess I'll just have to be content with this movie. The only problem I have with this film is the lack of real plot.  It's basically just a chronology of events in Marcel's life.  Mais c'est la vie! Rating Four out of Five stars".

	schema:headline " A perfect continuation to one of cinema's most endearing Family sagas ...";
	schema:reviewBody "My Mother's Castle is the second opus of Marcel Pagnol's autobiographical memories adapted by Yves Robert in 1990 following the glorious My Father's Glory. Both are parts of the same story split in two maybe to let time to meditate on the enchantment induced by the first.Indeed My Father's Glory was an exploration of childhood with a mixture of tenderness nostalgia and idealization of the people who inhabited these memories especially the parents Joseph the literate schoolteacher capable to absorb every single piece of knowledge and inculcate them to his son and Augustine the most caring and loving of all the mothers.The first film was focused on the relationships between Marcel and his father reaching an emotional climax with the immense pride felt after a memorable hunting trip. But all through the film there were glimpses of Augustine's oedipal deification. She more than any other character was treated with a particular grace and delicacy people could shout argue or laugh she was the quiet strength the emotional pillar of the family standing on the symbolic pedestal of her indescribable angelic beauty.My Mother's Castle explores the maternal bond with more depth.The film features the same episodes in the countryside where the Family goes every holiday to the same house. One of its delights is to make us revisit a location that became familiar to us as if it was part of our own memories. When the film starts like Marcel we yearn for this magical Provence and hope the film won't take place in the city. Our hearts long for that escapism and thankfully they do escape.And they get back to the green hills the grasshoppers to Lili Edmond and the wonderful gallery of colorful characters ... and we're glad to see them as if they were old friends. The countryside is the perfect backdrop for Pagnol's memories and probably the only element deserving its idealization. For Marcel the bond with the countryside is almost parental as it awakened his most endearing memories. But initial emotions put apart My Mother's Castle was likely to create a djvu feeling without bringing much newness to the story.And as glad as I was to be back to the countryside and see these faces again I had mixed feelings regarding the beginning which didn't add much since the first film and even lost itself in the episode involving Isabelle an aristocratic girl infatuated on Marcel oddly treating him like a vassal. This chapter of Marcel's life was so weird although significant I was hoping it wouldn't occupy the whole story even Jean Rochefort's performance as the eccentric father left me perplexed and I felt the film had to be more than a series of anecdotes. But then the story picks up and the magic reappears when the Pagnols start going every weekend to the house.They meet in their road a guard who was one of Joseph's former pupils he benevolently proposes them to use a shortcut along the canal instead of their usual path that cost them four hours of walking through a winding road. Joseph reluctantly accepts the spare key to open several locked gate doors along the canal and across private lands. It became a habit Joseph learned to use the boys as scout observers and as the story progresses we follow them walking along the estates bending over our hearts pounding that they wouldn't meet a bitter caretaker with his ferocious dog.Across their path they meet an old and affable aristocrat who don't mind their trespassing and even offers bright red roses to Augustine. He instantly creates the picture of Augustine as rooted in Marcel's memory a beautiful and frail women holding red roses and out of fear of dogs gets nervous when they come to the last door. They finally find the door padlocked and as we expect the encounter with the guard happens and provides one of the film's most critical moments where for once one person not even touched by the sort of divine grace embracing the story and threaten Joseph to prosecution causing Augustine to faint succumbing to her eternal fear.Of course all ends well that ends well but it's not much in the resolution of this subplot than the real conclusion that the film's emotion finally implode. After a happy celebration the film takes a surprisingly dark turn enlightening us on what became of these people who made Marcel's childhood. It starts with two hands holding each other following a black car Marcel and Paul mourn their mother prematurely dead Lili died in the First World War Paul became a goatherd affected by the countryside as Marcel was and left the world in the thirties. For the first time the film conveys sad emotions as a way to cancel off the happiness and fairytale like aspect of the earlier memories. And we understand it's precisely because of these sad memories that Marcel Pagnol looked at the years preceding them with happier eyes.Lately he'd become the successful filmmaker we know and after turning a large house in Marseilles into a film studio he finds the infamous door and by breaking it he breaks the spell that caused so much torments in Augustine's heart. Like the image of Marcel holding the partridges to the sky illustrating his father's moment of glory the mother's castle awakened the image of Augustine holding the red roses on her this is the angelic and fragile image that would forever symbolize Augustine the queen of in Pagnol's castle of memories..More than anything the power of the two films is to translate universal feelings into powerful imagery this is what childhood is all about images rooted in our hearts this is what Cinema as an artform is all about and this is why My Father's Glory and My Mother's Castle are one of the summits reached by French cinema higher than these immortal hills of Provence.".

	schema:headline " Dissection of turn of the century French childhood hits the mark and proves superior to Part 1";
	schema:reviewBody "My Mother's Castle also known in French as Le Chteau de ma mre is the sequel to a twopart series of films based on famed playwright novelist and filmmaker Marcel Pagnol's childhood memoirs set in turn of the century France. My Mother's Castle is a continuation of the story of Marcel Pagnol's protagonist a young boy who grows up under the tutelage of his father Joseph a public school teacher in Marseilles. Unlike the first film My Father's Glory the sequel focuses more on Marcel instead of the uninspiring conflict between father Joseph and Uncle Jules one a confirmed atheist and the other a devoted Catholic. Of the two films I found My Mother's Castle superior to My Father's Glory not only because it moves at a brisker pace but there are more interesting things happening to Marcel and his family instead of the longwinded tale involving hunting.We find out first that the family's trip to the country home outside Marseilles takes place mostly on foot. This becomes an important piece of information later on which will be discussed in a moment. Marcel soon becomes smitten with an eccentric young girl Isabelle who orders him to dress up in different outfits. Isabelle's parents are as eccentric as she is and soon the children's relationship ends when Joseph decries that Marcel isn't allowed to see them again. Interestingly enough the family is forced to give up their expensive digs after the father a newspaper columnist insults his boss and is presumably let go.The encounter with Bouzigue Joseph's former pupil leads to some even more interesting complications. Bouzigue is a canal worker who offers a key to Joseph that opens various doors along the path next to the canal this allows the family to take a shortcut and save them hours of traveling to the country home. The only problem is that while taking the shortcut the family ends up trespassing on the private property of various noblemen who own houses along the waterway. At first Joseph refuses to even consider the idea but wife Augustine persuades him to take the shortcut as it enables the family to make the trip to the country house every week.Joseph ends up rationalizing his decision to accept Bouzigue's offer but deep down knows he's going up against his moral code. It's a fascinating quandary Joseph finds himself in and I'm sure Joseph's decision will remind most of us that we've occasionally been guilty of an ethical lapse or two in our lives. The family's encounter with the first property owner ends up quite benign as the man turns out to be a thoroughly gracious and helpful fellow. A groundskeeper on another estate allows the family to pass through unimpeded. On the family's second trip things go completely awry as they find the last door padlocked and a surly caretaker at the last estate threatens to write an official report that could lead to Joseph being fired and losing his pension. Unlike the first film there's a real dark moment here and it's nicely resolved in the third act when Bouzique and his coworkers get the caretaker to tear up his report by threatening him with violating the canal company's rules about padlocking their doors. The story also takes us back to Marseilles where Marcel must pass a big exam to obtain a scholarship at the most prestigious school in the country. Marcel's Mom has a little more to do here than in the first film where she plays the part of a stay at home Mom.My Mother's Castle ends on a sad note. We learn that Augustine dies five years later and leaves Joseph bereft. Marcel's childhood friend from the countryside Lili dies in World War I and brother Paul not long afterward at the young age of 31. Marcel eventually becomes a film director and while checking out an old house his company has bought for a film studio he discovers it's the very same house where his family met the unpleasant caretaker and almost ended Joseph's career.My Mother's Castle is a wistful remembrance of the childhood of author Pagnol. If we think back I'm sure there are a few extraordinary tales we can recall about our childhood. The narrative is put together in such a way that it reminds us of how impressionable we can be as children and that the events of those times leave a lasting impression that can never be forgotten even when one reaches the last days of old age.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brothers Hing Dai is your typical Hong Kong gangster movie and it doesn't fail to deliver. At the beginning a fortune teller tells the Tam family mob boss that his two sons will fight against each other in the future so he sends one of them to the US to separate them. Inevitably they end up getting together again and the story unfolds. While the story isn't exactly groundbreaking the cast does a stellar job playing their roles. Lead actor Kiu Wai Miu is cold resilient and mysterious as the older brother who takes care of the family business while Eason is the innocent clean younger brother. Eason does a decent job but his role doesn't really require anything out of the ordinary. Kiu Wai Miu pretty much holds the movie together with his unpredictability. You have no idea if he's good or bad if he still has a hidden hint of decency or just ruthless. Mainland actress Li Huang is the female lead although her role is fairly small I was a bit disappointed in her to be honest. She must have some connections within the entertainment circle because she gets an awful lot of roles yet each time she's really nothing more than a decently pretty face. In most of her scenes she gives me the impression of a deer caught in headlights. In Mainland China she started out with smaller roles such as the helper or assistant of the female leads and I think that's what she does best.The real show stealer here is Andy Lau also one of the producers of the movie. He plays an arrogant cop blatantly over the top with his attitude but there is only a very small handful of actors who can pull it off and look legit. Andy is definitely one of them. And my goodness the guy is in fantastic shape! In his first scene he makes instant impact with his coolness and suave exterior. I don't know if he got a facelift some antiaging treatment or just a healthy diet he is in great shape and looks much younger than before. He is so cocky that even his coworkers are played fooled on a constant basis yet he doesn't become annoying. Rather I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions and shaking my head at how arrogant this guy is. He certainly adds spice to the movie and keeps things interesting.Brothers while not an incredible film is still a decent rental at the least. The reason I give it 7 rather than 5 or 6 is because it's very well paced and the solid acting from Kiu Wai Miu and pure entertainment from Andy Lau kept me on the edge of my seat at all times. There are very few dull moments and the final scenes of the movie were tense enough as well. A good gangster flick to end the year on.".

	schema:headline " HK Neo Reviews Brothers";
	schema:reviewBody "Tagline A disappointingly average genre flick  Andy Lau  CYMA Review by Neo Andy Lau in 2007 has officially become a product placement in marketing terminology and a supporting actor in the HK film industry. Look no further than his ever existing presence in nearly every single MTR stations in HK and Kowloon his every movement with that CYMA watch is noted as the busy and quickpaced HK work force steam pass without noticing every morning. In fact it have become a piece of clich that everyone have already gotten used to and making only former HK residents like Neo noticing it as he was holidaying in the small island during 200708 Xmas. When a reviewer begins a review talking about marketing and product placement it usually comes with caution that the movie isn't any good. While the good news is that Brothers isn't outright bad since it is average on the bad side there isn't really that much to talk about. Perhaps the only piece realism that director Derek Chiu is able to inflict is quite frankly Andy Lau and his CYMA watch as both are probably the most memorable and real moment in the film. Without being a condemning critic but to be honest Neo is finding it extremely difficult to forget the moment that Andy Lau took his CYMA watch off and pretends to give it to Gordon Lam. Perhaps it assists the current reviewer to bring back memories of the HK visit but really Brothers is not a film about Andy Lau or his anonymous watch rather yet another triad story.Back in 1991 there was The Tigers and there were 5 of them and moving on some 17 years later only two and a half have gone on to better things. The first two is pretty damn obvious as we need to look no further than mentioning the name of Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu Wai and the half is notably a resurrected TVB career in Miu KiuWai.

Such is life as an Australian icon used to say Ned Kelly is an outlaw if you didn't realise it just goes to show how much effort and luck people like Lau and Leung and Miu KiuWai to an extent require staying in demand in the HK industry. In a rare starring film role for Miu Kiu Wai he has more than enough presence to be a capable leading man but there is no doubt that he is more suited to the small screen than the silver screen.Let's not forget that the film contain someone called Eason Chan who may seem to be miscast somehow managed to look more convincing than the rest of the cast. Neo have always claim that Chan is an actor filled with unlimited potential ever since his dramatic performance in Funeral March and since then have gone on to prove the current reviewer correct in flicks like Love Battlefield and Crazy N the City and last year's critically acclaimed The Pye Dog.

Andy Lau also appears here and there in his postInfernal Affairs role as a cop who seems to worry more about his CYMA watch and his stylish suit than anything else.With that being said Brothers is by no means an outright bad film but it is just a genre film that takes no new risks and no new turns. The result is an efficient emotionless and ultimately flat head average flick that never seems to attempt to rise above genre conventions.

In what should have been an emotional final sequence Chiu misses the mark and perhaps also due to the stoic role of Miu Kui Wai the audience never feels for the lead and the effect is a feeling of distance than relating.All in all Brothers isn't a film that plays itself very seriously and perhaps it is the main reason why it did not work when a film focus more attention to product placement than developing characters you know that the audience is far better off switching to some TV commercials or simply stare at all those Andy Lau's posters across the MTR lines. At the end of the day the good news is that despite the obvious criticism Brothers is really an average genre flick and some moments of fun can be had as long as the audience goes in not expecting the next Infernal Affairs. Then again anything with the brand Andy Lau works in HK Neo 2008 I rate it 610www.thehkneo.com".

	onyx:emotionText "Tagline A disappointingly average genre flick  Andy Lau  CYMA Review by Neo Andy Lau in 2007 has officially become a product placement in marketing terminology and a supporting actor in the HK film industry. Look no further than his ever existing presence in nearly every single MTR stations in HK and Kowloon his every movement with that CYMA watch is noted as the busy and quickpaced HK work force steam pass without noticing every morning. In fact it have become a piece of clich that everyone have already gotten used to and making only former HK residents like Neo noticing it as he was holidaying in the small island during 200708 Xmas. When a reviewer begins a review talking about marketing and product placement it usually comes with caution that the movie isn't any good. While the good news is that Brothers isn't outright bad since it is average on the bad side there isn't really that much to talk about. Perhaps the only piece realism that director Derek Chiu is able to inflict is quite frankly Andy Lau and his CYMA watch as both are probably the most memorable and real moment in the film. Without being a condemning critic but to be honest Neo is finding it extremely difficult to forget the moment that Andy Lau took his CYMA watch off and pretends to give it to Gordon Lam. Perhaps it assists the current reviewer to bring back memories of the HK visit but really Brothers is not a film about Andy Lau or his anonymous watch rather yet another triad story.Back in 1991 there was The Tigers and there were 5 of them and moving on some 17 years later only two and a half have gone on to better things. The first two is pretty damn obvious as we need to look no further than mentioning the name of Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu Wai and the half is notably a resurrected TVB career in Miu KiuWai. Without being slack Felix Wong YatWah and Ken Tong ChunYip does make an appearance as the good and the bad respectively in Brothers but it seems more likely that both have disappeared from the spotlight for nearly a decade. Such is life as an Australian icon used to say Ned Kelly is an outlaw if you didn't realise it just goes to show how much effort and luck people like Lau and Leung and Miu KiuWai to an extent require staying in demand in the HK industry.

However one fireman realizes that what he is doing is wrong and decides to go against the degenerate society he lives in.I have read reviews of this movie calling it boring and outdated and frankly I am amazed by how ignorant some people can be.  Calling Fahrenheit 451 outdated simply because the set designs look old and because there are no flashy computer effects shows that you have completely missed the point. The people who made this were not trying to give you a spectacle they were trying to give you a message  a message that is even more important today than it was when this movie came out.Fahrenheit 451 is a fine adaptation of Ray Bradbury's classic novel about censorship. The movie changes many of the book's events but the spirit of the book is preserved. The cinematography is truly great and the score is quite powerful. The acting is also great. Oskar Werner is right on the money as Montag the fireman. Julie Christie is wonderful playing dual roles as yin and yang Montag's zombielike wife Linda and Montag's friend the young and energetic Clarisse. Cyril Cusack is also memorable as the evil Fire Captain Beatty  he isn't a cartoon villain but a very realistic and human character.You may think that Fahrenheit 451 delivers an irrelevant message. You may think that book burning is a thing of the past a relic of Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. Look around you  book burning happens every day! How do you feel about people trying to ban The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn because the word nigger is used in it?  How about whole sections of Doctor Dolittle being rewritten so that they are politically correct? Did you know that school textbooks may not make any mention of Mount Rushmore because it is offensive to a certain Indian tribe? Meanwhile we are watching our giantscreen TVs and listening to our Walkmans two inventions that were predicted by Bradbury. We are constantly plugged in and never take any time to just sit and think. Look around you  Ray Bradbury's story is coming true. I advise you to watch this movie and to read the book. Read the book first. You will appreciate the film more.I hear that a remake is in the works. No doubt it will be filled with gaudy special effects and silly Hollywood cliches. I guess I should hold off judgment until I actually see it but I doubt that it will contain any of the genius that can be found in this sadly underrated gem. It will be interesting to see what they do with the mechanical hound though....".

Their inhabitants including Werner's airhead wife Christie spend their time chatting cheerfully about how good things are when not absorbed by Cousin Pollyanna on the telly. There are no books of course. Books only make people think and thinking makes people sad. It might even prompt some to dissent. Dangerous things books.So it's illegal to own them. There is a kind of mailbox in front of the fire station where anyone can drop a note accusing his obnoxious neighbor of owning books. This activates the fire brigade led by Cusack and crewed by the ambitious young Werner and the jealous Diffring. The firemen board their flamboyantly red engine and sip to the location of the accused where they tear everything apart in their search for books. If the books are found they are piled together and set alight with some kind of flame thrower.Out of curiosity Werner slips one of the contraband books into his tunic and takes it home. Late at night when Christie is asleep and no one is around he creeps into the kitchen turns on the light and begins reading Charles Dickens' David Copperfield. He haltingly reads everything on the title page including the name of the publishers in London and New York. Then he gets to the text. Chapter One. I am born. Well I'll tell you  the guy is hooked. Before you know it he's got a secret library and he's reading everything he can secret away during his raids. His wife finds out squeals on him and leaves. Werner's last raid is on his own house but in addition to burning the pile of books on the floor he burns everything including his boss.On the advice of a criminal neighbor also played by Julie Christie he makes his escape to a group of living books who have carved a living out of the wilderness. They don't OWN books so they can't be prosecuted. They ARE books. Their names correspond to the titles of the book that each has memorized. Werner is warmly accepted by the community. He would like to be David Copperfield but we already have a David Copperfield so he becomes the short stories of Edgar Allan Poe. The final scenes show us people wandering about through the snowy woods ignoring each other mumbling aloud the words of the texts they've memorized. Presumably they live happily ever after.The picture rolls along effectively and spookily. The photography is fine and the acting is at a professional level though I do wish Oskar Werner with his rosebud mouth didn't run as if he were dancing over red hot coals gracelessly his elbows raised like an ostrich's.The main problem I had with the movie is that it might have made a good short story but it's a little thin for a featurelength movie.What I mean is that we can already see that the popularity of books  of carefully crafted reading material in general  is in decline. Newspapers and weekly news magazines are in CheyneStokes respiration. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are both losing readers while the picture newspapers still glare at us from the supermarket checkout counters. Latest headline in The Globe as I write this Obama IS a Mulsim. Another generation and they'll be historical curiosities although we may still be able to buy broadsheets full of photos of celebrities now grown old and fat. Books are in just as bad a shape. I know this to be a fact because nobody bought my books! Hardly made a dime. And they were just full of penetrating insights too! Sob. Okay. We can accept the decline of literacy as a fait accompli although we also have to note that among the many books we see curling up in pain in the middle of the bonfires we don't see any works on science technology or math. Everything burnt is a novel or a work of philosophy  the humanities but not the sciences. Well that's understandable. When was the last time a quadratic equation generated sad thoughts in anyone? But this problem is never brought up in the movie. As far as the story is concerned books are books.Another hole in the logic is this Before books can be loathed they must become important in social life. No one loathes the moon or a polymerized molecule of nitrogen dioxide because who the hell cares about them? Nobody. They're irrelevant. And that's where books seem to be headed today. Not towards criminalization but towards total irrelevance. U cnt H8 something U dnt no abt bc Ur 2 dumb.When I was in high school we read The Great Gatsby in English class. Out of the hundreds of college students I've taught there were only two who'd read Gatsby  one on her own and another in an ADVANCED PLACEMENT class. Bradbury and Truffaut are on the right track I think. Books will disappear. But not because they're illegal but just because nobody wants them anymore.That future is almost bleaker because it leaves us without any enemy except ourselves.".

Although he by all accounts was not happy about making a color film and found it a bit unsettling color is used to great effect here sparingly except for the extreme shade of red that is seen throughout.Fahrenheit 451 is supposed to be the temperature at which book paper catches fire as the protagonist Guy Montag Oskar Werner explains in a scene at the beginning. Guy is a Fireman who seems happy enough with his life until he is approached by a young woman named Clarisse Julie Christie on his way home from work one day. She starts up a conversation with him and the two become friendly. She bewilders him but challenges him to think and feel....and read. And when he arrives home we see his wife also played by Julie Christie with long hair sedated and watching the wallscreen TV of sorts...we see what his life is really like although he had told Clarisse he was happy...he is not.As his friendship with Clarisse grows he starts to secretly take home hoard and read some of the books he finds in the course of his daily work and as he reads he becomes obsessed with the books. They become his mistress and are what finally make him feel affection and warmth. And when he starts to feel and care so do we.The two single best scenes are a passionate one involving an old woman who refuses to leave her books her children as she calls them and the wonderful ending of the film. The countless painful closeups of books as they are being burned are beautifully done and difficult to watch.Truffaut was a wellknown disciple of Alfred Hitchcock's films so when Hitchcock fired his longtime music collaborator Bernard Herrmann during the filming of Torn Curtain Truffaut was thrilled to acquire his talents for his own film. The score for F451 is beautiful and the film would not be nearly as effective without it.Writerproducerdirector Frank Darabont The Green Mile The Shawshank Redemption is working on a new film of Fahrenheit 451 this year.

The Pentagon was beefing up its disinformation campaign that was later documented in David Halberstam's book The Best and the Brightest. The film is based on a novel by Ray Bradbury first published in 1953 when the hysterical Red Scares of McCarthyism were near their peak.Bradbury's writing was originally published in the second issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine. In an interview Bradbury claims that Fahrenheit 451 was his only work of science fiction.That the New Wave director Francois Truffaut agreed to direct the film was unusual. Bradbury was already an established writer who probably wanted some artistic control but Truffaut was promoting the auteur theory of film in which the director has absolute artistic control.The friction had a couple of effects on the film. Truffaut eager to begin filming wrote the screenplay before fully mastering English. Even Truffaut was disappointed in the end with the stiff flat dialog. For Truffaut Fahrenheit 451 was his first and last Englishlanguage film. This may have contributed to the flatness of the characters.Some reviewers made an asset out of the stiffness by saying that the characters deprived of serious thinking and of books and addled by drugs were themselves in fact flat soulless creatures.The central character Guy Montag Oskar Werner is a fireman. In this disturbing vision of the future firemen burn books. Books are all but banned by the government because they have conflicting ideas in them. Those ideas can make people unhappy. It is the government's job to keep people happy with drugs largescreen television and other entertainment.Let's keep it positive.The novel played on the concerns of the time when it was written. Censorship and suppression of thought mainly through intimidation was being exercised in the United States. The intimidation was being done by radio and newspaper columnists who supported Senator Joe McCarthy. The book burnings by Nazis which started in Germany in 1933 and continued until the end of World War II were still in living memory. And the world was still reeling from the horrible pictures of the explosions of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki as well as implications of the mass production of nuclear weapons.By the time the film appeared America was more concerned with race riots. So burning was a viscerally powerful theme. Lost on most viewers in 1966 was the detail that among the burned books was the film journal Cahiers du Cinema for which Truffaut wrote and that on the magazine's cover was a picture from the film Breathless written by Truffaut. Also among the burned books The Martian Chronicles and Fahrenheit 451 both written by Bradbury.SPOILER ALERT Truffaut however contributed much to the uniqueness of the film as a work of art separate from the book. From the opening credits which were spoken and not displayed on the screen to the ending in which the exiles who have devoted their lives to memorizing books recite their books while walking blissfully in the snow Truffaut's genius is there.Also a stroke of genius was the casting of Julie Christie as Monag's drugaddled wife and as the more compassionate and interested Clarisse who seduces him into reading and thinking.Like Brave New World a book by Aldous Huxley Fahrenheit 451 describes a hedonist world where the people need not think.If you like Fahrenheit 451 you might also like the 1956 animated film version of George Orwell's Animal Farm now available on DVD.".

Christie is a good plastic presence actually so that's a good choice.

There are interesting stylistic comparisons with The Prisoner television series a seminostalgic futurist cult favorite of its own which came the next year. Both the movie the t.v. show make great use of small budgets which is partly where the slightly creaky slightly endearing slightly cheesy qualities come in. So what you really end up with overall is the story or even better the germ of the storythat books are so dangerous to the big brother authorities they are outlawed.It's a brilliant premise and the movie is fun for sure and interesting. I remember being moved by it really disturbed as a teenager and maybe that's where it resides best. I've tried reading Bradbury as an adult and have some trouble with the emphasis on idea over elegance or depth of character. In fact as you can see in this movie there is no depth of character at all. Or to go an obvious step further everyone's character is subsumed by something greater either by choice or by force.This might be the bigger point implicit throughout that we are always something lesser than the requirements of life and death around us.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes the movie is slow.  Yes the sets and the costumes are very 60ish and very dated.  But it has something to say.Its depiction of a narcissistic alienated superficial mass media lobotomized culture might ring true for more than a few of us.  The movie also shows the fireman's wife as being addicted to downersuppers.  All of the normal human relations that are shown in the movie appear to be detached and lacking emotion.People are not to trouble themselves with unpleasant thoughts or feelings. Hence the banning of books and literature.  They bring up unpleasant sad and depressing subjects.  They depict too much of life as it actually is. This is troubling to people.  Consequently the government pushes drugs emotionfree and sanitized sex and witless mass media.  There is more than a little resemblance to our society of the year 2000 and heaven knows what the future will bring.Oskar Werner is one my favorites so I'm very prejudiced but I think he does an excellent job.  I think both Truffaut and Werner wanted the audience to see the fireman's partial dehumanization. He recovers much of that humanity as the film progresses.  The supporting cast was good especially the actor who played the fire chief.  Julie Christie was good in the film too although her selfconscious woodenness or manner bothered me more than Werner's.Perhaps something less than one of the great films.  But it is a very thoughtful film with a lot to say to its audiencealthough some viewers choose to focus only on its rather dated veneer.".

But it has something to say.Its depiction of a narcissistic alienated superficial mass media lobotomized culture might ring true for more than a few of us.  The movie also shows the fireman's wife as being addicted to downersuppers.  All of the normal human relations that are shown in the movie appear to be detached and lacking emotion.People are not to trouble themselves with unpleasant thoughts or feelings. Hence the banning of books and literature.  They bring up unpleasant sad and depressing subjects.  They depict too much of life as it actually is. This is troubling to people.  Consequently the government pushes drugs emotionfree and sanitized sex and witless mass media.  There is more than a little resemblance to our society of the year 2000 and heaven knows what the future will bring.Oskar Werner is one my favorites so I'm very prejudiced but I think he does an excellent job.

	schema:reviewBody "Ray Bradbury's famous novel about a future society in which books are outlawed gets the movie treatment. And the movie doesn't quite live up to the standards of the book. The basic skeleton of the novel's plot is here but director Franois Truffaut takes Bradbury's story and makes it his own. And at times the movie suffers for it. Much of the nuance and detail of the novel has been lost. Many important plot points have been changed entirely. But a movie adaptation of a novel doesn't have to be exactly like its original source material in order to succeed. Many novelbased films have changed all sorts of things about the book and been very successful. The problem here is not necessarily that there are changes but that the changes are made to no good effect. The movie's story is not as engrossing as the book's. And certainly not as entertaining. What was a thoroughly captivating book has been transformed into a very dry often downright dull movie.Right from the beginning with the first call we see the bookburning firemen go out on the movie is curiously sedate. The thrill of the novel is gone. The drama just isn't there. The story doesn't grab you. Oskar Werner's performance as the central character of Montag is rather stilted. Either Werner was very uncomfortable in his role or he was going for some kind of effect which just didn't work. The result is the character of Montag leaves much to be desired. And for a movie which is all about that character that's a problem. Montag suffers from a serious personality deficit and so does the movie. There's very little life to it. What little life there is is injected by Julie Christie's character of Clarisse. In a future world where people basically float through life as mindless zombies Clarisse dares to live and it is she who critically and fatefully opens Montag's eyes to the possibilities of the written word. Speaking of mindless zombies the other main character is Montag's wife Linda. She lives in a druginduced stupor living only vicariously through her wallscreen TV. Christie plays this part too a neat idea. The contrast between the two women is obvious and that contrast is largely what the story is about Montag finally seeing another option out there. He sees the chance to actually live a life. He sees what society has become what has been lost with literature's demise. It was a great story in its original Bradbury incarnation. But greatness eludes this movie version. The book was like lively Clarisse. The movie is more like zombie Linda. The life has been sucked out of it. The basic gist of Bradbury's story remains but with all the changes made the story as presented here is not as compelling and clearly not as entertaining. The book was a real pageturner the movie is a slowlypaced slog to the finish. In this bookburning tale the best advice is both obvious and ironic. Read the book.".

	schema:headline " Interesting Premise But Flawed";
	schema:reviewBody "A society where books are banned ! It's not a fantasy . Consider the likes of Nazi Germany  Stalin's Russia  Mao's China etc  but the flaw with FAHRENHEIT 451 lies in the idea that not certain books are banned but ALL books are banned . Think about that for a moment then ask yourself this question  How would a society be able to function under this law ? We're shown schools still exist but how do pupils learn without being able to read text  and if people can not read text then how will they be able to write ? It seems impossible that a society would still be able to function without books That flaw is down entirely to Ray Bradbury's source material but Francois Truffaut's adaptation of Bradbury's novel is very uneven in every way . Take the cast for example  Oskar Werner seems very miscast while Anton Differing is once again very type cast as a fascist  Differing's last ever role was in an episode of DOCTOR WHO where he played a Nazi war criminal !   but Cyril Cusack gives a very good performance as the fire chief . Traffaut also shows his new wave roots by casting Julie Christie  Quite unnecessarily  in two different roles . And talking of new wave this is the movie that's best remembered as having the title sequence whose credits come via a voice over as the camera zooms in on a montage of TV receivers  and watch out for the scene where it looks like we're going to be treated to a split scan sequence then for some reason we're not . To give the director credit though his visage of the near future is very recognisable unlike many directors at the time who seemed to think we'd be living in space cities by the end of the 20th century  MILD SPOILER Perhaps FAHRENHEIT 451 can be summed up by its ending .

	onyx:emotionText "A society where books are banned ! It's not a fantasy . Consider the likes of Nazi Germany  Stalin's Russia  Mao's China etc  but the flaw with FAHRENHEIT 451 lies in the idea that not certain books are banned but ALL books are banned . Think about that for a moment then ask yourself this question  How would a society be able to function under this law ? We're shown schools still exist but how do pupils learn without being able to read text  and if people can not read text then how will they be able to write ? It seems impossible that a society would still be able to function without books That flaw is down entirely to Ray Bradbury's source material but Francois Truffaut's adaptation of Bradbury's novel is very uneven in every way . Take the cast for example  Oskar Werner seems very miscast while Anton Differing is once again very type cast as a fascist  Differing's last ever role was in an episode of DOCTOR WHO where he played a Nazi war criminal !   but Cyril Cusack gives a very good performance as the fire chief . Traffaut also shows his new wave roots by casting Julie Christie  Quite unnecessarily  in two different roles . And talking of new wave this is the movie that's best remembered as having the title sequence whose credits come via a voice over as the camera zooms in on a montage of TV receivers  and watch out for the scene where it looks like we're going to be treated to a split scan sequence then for some reason we're not . To give the director credit though his visage of the near future is very recognisable unlike many directors at the time who seemed to think we'd be living in space cities by the end of the 20th century  MILD SPOILER Perhaps FAHRENHEIT 451 can be summed up by its ending . It's touching and sad and feels very European  And watch out for the injoke  but once again there's flaws with the idea of the book people . Just how much information can the average human being assimilate ? Even more importantly  How would a human being be able to keep that information in their head for the rest of their lives ?

Apparently it is Truffaut's first venture into colour film and this yields quite interesting results at times quite colourful. If you are expecting a SciFi film  set in a spacelike future with astounding special effects  you will be disappointed it's not that sort of film. This is a film where a possible set of scenarios  and 'whatifs' are put forward and explored by the filmmaker. It is believable and at times makes you think 'What if this were true?'

	schema:reviewBody "This film has a very odd feel to it when you watch itthanks in part to the unusual and minimalistic sets and special effects as well as the use of an allEuropean cast. When I first read the novel by Ray Bradbury I hadn't envisioned Montag and his crew as Englishspeaking German actors and while this seems a tad strange it does work. But this along with Oskar Werner's strangely subdued performance make this a unique film. However the oddest casting of all was Julie Christie as BOTH Montag's vacuous wife AND his eventual mistress who helps him run away from his job as a fireman.Now in this film the job of a fireman is VERY different from today's. Instead of putting out fires the firemen in the movie are agents of the government whose job it is to enforce a total ban on all books by burning them! The logic we are told is that books give people all kinds of silly ideas and lead to arguments and wars. And the people being mostly idiotic sheep like Montag's wife they blindly accept this. However after a while Montag begins to wonder and think for himself....a VERY dangerous thing indeed!! What happens next and the very bizarre final scenes in the film are really best left for you to discover yourself. I really liked the movie and book though because they have so much to say about society and freedomsomething that helps this scifi story to transcend the medium and provide a wonderful metaphor for modern life.".

We now have become a nation of extreme but fake politeness that enforces an explicit political correctness that hinders actual thoughts even when such thoughts may be offensive.FAHRENHEIT 451 is a film that anyone with conscious thought should see more than once because it exposes all these dark aspects of our own society as seen through a window into the future. The most potent imagery that comes to mind and stays with me is the one of the elderly librarian who has amassed a huge collection of books of all kinds classics controversial historical  even Mad magazine.

At a spiritual level these are enlightened souls who are under preparation for when the time comes to take over the deadened society Guy has left behind. Seeing them introduce themselves not with their names but the tomes they have become is remarkable and reflects the lengths to which Man will go to ensure his own selfpreservation. FAHRENHEIT 451 is moving on multiple levels and the dual role Julie Christie plays Mildred Guy's wife and Clarisse the woman who is the catalyst for his awakening is casting genius. We see her a walking talking Barbie doll at first and later as the woman she should have been had she rebelled against the drugs and the hedonism imposed on her.

Books provoke ideas curiosity dissent and imagination the film's fascist state believes and so all books are gathered and incinerated at 451 degrees Fahrenheit. Anyone possessing a book is placed in a mental institution. Guy Montag his name recalling a character in Kafka's The Trial is one such book burner though he also lives a secret life in which he passionately reads books. Gradually these book awaken Guy's curiosity. Around him everyone's popping pills watching reality TV waltzing with interactive media and living in a depressingly grim technodaze Bradbury's novel is said to have even predicted the invention of the Ipod or Walkman. Surely Guy thinks books are a means of fleeing this dreary reality? A means of provoking some form of change? Surely. From here on books become Bradbury's blunt metaphor for any and all knowledge. But this is a knowledge less suppressed by the state than it is rejected made clearer in Bradbury's novel by a hedonistic populace which instead seeks incessant pleasure. In a sense the books are not ignored because they are burnt but are burnt because they are ignored.Late in the film the authorities learn of Guy's book reading transgressions. Like Antoine in Truffaut's The 400 Blows Guy thus flees escaping to the woods where he finds a rebel faction in hiding. Here each person has committed a different book to memory. They are the guardians of knowledge the elite minority who preserve texts which have otherwise been lost.Like Bradbury's novel Truffaut's film is implicitly about the postliterate generation and the death of books at the hands of New Media the television internet the cinema etc. The film begins with television antennas textless opening credits the alternating colours of the visible light spectrum or old cathode tubes and features scenes in which books are literally swallowed by TV sets. The fire engine of the book burners is itself a Hollywood mobile camera cranetruck. What the film thus charts is man's transition into the postliterate age and the death of both orality and literature. Of course like Bradbury's future our Western present is one of crisscrossing multimedia. Writing and reading are still of value but only in so far as they facilitate the manipulation of other media. The postliterate society assumes traditional literacy skills but the typical postliterate is a passive literate. Books are read provided they hook dwindling attention spans or plug directly back into New Media either via form ebooks ipads or content celebrity actor biographies etc. Mentioned also in Bradbury's novel but not the film is the idea of a rise in noncombustible data a term Bradbury used to refer to an increase in any information that is incapable of producing reflection analysis contemplation comparison andor an understanding of how a political social or economic system works. What Bradbury essentially predicted was the information age an age in which everything is accessible but the sheer volume of information both junk and otherwise not only makes fishing a burden but precludes the need to find master or apply this information. Truffaut's film was ignored upon release and today still has a poor reputation. This is largely because Truffaut revokes your typical science fiction aesthetic and instead channels firstly the retro aesthetics and production design work of 1950s classic Hollywood scifi see Forbidden Planet and secondly early 50s Hitchcockian opera. Indeed Fahrenheit is one giant love letter to Alfred Hitchcock  of whom Truffaut would publish a book on a year later  with its pounding Bernard Herrmann score grand emotions sweeping orchestrations snappy cutting bold colours Spellbound inspired dream sequences 360 degree spins and punchy whiplashlike camera work. In addition to this actress Julie Christie plays a pair of double roles like Kim Novak in Vertigo and actor Oskar Werner becomes your typical Hitchcockian running man as an Austrian outsider who hid from the Nazis Oskar's real life echoes Truffaut's film. Truffaut even films some sequences backwards to give the film a dreamy surreal edge.So at its best Truffaut channels the baroque bombastic tone of Hitchcock which is why Farenheit tends to be liked only by those intimately familiar with directors like Hitchcock or Brian De Palma. Like Fahrenheit Hitchcock's later films and De Palma's own oeuvre are similarly shunned. There is a perception that this aesthetic style  expressionistic dreamy operatic  belongs solely to a naive era of cinema. It can not slip past the late 1960s. Today's rise in rationalism and the corresponding rise in insincerity negates Hitchcock's brand of deadpan sincere expressionism. Though prophetic Bradbury got two big things wrong. The intellectualism and bookishness that he celebrates was always marginal and elitist. The post literate society simply forces this elitism to take a different shape. His big mistake though was in assuming that a future state would ban all art. Today's reality is not the barren censored repressed world of Bradbury but the cultural overload mediasaturation and hyperhedonism of A Clockwork Orange. Put art everywhere give it to everyone commodify everything and everybody and you effectively neutralise art books objects and people. This is what German philosopher Herbert Marcuse in his book One Dimensional Man called repressive desublimation. Marcuse saw that postmodern capitalism had internalised critique and would increasingly resemble a perverse hybrid of Sovietstyle totalitarianism and USstyle consumerism. In this world commodities art and objects are not just a means of distraction but the Ideology itself. In a world where nothing is repressed where certain forms of desublimation freedom are encouraged and where everything theoretically can be yours attention is drawn away from the oppressive and authoritarian character of society and there becomes no practical grounds for rebellion.

I've seen some Nicolas Roeg movies so in that department I had expectations.The beginning is great altho somewhat theatrical but the idea of announced credits with some nice visual trickery and the concrete suburbs of 60s London was a great starter for the movie I was really excited. Too bad it was all downhill after this.First off Oskar Werner is horrible in the lead role just amazingly bad. I just kept thinking how the movie would've been if they'd cast someone with even a little bit of charisma in the role. Werner was so uninspired and tired all through the movie. Afterwards I read that he and Truffaut didn't really see eye to eye and it shows it really shows. I was also distracted by his accent. I didn't know him before so I thought he was french but at times his accent was clearly German I don't know if he was supposed to be British German French ...Julie Christie does a good job but the double role is somewhat weird. She's good as Clarisse but the role as Montags wife is a bit soso. There doesn't seem to be a clear idea behind the double role. Cyril Cusack does by far the best role in the movie he's the only one who seems to have a clear idea of his character. Anton Diffring's main character is left as a shadow of what it could be and why was he cast as the headmistress also? It looked as a joke when heshe peaked from the window. I'd understand this choice of using just a few performers to portray many people if Truffaut had deliberately wanted to show that people are the same mass and alike but this idea is not really executed very well.The whole script is a bit lacklustre in my opinion. The idea and premise are very interesting but what ended up on screen is just dull and uninteresting.There are times when the movie looks good I would've liked to see more of this early spring concrete suburbia. But instead you get to see the country side. Nothing really wrong with that either but the locations don't really match you get no idea how the world really looks in this dystopian future. The monorail gets amazingly lot of screen time Truffaut must've thought it looked really futuristic. The scenes in the cafe in the city or something I don't know look very much like a studio and are not that great really.You also see a lot of the fire truck driving. This looks actually quite comical as the firemen are standing stiff and just holding a pole with one hand while the truck is driving really fast.I wasn't too impressed by Nicolas Roeg's cinematography either. They must've had the worst dolly grip in the world as the camera was shaking like crazy when ever there was a moving camera. Then there's this one single scene that introduces a split screen kind of effect covering the other side of the screen with black matte. What was that about?Such a frustrating movie to watch. You want it to get better as it goes but it never does.".

Guy Montag is a firefighter who lives in a lonely isolated society where books have been outlawed by a government fearing an independentthinking public. It is the duty of firefighters to burn any books on sight or said collections that have been reported by informants. People in this society including Montag's wife are drugged into compliancy and get their information from walllength television screens. After Montag falls in love with bookhoarding Clarisse he begins to read confiscated books. It is through this relationship that he begins to question the government's motives behind bookburning. Montag is soon found out and he must decide whether to return to his job or run away knowing full well the consequences that he could face if captured...Fahrenheit 451 is a bizarre but also very interesting film. This futuristic tale is obviously about individuality and freedom and it draws some interesting parallels to our society if you think about it the film was made in 66 only 21 years after the World War II where too there was intellectual repression and manipulation trough the media. Visually the film looks a bit dated of course but at the same time it does look incredibly futuristic and at the time it came out it must have made an even bigger visual impact. The sets the props and the costumes are all amazing and very well done. I don't think I'll ever forget the image of the firefighters in their black sleek uniforms running around in their futuristic red truck. The main character Oscar Montag was nicely played by Oskar Werner but the films belongs to the insanely beautiful Julie Christie who played the roles of Montag's wife and school teacher Clarissa. Not only is she gorgeous but she is a delight to watch. Fahrenheit 451 is odd but it's definitely an interesting film and the concept is quite clever. It deserves to be seen for its originality.710".

Sure it would never happen in real life but it certainly would be every soldier's fantasy that it could happen.  And that would keep a lot of spirits up in cold fox holes.

	schema:headline " A movie that's great fun with a sad ironic undercurrent";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a great fan of the late John Garfield. If you are a Garfield buff it may surprise you to learn that anyone would consider Hollywood Canteen a great Garfield film since he's on screen for such a very short time and since he did so many more substantive vehicles like Body and Soul Gentleman's Agreement The Breaking Point and Force of Evil.But you'd have to understand that the idea for the real Hollywood Canteen originated with Garfield supposedly after he paid a visit to the famous Stage Door Canteen in New York. He got together with Bette Davis and between them they persuaded all the major studios to support a similar place in Hollywood where servicemen could relax have fun and mingle with movie stars.The movie's plot is utterly preposterous but that makes no difference. The chemistry between stars Joan Leslie and Robert Hutton is wonderful. Joan's role was originally to have been played by Ann Sheridan but she turned it down because she too thought the idea of a soldier on leave falling in love with a movie star at the Canteen and actually getting a chance to spend some with her was ridiculous.In my opinion Joan turned out to be absolutely perfect. She was quite young when the movie was made only 18 or 19 but one of Warner Brothers' most popular actresses of the early 1940s.Formal reviews of Hollywood Canteen at the time it was released tended to pan the movie even though it was a commercial success. But for today's audiences it's two hours of great fun. There are terrific song and dance numbers by some of Hollywood's best.The great irony of this movie has to do with what happened to John Garfield. Declared 4F because of a heart condition Garfield repeatedly tried to enlist but was turned down. He gave tirelessly of himself entertaining troops in USO shows stateside and in Europe. Even Bette Davis acknowledged that he was the driving force behind the Canteen.So it is inconceivable to me that someone who gave so much of himself to the war effort could have been blacklisted as a communist sympathizer. His career and his life were ruined and he died suddenly in May 1952.As the great playwright Clifford Odets wrote in his letter to The New York Times the Sunday after Garfield died Despite any and all gossip to the contrary I who was in a position to know state without equivocation that of all his possessions Garfield was proudest of his American heritage even rudely so.Anyway enough of this heavy stuff. If you get a chance to see Hollywood Canteen don't miss it. It's great entertainment.".

If you are a Garfield buff it may surprise you to learn that anyone would consider Hollywood Canteen a great Garfield film since he's on screen for such a very short time and since he did so many more substantive vehicles like Body and Soul Gentleman's Agreement The Breaking Point and Force of Evil.But you'd have to understand that the idea for the real Hollywood Canteen originated with Garfield supposedly after he paid a visit to the famous Stage Door Canteen in New York. He got together with Bette Davis and between them they persuaded all the major studios to support a similar place in Hollywood where servicemen could relax have fun and mingle with movie stars.The movie's plot is utterly preposterous but that makes no difference. The chemistry between stars Joan Leslie and Robert Hutton is wonderful. Joan's role was originally to have been played by Ann Sheridan but she turned it down because she too thought the idea of a soldier on leave falling in love with a movie star at the Canteen and actually getting a chance to spend some with her was ridiculous.In my opinion Joan turned out to be absolutely perfect. She was quite young when the movie was made only 18 or 19 but one of Warner Brothers' most popular actresses of the early 1940s.Formal reviews of Hollywood Canteen at the time it was released tended to pan the movie even though it was a commercial success. But for today's audiences it's two hours of great fun. There are terrific song and dance numbers by some of Hollywood's best.The great irony of this movie has to do with what happened to John Garfield. Declared 4F because of a heart condition Garfield repeatedly tried to enlist but was turned down. He gave tirelessly of himself entertaining troops in USO shows stateside and in Europe. Even Bette Davis acknowledged that he was the driving force behind the Canteen.So it is inconceivable to me that someone who gave so much of himself to the war effort could have been blacklisted as a communist sympathizer. His career and his life were ruined and he died suddenly in May 1952.As the great playwright Clifford Odets wrote in his letter to The New York Times the Sunday after Garfield died Despite any and all gossip to the contrary I who was in a position to know state without equivocation that of all his possessions Garfield was proudest of his American heritage even rudely so.Anyway enough of this heavy stuff. If you get a chance to see Hollywood Canteen don't miss it. It's great entertainment.";

You can also hear the Andrews Sisters Roy Rogers and Trigger Eddie Cantor Benny Goodman and many others.All of the women looked stunning including Davis Alexis Smith Eleanor Parker Jane Wyman Joan Leslie Barbara Stanwyck Ida Lupino Joan Crawford and an unbelievably young and gorgeous Janis Paige. There were also appearances by Dennis Morgan Jack Carson Sidney Greenstreet Helmet Dantine Paul Henried and Peter Lorre.It was all very interesting but some of the numbers went on a bite long. However if you're of that era it will bring back some tremendous memories. Hutton Barbara Hutton's cousin was an interesting actor likable and very reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart. He continued to work in Hollywood for another 30 years but never achieved stardom. Most fascinating to me was seeing and hearing Kitty Carlisle as she performed Once to Every Heart realizing that this film was made 62 years ago  and Kitty just performed her nightclub act at 95 in New York City. God bless her.By the way female servicewomen were not allowed in the Hollywood Canteen. I can't remember who it was but eventually someone started tea dances for the women soldiers to give them someplace to go on leave. For shame.".

Seeing these stars in one picture is reason enough to check it out and there are also some musical numbers to keep you entertained. I think the film works best during the first hour when we're inside the club and the various stars are just making cameos.

I've read that studios had to plan scenes with substantial black performers  i.e. those not portraying servants so that they could be cut from the movie without damaging the story. Southern white audiences demanded that. It is very much in evidence here. Unlike most of the other musical segments they have no tiein with the action on the floor.Too bad someone couldn't come up with a better story to tie it all together but the timecapsule nature of it makes up for some of that.".

Southern white audiences demanded that. It is very much in evidence here. Unlike most of the other musical segments they have no tiein with the action on the floor.Too bad someone couldn't come up with a better story to tie it all together but the timecapsule nature of it makes up for some of that.";

Robert Hutton's fixation on Joan Leslie dominates the screen play throughout. And when this duo isn't on screen a rather sinisterlooking Dane Clark is likely trying to flirt with one of several stars. Ida Lupino looks uncomfortable while he's trying to impress herThey would later star in the unjustly forgotten Deep Valley as an unlikely tragic 'looser' couple. I understand that this was supposed to allow lonely soldiers to identify with the nobody soldiers cavorting with Hollywood stars but makes for a tedious film for postwar audiences. Warner's war reliefsupporting multistar vehicles of the previous year This is the Army and Thank Your Lucky Stars have withstood the test of time as entertainment much better on the whole. Looks like Warners ran low on 'gas' for this one although there are a number of entertaining acts. More so than those other films this one was too much of a 'spot the stars' film and was partly a PR film to spotlight the existence of the canteen. This was fine during the war but of little interest to today's viewers. Yes the Andrew Sisters did a couple of songs though not their best. Don't know why they followed Roy Roger's Don't Fence Me In with their own rendition of the same song?? Eddie Cantor did a short skit but you see much more of him in Thank Your Lucky Stars. Alexis Smith was a mere 5 sec. presence vs. her beautiful romantic dance in the above film. Jack Benny is his usual arrogant boring stage self. Even Warner's premier tenor Dennis Morgan prominently featured in the above film comes off rather flat with a not very good song. On the other hand Jane Wyman and Jack Carson are entertaining with What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?. Jane should have been a singing actress in other roles besides the later tribute to Cole Porter Night and Day. In fact she once was a radio singer while waiting for some film studio to sign her. Her comment about being ReaganizedRonnie was her then husband suggests she knew something of his future political plans. Jimmy Dorsey's band backs up many of the numbers and is featured in the lively King Porter Stomp. Unfortunately he would have to dissolve his band in a few years..The lullabylike Sweet Dreams Sweetheart is sung by Joan Lesliedubbed and again near the end by Kitty Carlisle mainly for the benefit of Robert Hutton's character. But the standout performance for spectator interest is the very well choreographed dance production starring the very energetic Joan McCracken who had several Broadway shows including Oklahoma to her credit. Her dancing would be featured in only a couple of Hollywood films. One wonders why she didn't have a more prominent film career. Unfortunately she suffered from diabetes 1 and would die rather young from its complications....Rosario and Antonio follow with an excellent if stereotypical Spanish dance. Third place in the dance category goes to TriggerRoy Roger's horse who danced to Don't Fence Me In. The African American Glden Gate Quartette also showed promise with their rather nondescript novelty song.".

It is easy to see why people don't like musicals but to me they are a much better genre than given credit for.'Hollywood Canteen' is one of the good and enjoyable musicals it has some big caveats and could have been much better also a little disappointing considering the calibre of talent involved. However there are a huge number of strengths here and it is easy to get much enjoyment from it.One of 'Hollywood Canteen's' biggest problems is the story which is very thin on the ground and lacks energy in places when not a musical number. The dialogue is far too corny and sappy and often cringeworthy. There are also two problems that don't make the grade. Robert Hutton is very wooden and quite a big blank in his role. Worse is Dane Clark who is a nonentity as an actor and generates little charm or likability.Conversely 'Hollywood Canteen' looks great being very nicely filmed and with beautiful black and white. The songs are simply terrific with the enormous entertaining Don't Fence Me In the heartfelt Sweet Dreams Sweetheart beautifully performed by Kitty Carlisle and the energetic The General Jumped at Dawn.The dancing and choreography has real verve and energy that more than makes for the story and scripting flaws. The ending is very heartfelt. The film is mostly solidly directed and with the exception of Hutton and Clark there is little to dislike about the cast. Joan Leslie and Kitty Carlisle are particularly strong and there is great value generated by the Andrews Sisters and The Golden Gate Quartette. The cameos are a lot of fun too with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford looking wonderful.In summary enjoyable stuff that could have been better. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " Variety show meets WWII";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1941 America took a turn for the worse when the naval base known as Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese and was issued a declaration of war from Nazi Germany thus pulling the country into the second World War. While our military forces were combating the enemy overseas at home we also contributed to their effort by buying war bonds recycling important materials such as metal and rubber among other things. Hollywood especially had a big part in this with every major studio producing propaganda and warthemed shorts both animated and live action and feature films that encouraged our troops overseas as well as took our minds off the mayhem. Why did I give you this little history lesson you ask? Well when I said that Hollywood had a big part in supporting our own troops and allied forces they did more than just make films.In 1942 actors John Garfield and Bette Davis along with the former president of the Music Corporation of America Dr. Jules Stein opened up an exclusive club reserved only for servicemen called the Hollywood Canteen. There men who were on leave from military service whether local or from one of the allied countries got to relax and enjoy food drink dancing and entertainment from some of Hollywood's greatest performers until they were ordered to return to active duty. Many of the performers also served as waiters dishwashers and cooks believe it or not. The canteen would stay open up until the end of the war in 1945. In 1944 however the place was so popular amongst the public that Warner Brothers Pictures decided to make a musical motion picture based around the establishment.This twohour picture filmed entirely in blackandwhite had one of the biggest star rosters in film history at the time with most of the stars playing themselves including founders Bette Davis and John Garfield as well as Peter Lorre Joan Crawford Joe E. Brown The Andrews Sisters Jack Carson Roy Rogers along with Trigger the smartest horse in the movies among others. There is a story underlying this though. It's about two Army soldiers who served in the South Pacific with one of them named Slim falling in love with film actress Joan Leslie who reminds him of his past fiance. On the third night Slim becomes the millionth customer and wins a date with Joan. It then becomes a romantic drama between the two as they both have feelings for one another. Thus Joan makes it her goal to give Slim the best night he's ever had before he goes back to active duty.Aside from the story the film is mainly a variety show featuring several musical numbers and skits performed by the stars. A musical it may be but it's not the kind of musical where a character sporadically breaks into song a la Rodgers  Hammerstein in order to move the plot along. Even though the underlying storyline is put aside throughout a good portion of the picture the film does not stray from its main attraction the canteen itself and what it accomplished for our troops. The film got mixed reception from critics upon release but audiences were all over it with 40 of the ticket sales going to the real canteen.The film was enjoyable to watch and serves as a time capsule of a bright moment in U.S. history during a dark time. Warner Bros. even made a parodytribute of this film two years later via an animated Merrie Melodies short entitled Hollywood Canine Canteen which featured dogs that were reminiscent of Hollywood stars. This short can be seen as a bonus feature on the DVD. As for the film an entertaining yet informative watch for history and WWII buffs.".

Many of the performers also served as waiters dishwashers and cooks believe it or not. The canteen would stay open up until the end of the war in 1945. In 1944 however the place was so popular amongst the public that Warner Brothers Pictures decided to make a musical motion picture based around the establishment.This twohour picture filmed entirely in blackandwhite had one of the biggest star rosters in film history at the time with most of the stars playing themselves including founders Bette Davis and John Garfield as well as Peter Lorre Joan Crawford Joe E. Brown The Andrews Sisters Jack Carson Roy Rogers along with Trigger the smartest horse in the movies among others. There is a story underlying this though. It's about two Army soldiers who served in the South Pacific with one of them named Slim falling in love with film actress Joan Leslie who reminds him of his past fiance. On the third night Slim becomes the millionth customer and wins a date with Joan. It then becomes a romantic drama between the two as they both have feelings for one another. Thus Joan makes it her goal to give Slim the best night he's ever had before he goes back to active duty.Aside from the story the film is mainly a variety show featuring several musical numbers and skits performed by the stars. A musical it may be but it's not the kind of musical where a character sporadically breaks into song a la Rodgers  Hammerstein in order to move the plot along. Even though the underlying storyline is put aside throughout a good portion of the picture the film does not stray from its main attraction the canteen itself and what it accomplished for our troops. The film got mixed reception from critics upon release but audiences were all over it with 40 of the ticket sales going to the real canteen.The film was enjoyable to watch and serves as a time capsule of a bright moment in U.S. history during a dark time. Warner Bros. even made a parodytribute of this film two years later via an animated Merrie Melodies short entitled Hollywood Canine Canteen which featured dogs that were reminiscent of Hollywood stars. This short can be seen as a bonus feature on the DVD. As for the film an entertaining yet informative watch for history and WWII buffs.";

The Hollywood Canteen did exist in 1944 and did feature the efforts of stars and starlets giving their all for the GIs.Like many films produced during the WWII years Hollywood Canteen played a role in the attempts to bolster morale overseas and on the home front. What better way to do that than to create this fantasy about a GI on leave who visits the canteen meets his dream girlwho happens to be a starletand falls in love. The preposterous part is that she also falls in love with him.The GI Slim played by Robert Hutton has been dreaming about actress Joan Leslie played by herself as he served his country. Visiting the canteen his only wish is to meet Miss Leslie. Thanks to the machinations of John Garfield Bette Davis and others he gets his wish and more. Slim is a humble everyman who might have been portrayed by Jimmy Stewart except that Jimmy was dropping bombs on Germany from a B24 in real life. His pal Dane Clark is a notsohumble operator who meets another starlet from Warner Brothers who won't give him the time of day. But it turns out that the starlet is really just a studio tour guide Janis Paige. Ms. Page is really delightful in her role as the girl who eventually gives in to the soldier's rough charms.I was somewhat surprised that HC was filmed in BW. But the camera work lighting and other production values show a sense of pride despite the fact that they could have just slapped this star vehicle together. And what stars! The cast is a roundup of current talent from Warner Brothers. Since the setting is a canteen numerous musical performances are included.With violinist Joseph Szigeti as his straight man Jack Benny proves it takes a real musician to play as badly as he does.Joan McCracken is the principal dancer in the Ballet in Jive dance number. She was Bob Fosse's second wife. I was surprised when I read that she had been a rockette because of her diminutive stature but she was 5'5 and research shows that that was the minimum height for rockettes in her time.Also notable is a singing number by Kitty Carlisle.This film was a love letter to servicemen everywhere and American allies too!. As sappy as it might be it is a lovely time capsule that captures the real hopes of Americans invested in the war effort and the soldiers who fought so far from home.".

Through a comic circumstance he is later the 1000000 soldier to walk through its doors such that he gets a dream date with the starlit of his choosing Leslie again. His buddy and fellow soldier Dane Clark also gets to meet and then date someone who pretends to be an actress Janis Page but that actually just works at a studio.During the course of this 2 hour story several actors and actresses are seen as guest waiters waitresses andor bartenders as well as performers of acts at the Canteen doing little bits to entertain the soldiers andor the moviegoer. John Garfield and Bette Davis who evidently opened the facility serve as its main host and hostess respectively. Ida Lupino plays herself and someone who soldier Clark tries to impress with his broken French before he realizes she speaks it fluently. Joan Crawford also playing herself is someone Clark dances with before he asks her if anyone has told her that she looks just like ... to which she responds yes my husband. Barbara Stanwyck plays a bartender the soldiers recognize. Jack Carson pokes fun at himself as one of the waiters who introduces the fellas around.Eleanor Parker is someone that Hutton and Leslie run into on their date as she exits another nightclub. S. Z.

	schema:reviewBody "In Arnold's best period of his film career it is unquestionable that Raw Deal is his worst film from that era. Sandwiched between two of his best action movies Commando and Predator. Raw Deal is real weak by comparison. The film is a mess and it seemed that those involved with the production could not agree on what they were making. Also it would appear that funds were too low for anyone's vision to get on screen. The editing and music for this movie is really poorly done. This film is definitely lacking in a consistent tone or focus. The action scenes seem out of place as well. Raw Deal was probably meant to be a low budget police thriller. Any way you slice it this film is not a cohesive piece of work and is filled with plot holes. Arnold at this point in his career had massive physicality and charisma. However he was lacking in acting skills and was horrendous in the more dramatic scenes here. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. Even though this is not Arnie's highest quality production it still remains fairly entertaining. There is quite a bit of funny stuff heresome intentional and some not. Also there is plenty of Arnold one liners with one of my favorites You should not drink and bake. While Raw Deal is not a well made movie it is not totally unwatchable and is still quite amusing and outrageous.".

The editing and music for this movie is really poorly done. This film is definitely lacking in a consistent tone or focus. The action scenes seem out of place as well. Raw Deal was probably meant to be a low budget police thriller. Any way you slice it this film is not a cohesive piece of work and is filled with plot holes. Arnold at this point in his career had massive physicality and charisma. However he was lacking in acting skills and was horrendous in the more dramatic scenes here. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. Even though this is not Arnie's highest quality production it still remains fairly entertaining. There is quite a bit of funny stuff heresome intentional and some not. Also there is plenty of Arnold one liners with one of my favorites You should not drink and bake. While Raw Deal is not a well made movie it is not totally unwatchable and is still quite amusing and outrageous.";

	schema:reviewBody "Don't be angry with me for only awarding Raw Deal 5 stars out of 10. It's a 'strong almost a 6' 5 not a 'weak barely above a 4' 5. If that makes any sense. I think that part of the problem is that I saw this after I saw Terminator and Commando and it was a bit of a letdown. And I might have been suffering from a bit of Schwarzeneggeroverexposure. Arnold is a bit wasted here. It's as if someone mistakenly cast him in a role meant for someone like Chuck Norris. Let's face it this is a smaller scale movie with a seemingly smaller budget Dolph Lundgren or Rutger Hauer or Micheal Biehn or even that guy from Eddie And The Cruisers could have filled in for the Sman in this movie and you would hardly have noticed the difference except for a few oneliners. Not to mention the director for Raw Deal seemed to be nowhere near Cameron's or Lester's class. Same thing goes for the cast with all respect to Darren McGavin and Robert Davi. Kathryn Harrold is not a substitute for Linda Hamilton. She's OK but she's a Ford Taurus to Hamilton's Corvette Stingray. There are pacing problems too. The screenwriter felt the need to include several filler sequences that are meant to advance the plot and fill in back story and give the other cast members something to do. But most of these sequences are pretty lackluster a fistfight in a women's clothing store goes nowhere a romantic confrontation between Davi and Harrold leaves no lasting impact though it does let Harrold get off a good putdown line and the 10 minute car chase scene where a crime boss winds up hamburger is an exercise in bythenumbers padding if there ever was one good sound design though. But the last 20 minutes serves as a payoff to the first part of the film and it is basically one long bulletfest. Arnold basically shoots everything short of LAWs and RPGs at the bad guys and they obligingly miss with all their shots and fall over and die. None of this is staged with anything like the panache of the firefights in Commando or the desperate high speed runandgun highway fights in Terminator. It's all very meatandpotatoes stuff that wouldn't have be out of place in a typical CannonGolanGlobus production. But there's plenty of it and the Sman is appropriately grim and indestructible and any fan will be satisfied once the final bad guy goes down in the final hail of bullets. After 3 viewings I still don't understand why no one can hit the huge slowmoving white guy when they shoot at him but it's his movie so I'll just attribute it to Arnold's penchant for bringing a Browning Automatic Rifle to a revolver fight and let it pass. And I don't discount this movie just because it was an Arnold vehicle  I felt that his followup The Running Man was a return to form although still not as good as Terminator and Commando. Anyway Raw Deal doesn't place in the top 5 or even 10 Arnold films but any Schwarzenegger completist will want to have it and will probably find much to enjoy. And fans of Crime Story and gangster films in general will also find this to their liking.".

In this film Arnold accomplishes character development as well as action in the same movie. Although some of the characters are stereotypical gangsters his interaction with them helps solidify their presence in the movie. The movie does rank in the same category as Commando but if you love watching his movies then this one should be a real treat!".

Typically action movies aren't awarded Oscars because the character development is poor. Most of the characters die before you really get to know them in some of the films we see. In this film Arnold accomplishes character development as well as action in the same movie. Although some of the characters are stereotypical gangsters his interaction with them helps solidify their presence in the movie. The movie does rank in the same category as Commando but if you love watching his movies then this one should be a real treat!";

Well I did not fastforward through it this time... though I was sorely tempted to. It's no wonder that this movie has been mostly forgotten despite the presence of Schwarzenegger. It often has a cheap and tacky look to it for one thing. Nobody on screen seems to be having that much fun despite occasional stabs at humor. But the most surprising thing about it is that there is considerably less action than you might think. And the action when it does come isn't the least bit exciting. The most interesting thing about this movie is how closely it resembles the generic straighttoDVD action movies of recent years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Raw deal is a rather forgotten movie in Arnold's movie career. It's not strange  when you compare it to the hits like Conan The Barbarian  Terminator or Predator . Even lesser movies like The Running man and Commando easily overshadow this flick. However  it doesn't mean that you can have some fun with this flick.Arnold Schwarzenegger only agreed to star in this picture after much haggling in exchange for dissolving his multipicture agreement with Dino De Laurentiis. He had one picture left with the producer and was actually very interested in doing Total recall  but De Laurentiis objected so Raw deal  was made instead Thankfully we still got Total recall made few years later.The budget probably was rather low  because the production values are rather poor. RD looks more like one of those CannonGolanGlobus production than a Schwarzenegger movie.The editing is pretty bad. The other problem is that the movie has some identity crisis. The basic plot premise  cop goes undercover begs for a serious tone  depth and complex story. None of which appears here. So  it's no Donnie Brasco or License to kill . Arnold looks like he is trapped in a cop thriller that would suit better Chuck Norris or Rutger Hauer. He seems wasted here. The plot is a mess with plot holes  unnecessary filler scenes and action scenes that seem out of place. Oh and the ending is one of the cheesiest in action movie history.The action is strangely uninspired . Action scenes appear without any real rhyme or reason. They aren't also anything special with the exception of ending. At the end of the movie we have 20 minutes long bullet fest that obviously wants to imitate the climax of Commando. While not exactly well staged and edited it's fun to watch for all the right and wrong reasons.Arnold is obviously lacking in acting skills. He learned how to give good low key performances with Predator but before that he was very bad at acting. Here he is horrendous in dramatic scenes . In his defence his one liners are often pure gold You should not drink and bake.The supporting cast Robert Davi  Kathryn Harrold  Darren McGavin is pretty good.The rock music is fun and the use of Rolling Stones Satisfaction was brilliant. The pacing by director John Irvin Dogs of war is not bad .I give it 410. Raw deal its not Arnold's worst movie from the 80's Conan The Destroyer and Red Sonja anyone ? and is not his worst movie overall. Any Schwarzenegger completist will want to have it and will probably find much to enjoy. Even if it's pretty forgettable movie overall.".

Ed Lauter plays the cop one step behind Kominsky and last but not least is Comeuppance favorite Robert Davi as Max Keller a mob enforcer suspicious of Kominsky. I guess Kominsky's undercover name of Joe Brenner didn't convince him like it did everyone else.But honestly the star attraction here is unquestionably Schwarzenegger who when we first meet him is wearing a red and black lumberjack shirt and closely resembles the Brawny paper towel man. He quickly and effortlessly charms the audience with his winning smile even while chomping a cigar and also with his classic oneliners like you should not drink and bake and magic? Or...magnet?!!??!! His deadpan wit makes you see what the writers of The Simpsons must have seen with their McBain parodies. There's an immense amount of shooting but it's all good clean fun really.And as opposed to some of its imitators Raw Deal has impressive widescreen photography and a cool score. Some of the pop songs it uses are interesting too such as The Rolling Stones' Satisfaction which must have cost the filmmakers a pretty penny to use as well as lesserknown gems like Pamela Stanley's If Looks Could Kill. Add some humor into the mix and it all adds up to classic 80's entertainment.As you probably already know Raw Deal is foundational for your knowledge of American action films and is a true classic of the genre.

It has a bit of a slow start but the cheesiness of the last half hour is worth the crummy buildup. This movie has my vote for one of the most hilarious endings ever in an action movie Oh my god he can walk!!.  Wow really great stuff.  Check this one out if you're an Arnie fan.  My grade C".

He kicks out the windshield of his convertible turns up the Stones' I Can't Get No Satisfaction and careers through buildings runways and mountains of sand while a veritable hailstorm of bullets rains down on him. The gangsters all miss while Arnold never misses even firing from a fishtailing Cadillac. Robert Davi is good as usual though God only knows whether his playing it straight was designed to be taken seriously. Boy does he know opera. I was an atmosphere person on this film one of the gamblers in the scene in which Arnold overturns a craps table and gets into a fist fight with several massive stunt men knocked several times on my behind by one of these Boulder Dams with legs during repeated rehearsals and takes. I had a good chance to poke around the set. And what amazed me was the accuracy of the detail the property department had lavished on this movie one more of the mindless action flicks to be committed to or upon film. Arnold drives a truck through a wall and into a big room. This is the only scene in which we see the room. Yet the room is exquisitely authentic. The movie is set in Chicago which has a considerable Slavic population so ordinary pagesized notices pinned to the walls are printed  printed  in Polish. The booze is Polish vodka. It's like looking at a hairthin engagement ring of 24 karat gold serving as a setting for a big piece of paste.Arnold is just as believable as he's always been. His playing a man who is drunk on champagne is a sight to be savored. Kathryn Harrold is awfully attractive and deserves an anatomy award. If you like action flicks this should satisfy you.".

You could almost call it a 'thriller' only that would definitely be missselling it. It's more of a crime drama which has had action scenes added into it as a result of having Arnie fronting the bill and naturally wanting to play to his strengths.People may criticise the 'big man' for his lack of acting talent. I always thought he does what he does well and am normally quite happy with his performance. However he does seem to struggle a bit here and there during 'Raw Deal' leaving some of his lines coming out as a bit awkward. At least it does have a decent if not as long as usual action sequence near the end which is pretty fun where Arnie slays countless henchmen while driving round a gravelpit listening to the Rolling Stones.If you're a fan of Arnie in general you'll probably enjoy Raw Deal. Again if you just like your crimeaction films you may also get something out of it. However if you're just a casual fan of the genreactor then it may come across as a bit forgettable especially in the wake of Arnie's other hits of the day.Just don't ask Arnie's onscreen wife to bake you a cake.".

So naturally he agrees fakes his death and doesn't tell his wife a thing! Laughable to the extreme this movie would have killed a lesser mortal's career. But not Ahnold. Riding high after the Conan films Terminator and Commando I suppose he was allowed one stinker. He would follow this with Predator and Running Man to prove to the world he was still the action champ. Honestly it's not a great movie. Even for a dumb action movie it's especially stupid. But it does have a lot of funny moments most of which are unintended.

Hello people CARPENTER HAS NEVER HAD A HIT MOVIE! Besides maybe Halloween Starman Christine and Escape from New York to a lesser extent Carpenter has made bomb after bomb. Certainly the films that have the biggest following today The Thing Big Trouble in Little China They Live they all were torn apart on release. So surprise surprise everyone hates Ghost of Mars like they did The Thing. Now I am in no way comparing Ghosts to The Thing which is an vastly superior film. But Ghosts is in the same position as it will be in fifteen years time when people will look back on it and say 'Maybe it wasn't that bad.' WHICH IT ISN'T. What elements in this film aren't Carpenter? The western atmosphere? The focus on action and story and not character? Vast hoards of nameless enemies? These were all in Assault on Precinct 13. Oh wait no one liked that in 1976 because they were so brain dead they had to wait for a cult following to develop before they gave it a second chance. So it must be the structure. Is the structure with it's flashbackswithinflashbacks and weird editing any more bizarre than the corkscrew science behind 'Prince of Darkness'? Oh that's right everyone hated that in 1987. So I'm looking for the faults. That's it the action isn't very good. Oh damn it wasn't very good in 'Big Trouble in Little China' either. Wait didn't it take people fifteen years to 'get' that film as well? Maybe it's the fact that it has Ice Cube in the lead. Yeah Carpenter defiantly shouldn't have let a nonactor take the leadoh wait Roddy Piper! If 'They Live' was made in 2001 that would be bashed for having an nonactor carrying it but for some reason because it was made in 1988 blasted on release Roddy Piper's performance is the stuff of cult legend.All said and complained about if Ghosts of Mars was released in 1987 or something it wouldn't be getting bashed now. Hell Jason Statham might have been the new Kurt Russell. There's plenty of fun to be had here and Carpenter certainly hasn't 'lost his vision' as a lot of the socalled fans who are stuck somewhere around 1982 claim. If anything with Ghosts of Mars and it's OTT structure Carpenter is developing on it.Maybe it's just me but I can't understand how someone can hate Ghost of Mars and have unconditional love for Assault on Precinct 13. Give Ghosts another go and watch it with an open mind. If you can't at least do that you are not a fan of John Carpenter.".

Wait didn't it take people fifteen years to 'get' that film as well? Maybe it's the fact that it has Ice Cube in the lead. Yeah Carpenter defiantly shouldn't have let a nonactor take the leadoh wait Roddy Piper! If 'They Live' was made in 2001 that would be bashed for having an nonactor carrying it but for some reason because it was made in 1988 blasted on release Roddy Piper's performance is the stuff of cult legend.All said and complained about if Ghosts of Mars was released in 1987 or something it wouldn't be getting bashed now. Hell Jason Statham might have been the new Kurt Russell. There's plenty of fun to be had here and Carpenter certainly hasn't 'lost his vision' as a lot of the socalled fans who are stuck somewhere around 1982 claim. If anything with Ghosts of Mars and it's OTT structure Carpenter is developing on it.Maybe it's just me but I can't understand how someone can hate Ghost of Mars and have unconditional love for Assault on Precinct 13. Give Ghosts another go and watch it with an open mind. If you can't at least do that you are not a fan of John Carpenter.";

Interestingly Capenter portrays the Martian society as a matriarchy but the elements operate the same way the good guy and the bad guy differentiate from each other just for the fact that they are in opposite sides of the law but are nevertheless exchangeable. Also following Hawks' epic the vulnerability of the hero is determined by a fault or weakness Melanie's addiction to drugs is a progression of Dean Martin's alcoholism in Rio Bravo.Told in a peculiar series of flashbacks from different points of view and as in Vampires' with the use of long continual dissolves the story introduces some original points like the ghosts taking possession of human through the ears and Desolation's smart device to save Melanie with the aid of drugs. There are some plot holes yes some bad acting and gratuitous though stylized violence.

Yes his movies have shocks and violence they are the release mechanisms for all of the terror he slowly builds up neanderthals!

Anyway i liked this AWESOME scifi Thriller from the very beginning in 2001 when i first rented it on video i absolutely Love the Atmosphere in this just like carpenter does with his films he creates a scary dread filled atmosphere  here it's lonely setting on mars at an abandoned mining base is really creepy  unsettling.The cast is cool with the likes of ICE CUBE JASON STATHAMPAM GRIER  NATASHA HENSRIDGE are all great in their roles i really liked Jason Statham in this early role as a tough security officer before he became a Hollywood action hero.This is a relatively low budget movie compared to the main big movies that Hollywood make but it's great quality  has an excellent setting  really scary voodoo type crazy ancient alien spirits that possess people  turn them into crazy warriors who kill anyone it's great fun  has very good FX  really well made production design  like i said the empty doom filled atmosphere is excellent  you just want them to hide in a room  board it all up because out there is TERRIFYING!!! So yes Carpenter has made another great film in the mould of ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13  ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK it has that feel. Quick story bit a team of government security officers are sent to pick up a wanted Criminal  transport him back but find there is something very bad happening at the mining colony!!! a very exciting thrill ride with another excellent carpenter score!!! Also the futuristic train the team ride in in AWESOME looking great design  the officers uniforms look great all excellent production design!!!

The film borrows from Total Recall The Thing and Assault on Precinct 13 but still looks fresh and original. The pace is steady and the mood consistent. The electronicmetal score recorded by Carpenter and Anthrax while being uncharacteristically modern still is very much signature Carpenter. The glorious Panavision cinematography is fresh just like it was in the 80s. The then young stars Natasha Henstridge Ice Cube Jason Statham and Clea DuVall fit their roles perfectly most notably Henstridge who effortlessly portrays a woman in command and not a tough chick with a chip on her shoulder. The seasoned actresses Pam Grier and Joanna Cassidy add a punch here and there. Ghosts of Mars leans closer to Escape from LA on the fun meter but retains the quality and edginess of The Thing.

	schema:reviewBody "Mars has fascinated humans for years.  It's the closest planet to us and the only one that comes close in terms of livability.  Its forbidding landscape and dire red color scheme are magnetic at least in movies I can't tell you how disappointed I was when that little NASA toycar thing sent back pictures and Mars looks like Utah.  No red sky even.But Mars has a curse.  You just can't make a decent movie about it.  Think about all the Mars movies in history ...Attacks! Mission to... Red Planet Angry and otherwise Santa Claus vs. the Martians etc. none of which have been able to rise above the not bad not great category if even that.  The lone exception to the Mars Curse is Total Recall which is a fine film but it can be persuasively argued that it never actually takes place on Mars at all.Throw John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars on the not bad pile.  Many have argued that it's not really a Mars movie but a Western with a weird setting which is indirectly true.  It's mostly a reworking of Carpenter's classic Assault on Precinct 13 which was itself based on Rio Bravo. I wonder when John Carpenter is just going to give in and make a bonafide Western.  You can tell he totally wants to.While I'm on the subject can someone tell me why John Carpenter seems bent on titling all his recent movies with John Carpenter's as if we'll forget?  It implies oddly enough that he didn't actually direct it the way Ian Fleming's James Bond books were published long after Fleming was technically dead.Anyway the plot involves a squad from the Martian Police Force doing a prisoner transfer from a mining colony.  Mars it seems is run by the Matronage a kind of LillithFair dictatorship which is a neat twist and gives some original zip to the movie.  The transfer is quickly forgotten as some sort of primal ghostly force is possessing the locals and turning them into a bloodcrazed cabal of bodypierced mutilation enthusiasts the movie often resembles a Slipknot video run amok.  The throngs are led by a bulkedup Maximum Leader who looks like Marilyn Manson's steroidpumped older brother.  The cops and criminals join forces with the contents of the Hollywood Gun Shop and mow down the screaming hordes in an effort to escape.  One wonders why MerchantIvory didn't pick up this project.The intriguing setting the impressive visuals and some creepy early scenes build up a lot of audience goodwill which the film then chips away at relentlessly as if willing itself to mediocrity.  The narrative is clumsywith way too much reliance on flashback.  The story itself is primarily told in flashback which is understandable even if it does reveal too much about what's about to happen.  But do we really need flashbacks within the movie to show us things we've already seen?  There are also too many pointless camera tricks such as timelapse dissolves in scenes that don't merit them. The characters are needlessly stupid especially the cops they too often resort to using their guns in baseballbat fashion when they still have plenty of ammunition.The cast unfortunately is not up to the task of raising the movie above the bar.  Natasha Henstridge whose onomasticallypleasing name is inevitably abbreviated in movie criticism as that chick from 'Species' is wooden and uncompelling as the pillpopping police lieutenant.  She is standing in in the role for an injured Courtney Love who would have been more effective if less pleasant to look at.  Clea Duvall is wasted as a spacedout and mostly useless rookie she seems about as comfortable with a Beretta in each hand as Quaker Grace Kelly in High Noon.  But Duvall is at least more memorable than that other rookie whatsisname.  Pam Grier puts in a goodsport appearance as the commander but her scenes are brief.  And there is the obligatory Smart Person Who Explains It All whose line deliveries and pseudoscience are such that you will wish the others would feed her to the Manson family outside.The only standouts in the cast are Jason Statham as the weary but horny sergeant easily the most tactically compentent of the MPF contingent and Ice Cube as the prisoner whose transfer is in such turmoil.  Mr. Cube's unfocused pinchfaced rage and dumbfounded bravado are pitchperfect and he has all the funniest lines.  Ironic that in a movie about a distaffdominated society the best performances are by men.Ghosts of Mars will not rank among John Carpenter's best work and here I am specifically thinking of Big Trouble in Little China but despite its deficiencies I enjoyed it.  Carpenter still has it and when he's good he's very good.  Desperatesurvivalagainstthemurderousarmies has a primal power as a story archetype and there's plenty of gunblazing headbashing flyingbuzzsawdismemberment fun to be had by all.  The music's pretty good too.  And there's something about Henstridge and Duvall in black leather SWAT uniforms that just pushes a button somewhere.  Maybe it's just me.If you fight you can enjoy this movie in spite of its efforts to the contrary but you will be a little battleweary by the time the credits roll.  Not everyone will be inclined to put forth the effort.  But hey can you really hate a movie whose villain is billed as Big Daddy Mars?".

	schema:reviewBody " MUST READ BEFORE PAYING REAL MONEY  John Carpenter was once a really good filmmaker well at least a good director. Just think of the 1982 classic The Thing which is simply excellent. He didn't write that movie but the cinematography is very good. Unfortunately he DID write John Carpenter's Vampires a few years back and it sucked. It sucked bad. He also wrote Ghosts of Mars referred to as GOM from now on which sucks even more. I'm a fan of horror scifi monster movies and dramas.This movie is none of the above but it tries to be a horror movie against a scifi setting. It's quite tragic because all it becomes is a lame monster movie on Mars. Or wait... this movie is actually just a western in space...with monsters.SO WHAT'S BAD ABOUT IT? Well lots of things. To begin with the movie is set in the year 2176 or something. About 170 years from now. One of the first things one notices is the fashion of 2176. Remember Star Trek the original series with Kirk? Everything looked like a spaceuped 1970s right? Same here but late 90s. What about technology then? Embaressing. Almost nothing has improved. Many things are ridiculous to be set 170 years from now. Sure it's the early colonisation of Mars and tech isn't really high in the colonies. But some of the things you'll see are just silly.What about guns? There are alot of guns in the movie seing how it's a western and all. Well for starters how do Berettas and SPAS12s sound? No? Don't have a place in 2176? That's right they won't have a role at all they'll be 200 year old antiquities. There's also an automatic rifle which I've forgotten the name of. I think it's a FN model about 10 years old. What is it doing there? Oh well in the absolute ending sequence a pair ofSMGs appear that are unidentifiable as they're tailormade for the movie finally. But I must say they're some of the shiniest guns I've ever seen. The design is bad I'll accept that. But why are they so shiny? Ridiculous.WARNING SPOILER BELOWThe opening scene of GOM is a really bad attempt at copying the Ripley investigations scenes from the alltime brilliant movie Aliens. Natasha is being questioned about the recent events on Mars where she starts recanting the movie. So after about 4 minutes into the movie we already know that she's the only survivor. Great...nice spoiler. So the whole who's gonna make it is off now what? That is often the only thing movies like GOM and Pitch Black have going for them But GOM gives it away in the opening sequence. Very poor.What also bothers me are flashback scenes that aren't called for. When a person starts to explain something we are taken back to a scene we've seen and are shown it again just to know what the conversation refers to. It seems John Carpenter must've known we'd be sleeping ourselves through this movie.Again the western style is apparent the law enforcers read Sheriff and his deputies have shotguns and the sheriff has a long coat typical of western movies. There's an old style iron bar jail the railroad Mars express or whatever and a bunch of outlaws the ghosts.So what about the bad guys in the movie? I almost st a brick when I saw them. They suck bad. They are simple miners than have been possessed by the ghosts and suddenly start piercing and painting and sickly decorating themselves. It's explained as something the ghosts used to do when they were alive....sigh....Oh well they have this leader guy and he looks like a devil or something in the gothiest outfit I've ever seen in a scifi. It's leather it's black it has rings and stuff bla bla. The funniest part is when this guy issues commands or preaches to his flock. It's like he only can say one word and that word is something like waah or perhaps raah. And he wants to say these complicated sentences of about 814 words each. But all that comes out is waah waah raah raah waah waah raah waaaaaah. I almost swallowed my icecream scoop when I first heard him then I just laughed myself into a coma. And he's REALLY ped all through the movie. He's supposed to be mad because invaders the humans have set foot on his planet. But I'd say his rage is so immense that he's got a personal issue of some kind. He's just sooo mad. Maybe it's because he can't say any other words than waah and raah. I know that would ps me off.The religious manner in which his subordinates worship him with this whole primitive caveman meets Jehova's witness bent on Nazi occultism style is pathetic.THE ACTORS Natasha Henstridge ze girrrl from Schpecies can do better she's no actress nor a model but even she can do better. Ice Cube actually isn't all that bad he proved that in Boyz 'n' the Hood among other films this must be the worst performance from him that I've ever seen much due to the script.This movie so badly wants to be a good SCIFI but it can't be that because it so badly wants to be a good WESTERN but it can't be that because it so badly wants to be a good MONSTER MOVIE but it can't because the script and props suck.OK what about budget? Well John Carpenter is a name that should allow for some money to pour in. Hm...but not if the sponsors saw John Carpenter's Vampires. I believe most of the money went into making the train that traffics Mars. The design is bad humans would never build anything like that train. It looks OK though in being actually there I mean. It's OK...nothing more. Explosions are plentiful the ghosts have dynamite and bad. Everyone's on a springboard and fly in a predictable trajectory in order to not hurt themselves. Typical ATeam action complete with tons of clichs and lame Wesley Snipeslike comments.Do I sound a tad irritated? That is because I payed good money to view this movie. I feel people have the right to know what to expect as I have the right to be upset about what I saw. This review contains no profanity so there should be no reason to not post it.Overall  I gave it a 1 in my vote. When disc 1 had finished I had to think for approx 10 seconds if I wanted to load disc 2. Or as my Japanese female friend would say  Suckysucky.Medusa 2001".

	onyx:emotionText " MUST READ BEFORE PAYING REAL MONEY  John Carpenter was once a really good filmmaker well at least a good director. Just think of the 1982 classic The Thing which is simply excellent. He didn't write that movie but the cinematography is very good. Unfortunately he DID write John Carpenter's Vampires a few years back and it sucked. It sucked bad. He also wrote Ghosts of Mars referred to as GOM from now on which sucks even more.

I know then why his movies are flops at the theatrical release?  'cause there's a problem with uspeople to understand his films that are really oldfashioned aiming rather at the people in the 60's70's and that's the only Carpenter's flaw as a director his bad timingmaybe born out of time. But when his movies at its core are good it's only a matter of time to be fancied. I think we should start appreciate such a director who's devoted to an old genuine filmmaking and not to these days where everything has to be big right in your face. I love his subtle style especially in future classic as Ghosts Of Mars. This film is very essential it represents every directorial aspect what John Carpenter uses in other filmshardy women equal to men defiance against authority etc.. but it's not just a hotchpotch of his early works it has its own lowkey style and Forbidden Planetlike feel it combines genres Scifi Horror Western Action Comedy it has a messageperhaps Carpenter's biggest at all that beautifully reflects us. I know it is a BMovie it has a silly dialogue silly situations but that's exactly what Carpenter wanted and he takes all these elements to encapsulate into its own form and never let it slip out it never tries to be serious it never tries to be something what it's not there's nothing what doesn't fit in that's what i can't say about for example Kill Bill something what should these young filmmakers learn from. i've been watching Carpenter films since the early 80's and still like them all so i'm deadly serious when i'm rating Ghosts Of Mars as a masterpiece and one of his best that will certainly stand the test of time especially for its form and uniqueness. Somewhere i read a review where one guy as if justifying himself likes this movie only because he's a Carpenter fan but on the top of that i have to tell you that's what it's all about only his fan can recognize his masterful touches that he's a true author and that's why he has more cult filmswhich most of them were then supposed to be a failure than any other director.".

	schema:headline " A rocking trip to Mars...";
	schema:reviewBody "Ghosts of Mars is one of John Carpenters strangest movies but also one of his most fascinating mostly because the things most people seem to hate about it are actually the reason why it works in his unique way.The most unique part of the film is the storytelling itself while watching the movie you MUST keep in mind that we get to see the story told from the perspective of the only survivor who is on drugs for most of the movie. That means that all could be just part of our protagonists trip. Besides that all the things that happened without her being present are obviously just how she imagines them to be this is also the reason for the odd scenetransitions.That's said is the story even worth telling? In my opinion Yes because it's damn entertaining. After watching it the second time i liked it even more because i now understood how the storytelling worked and got all the Carpenter references and this movie has lots of them which is why it's even more fun if you are a fan of his work and understand what he's going for.But now to the technical part This movie is beautifully shot with a great understanding of how to use the anamorphic lens and lighting which are things we are used to see in a John Carpenter flick and capture really well the atmosphere and look of a lived in but abandoned Mars station.The editing is very experimental and like i said effectively represents the story structure and the state of mind of our protagonist.Also the practical effects and make up is helmed perfectly by some of the great masters like Howard Berger Robert Kurtzman and Greg Nicotero.The visual effects do their job and nothing more which is also due to a tiny budget but Carpenter always made movies which looked way bigger than they actually where at the time and this movie used way less CGI as most of the other movies at the time which were in a state of experimenting with what they could do. But the CGI effects used in this film like the first very good looking shot of Mars works really well the only downside are some obvious greens screen shots but there are just one or two to be seen.One of the most entertaining aspects for me are the great choreographed and executed action sequences. The fights are perfectly captured no quick cuts or shaky cam to be seen just the actors and stuntman kicking serious ass. One of my favourite shots in the film is one when all of our heroes fight against a horde of enemies in a narrow corridor. The camera is steady and we just watch them participating in a very real looking fight.The other most entertainingly awesome aspect of this film is the insanely awesome soundtrack. Carpenter is known for composing his own soundtracks and the result is always great but this is the one you'll have the most fun hearing even without watching the movie httpsyoutu.benkQ80xVsSoE?listPLDmdF1ma6cZrU2oO96SqeEUepwOM3Tv3 Carpenter worked with Buckethead from Guns n' Roses and the band Anthrax and while watching one of the final action scenes of the movie and listening to the kick ass title drop music i said to my buddy that this movie looks like the kind of film you imagine in your head when you see the cover of a Metal album...The actors all do their job pretty fine and it's nice to see a strong female lead who kicks ass and is in charge for a reason or not?.Which is also the tone the movie is going for at my first viewing i liked the film but was a little led down that it wasn't more moody like Vampires instead of action oriented but after i understood that it was supposed to be fun action and most of all a kinda drug trip i fully appreciated it and was highly entertained.Also for people who still don't believe that this movie is supposed to be the wishful fantasy of our addicted protagonist the last shot of the film is the most obvious hint. But the scene that sells this idea the most is when our protagonist get's possessed by one of the Ghosts but the drugs save her live and give her weird visions which tell her nothing that she didn't already knew instead they underline a theory one of the characters told her without any kind of proof so that she clearly believes all the weird stuff that happens...I highly recommend this entertaining scifiactionfilm to anyone who wants to see his favourite Metal Cover come to life and to fans of Carpenter's work who get the most out of it...".

After watching it the second time i liked it even more because i now understood how the storytelling worked and got all the Carpenter references and this movie has lots of them which is why it's even more fun if you are a fan of his work and understand what he's going for.But now to the technical part This movie is beautifully shot with a great understanding of how to use the anamorphic lens and lighting which are things we are used to see in a John Carpenter flick and capture really well the atmosphere and look of a lived in but abandoned Mars station.The editing is very experimental and like i said effectively represents the story structure and the state of mind of our protagonist.Also the practical effects and make up is helmed perfectly by some of the great masters like Howard Berger Robert Kurtzman and Greg Nicotero.The visual effects do their job and nothing more which is also due to a tiny budget but Carpenter always made movies which looked way bigger than they actually where at the time and this movie used way less CGI as most of the other movies at the time which were in a state of experimenting with what they could do. But the CGI effects used in this film like the first very good looking shot of Mars works really well the only downside are some obvious greens screen shots but there are just one or two to be seen.One of the most entertaining aspects for me are the great choreographed and executed action sequences. The fights are perfectly captured no quick cuts or shaky cam to be seen just the actors and stuntman kicking serious ass. One of my favourite shots in the film is one when all of our heroes fight against a horde of enemies in a narrow corridor. The camera is steady and we just watch them participating in a very real looking fight.The other most entertainingly awesome aspect of this film is the insanely awesome soundtrack. Carpenter is known for composing his own soundtracks and the result is always great but this is the one you'll have the most fun hearing even without watching the movie httpsyoutu.benkQ80xVsSoE?listPLDmdF1ma6cZrU2oO96SqeEUepwOM3Tv3 Carpenter worked with Buckethead from Guns n' Roses and the band Anthrax and while watching one of the final action scenes of the movie and listening to the kick ass title drop music i said to my buddy that this movie looks like the kind of film you imagine in your head when you see the cover of a Metal album...The actors all do their job pretty fine and it's nice to see a strong female lead who kicks ass and is in charge for a reason or not?.Which is also the tone the movie is going for at my first viewing i liked the film but was a little led down that it wasn't more moody like Vampires instead of action oriented but after i understood that it was supposed to be fun action and most of all a kinda drug trip i fully appreciated it and was highly entertained.Also for people who still don't believe that this movie is supposed to be the wishful fantasy of our addicted protagonist the last shot of the film is the most obvious hint. But the scene that sells this idea the most is when our protagonist get's possessed by one of the Ghosts but the drugs save her live and give her weird visions which tell her nothing that she didn't already knew instead they underline a theory one of the characters told her without any kind of proof so that she clearly believes all the weird stuff that happens...I highly recommend this entertaining scifiactionfilm to anyone who wants to see his favourite Metal Cover come to life and to fans of Carpenter's work who get the most out of it...";

	schema:reviewBody "An unintentionally funny idiotic scifi action film with as many clichs as there are scenes and dialogues. Carpenter not only has nothing new to offer and directs with the inspiration of a sleepy pandabear but he has gone PC too this moronic 22nd century that he so pointlessly offers is a world of Amazon women who dominate humankind. The idea though irrelevant to the plot itself is that most men have gone sterile so the women now call the shots! Gee I never realized that the underlying cause of man's domination over women all through the ages has been solely because the penis ejects fertile sperm.Pam Grier who plays a lesbian! is the commandant! of the movie's security outfit. Her secondincommand is another woman Henstridge. And below them are three more people one of which is a teen girl DuVall who looks like she'd rather be at a Smashing Pumpkins concert. The I.P. who interrogates Henstridge is a woman. The head of the scientist research group is a woman Cassidy. And even the face on the bills of 22nd century currency is that of a woman. Perhaps the first true feminist scifi and I think women can be proud that it happens to be such a movie classic as well. Maybe I am reading too much into the movie but I had the impression that Carpenter even sent a just say no except to weak drugs message on one occasion a prisoner gets high on a cracklike drug and he gets punished for it by cutting off his own thumb in a dumb scene while the giving of a weak marijuanatype drug to Henstridge saves her from the aliens. What would we do without the fine morals of a Hollywood movie...The casting is a classic case of kidnapping. DuVall got kidnapped from the set of a teen comedy Henstridge got snatched from a fashionshow Ice Chubbs got yanked from the set of the latest intelligent rap video Cassidy got kidnapped from a TV dramaoftheweek weeper and Pam Grier... I have no idea where they got her from. What a series of brilliant casting decisions! Watching Ice Chubbs and Henstridge go into a verbal ttette is a rare cinematic Offenbarung and a new bigscreen highlight. But I'm being unfair no one can help appearing stupid with such dull dialog and such a trite plot. And Henstridge is at least nice to look at even if they did try to make her into a Weavertype alienkilling man on an occasion or two.The premise is just too boring for words but here it is aliens take over human bodies. YAWN. The premise of a supertough serialkilling prisoner cooperating with the good guys against the forces of evil is nicked right out of the equally trite Pitch Black which probably itself stole it from some other movies. The alwaysscreaming leader of the alien zombie squad is almost identical to the main vampire in Carpenter's previous movie. What confuses me is why Carpenter saw fit to cowrite a disjointed story much like the brokenform type in Tarantino's or Ricthie's movies it's completely ridiculous and pointless for this kind of linear dull plot. I was also surprised that Carpenter a tired old man by now decided to write an industrialmetal score.There are plenty of idiotic and subpar moments. One of the most hilarious ones is undoubtedly when Henstridge finishes her long story to the mostly female commission and the main I.P. says to that is that all you have to tell us?! Oh sorry for not giving you enough gory details and for not telling you that 10 million people got their heads cut off but I'll try next time your Highness! What's worse they don't believe a word she says! Well at least that shows that women would be just as dumb if not more so than men if they were in power.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a fan of John Carpenter it was mentioned  when i gave my review of  They Live  that i should see his movie Ghosts of Mars. I'm not sure if this was a recommendation or a suggestion just so that i could see that Carpenter is capable of make bad movies as well as good ones. I can only think it was the latter. Ghosts of Mars is a tale of rescue and escape from a colonized Mars 175 years into the future. Mars 2176 AD. Long inhabited by human settlers it has become the dark and dangerous manifest destiny of an overpopulated Earth. 640000 people now live and work at farflung outposts all over Mars mining the planet for its abundant natural resources. But one of those mining operations has uncovered a deadly mother lode a longdormant Martian civilisation whose warriors now unleashed and apparently unstoppable are systematically taking over the bodies of human intruders bent on ridding the planet of the invaders from Earth. Every good director must have a piece of work that they are not too proud of. I don't know if John Carpenter is happy with the final outcome of this film but I'm pretty sure most of his fans aren't. Carpenter describes Ghost of Mars as a Western set in space  If only it this was a good as he makes it sound. The thing that i like about John Carpenters movies is that they are not perfect. They nearly always have a raw look . You could almost describe them as having and amateurish look  and that isn't a criticism. This is different though  GOM is a mess of a movie that looks and feels rushed . The story is good in theory but in practice is badly told. There are important characters that just disappear from the story without explanation and plot holes bigger than a Moon Crater.Another problem i have  is with Rappers who think they can act. Most people who know me will know i dislike rap music . I would go as far as to say it's not even a form of music but that's a debate for another day . There is one things that irritates me more than rap and that is rappers who go into acting. I cannot think of one rap artist who has made an impression on me in a film apart from Will Smith  does he count as a rapper? . Ice Cube is no exception . He scowls his way through this film and look completely out of place. It might have helped if he tried not to play the role like he was a gangster rapper . who knows? perhaps we will be sending the future equivalent of 50 Cent to Mars in years to come......Not a bad idea! Natasha Henstridge does a pretty good job as does Jason Statham but the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable.For the gore fans out there this film will not disappoint . There are plenty of blood splatter and severed limbs but it's still not enough to make this film anything other than John Carpenters worst film i have seen to date.4 out of 10".

He did 'The Thing' which is by far the best horror movie of the 80s he created the masterpiece 'Big Trouble In Little China' and let's not forget about 'Halloween'. After the commercial failure of 'The Thing' and 'Big Trouble In Little China' one the biggest injustices ever he made very low budget movies which were still pretty good.Since 'Vampires' Carpenter feels he must compete with the new directors a wrong idea as his early work still remains classic so he started copying from Robert Rodriguez like crazy. 'Vampires' was a lame version of 'From Dusk Till Dawn' and a copy of Rodriguez's techniques. In 'Ghosts of Mars' he does the same. He still copies from R.R. by using extended slow motion while cross fading with another shot and the funny thing is that he once said that he is completely against the use of slo mo in movies which in my opinion is right.Apart from the direction the story is bad there is absolutely no interest in what happens here and there is no horror.J.C. always managed to work with decent actors but not here. I don't like seeing someone called 'Ice Cube' star in a John Carpenter movie really. Of course with a script like this he couldn't find anyone better.I am sorry to see that Carpenter has lost his gift the ability to transform a small budget movie into something which is at least interesting.Maybe he should take a rest or use someone else's stories from now on.110".

It would be nice to see a really thoughtprovoking science fiction film that consisted of more than a motley group of people trying to escape from some monster.  Given this Ghosts of Mars is really a pretty decent film and John Carpenter's best in some time.I really wanted to like Vampires and much of that was pretty good but the small budget really hurt.  Here Carpent uses the budget limitations to positive effect.  Most of the money apparently went for red dye for the ground.  The buildings and futuristic train didn't require much.  The story basically boils down to the basic stalk and slash as dozens of other science fiction films of recent vintage but there isn't a lot of time wasted on extraneous plot.  The story is welltold via a pretty complicated series of flashbacks and even flashbacks within flashbacks as a group of gungho Martian police attempt to pick up a transport a prisoner played by Ice Cube only to discover that the mining station where he's being held has been overrun by the spirits of dead Martians who inhabit their host bodies and make them do their bidding.  The story is also basically an updating of one of Carpenter's earliest films Assault on Precinct 13.  Along the way there are intriguing glimpses at the matriarchical society that runs Mars although it is never explained how or why things got to be this way.  Carpenter supplies some neat music to the film's soundtrack as well.  All in all there are certainly worse ways to spend your money.".

Some modern scifi movies such as Pitch Black has meaningless posturing and insulting and bad manners but in this movie people insult others with a grin. On some occasion the director even lets the viewer's nerves rest with compassion and gentleness. This is an intelligent action movie which takes a lot of nerve with it's sharp Carpenterstyle violence and brutality and perhaps suits best for people who choose to listen heavy rock and hang out with motorcyclists. Perhaps too hardcore for my taste. Still this movie is A not B as some have said a classy movie with the vision of a great director. It is very consistent and the scifi features are captivating.".

A Story we've already seen before in Rocky and its many clones.Set in a future where the only difference seems to be fighting robots. Hugh Jackman plays an out off work boxer and grade A ahole who is hopeless at getting new robots fighting. Jackmans life is supposedly turned around when the son he abandoned as a baby turns up and helps in finding an old robot who ends up being great in the ring.As I wrote above the film starts off well. Jackmans playing a character that only cares about money and winning until the kid turns up. Even the kids doing well until he starts teaching the robot how too dance and yes he even teaches him the robot sigh! and like most over confident child actors becomes the irritating ccky kid in the movie.I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying that the old robot wins and Jackman ends up caring about more than just himself by the end off the flick but the way they go about this is seriously corny and the way in which Jackman started out makes me not want too root for him so much by the end.Overall the films story maybe isn't as predictable as you'd think and is saved from a worst rating by this and its light sprinkiling off funny moments and cool robot designs. Round one though is better than round two. Which seems determined to outdo Rocky and all its many imitators in an attempt to win the award for corniest movie ever.".

Even the kids doing well until he starts teaching the robot how too dance and yes he even teaches him the robot sigh! and like most over confident child actors becomes the irritating ccky kid in the movie.I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying that the old robot wins and Jackman ends up caring about more than just himself by the end off the flick but the way they go about this is seriously corny and the way in which Jackman started out makes me not want too root for him so much by the end.Overall the films story maybe isn't as predictable as you'd think and is saved from a worst rating by this and its light sprinkiling off funny moments and cool robot designs. Round one though is better than round two. Which seems determined to outdo Rocky and all its many imitators in an attempt to win the award for corniest movie ever.";

I was actually surprised. It had some great plot twists it had a real story line. And while yes there is some language sprinkled throughout it did make a good family movie for older kids 10 my opinion. The ending wasn't quite what I was expecting but looking back I think I liked it better for that. Who wants an ending they can see coming the entire movie?It had some great comedy moments. The relationships between the actors felt genuine and not overdone or forced. The robot animatronics was good. The robots themselves were fun and imaginative and definitely made me wish we really had this sport. I would so be there!".

But i had no idea how bad it was going to be. At least Goonies 2 i mean... Super 8 managed to actually be entertaining. This movie has no surprises it's just predictable turn after predictable turn.The acting is terrible across the board but i can't blame the actors for not putting an effort into such a depressing tale. Goyo is a promising talent unfortunately the lines he was given are so outofcharacter and cheesy for a kid his age no amount of talent could be convincing. He likes Robot boxing and he's so into video games he's even fluent with Japanese but he's no nerd he's all grownup and can haggle like a moroccan couscous salesman on a couscous black Friday and to top it all off he looks like the coolest kid ever even though his mom has just died days ago. And like that's not horribly incongruent enough he spends half of the movie showing off his dancing skills like a Bieber wannabe. That's one seriously schyzophrenic kid!But the bad acting and atrocious storytelling doesn't end there. Some of the people in Real Steel are more cartoonish than the robots Ricky Tak Mashido Farra look like villains out of a Disney Channel Show. Most of the footage of James Rebhorn and Hope Davis should've stayed on the cutting room floor. They are lost on screen clearly with no chemistry as a couple and not enough lines on the script to work with. Every time they're interacting on screen you can actually crack a laugh at how they flay their arms at each other clueless like two crashtestdummies in slow motion. But the way they keep awkwardly eyeballing Hugh Jackman during every lousy dialog like they're asking to be put out of their misery just makes you terribly sad again.The final scene with everyone crying in rapture at Hugh Jackman performing videofitness had me ripping hair out of my head! I'm in awe of all the positive reviews this movie is getting. Either this movie premiered on IMDb's opposite day or i had no idea this site had such a huge userbase of 9 year olds.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a little gem Real Steel could have been. Well before its release and before any intricate plot details became known this sounded like an intelligent film in which robots are forced to engage in brutal fights for the entertainment of their human masters. Where the story would've gone from there is left to the imagination but it appeared to have all the makings of critically acclaimed selfconscious science fiction. The final product differed heavily from initial expectations however and we are left with a hollow albeit bearable alternative prompting those such as myself to ask What could have been?In the very near future 2020 according to director Shawn Levy the human art of mantoman combat has become obsolete. Onetime fighters have been replaced by robots that do the dirty work while their human controllers reap the rewards. Charlie Kenton Hugh Jackman is one such promoter recently down on his luck and who lives not for the bright lights but to make just enough money to survive. At this most inopportune time he is forced to take care of his estranged son Dakota Goyo whose burgeoning friendship with an outdated sparring 'bot named Atom convinces Charlie to give the big time one last shot.For a movie that has the skeleton to accommodate exploring the concept of human qualities in machines a la Blade Runner or Artificial Intelligence as well as warning pretentiousness ahead the theme of 'ethics and morals of humanity' it actually does everything it can to avoid those topics entirely. My hopes for such a film were all but dashed with the casting of a child a sure sign that the story would be strictly focused on Max and Charlie's relationship and in that respect the plot seems unnecessarily restricted. This results in an inherently outofplace scene in which Atom all alone before a big fight gazes into a mirror as if to question his existence. Its inclusion into the final cut is sure to whiz above the heads of its preteen target audience while more mature viewers might interpret it as a cheap attempt to inject some heart far too late into the story.Indeed its familyfriendly status is the biggest letdown of Real Steel. At the forefront is the misguided characterisation of Charlie's son who is portrayed as in my opinion a spoiled brat who's so cocksure of himself all the time that a little part of you wants to see him fail. The child as an authority figure may appeal to those of Max's age but it detracts from the contrasting gritty realism of Jackman's character and shuts down any hope of characterbased realism in the process. Other attempts to please the male tween market include obvious allusions to toy lines and video games as well as a mindboggling assault of product placement which becomes more than a little irritating during the second half.The script is not disastrous. The writers dabble in clichs occasionally but not quite to the point where it numbs the mind. On a more negative note the screenplay does allow for an assortment of cringeworthy moments which some might call 'heartwarming' depending on personal perspective that include dancing robots and the introduction of more than one excessively cartoonish side character again limiting the level of engagement one can make with this movie.The action set pieces in the film were visually pleasing exploiting a decent amount of camera angles to give the viewer an intriguing look into the mechanics of robot rumbling. The CGI is impressive and the clunky as opposed to slick movements of the robots actually work well reflecting what a realistic fight between two heavy machines would look like. Jackman does his best as always but he alone can't salvage a oncepromising prospect that instead settles for being the very definition of blockbuster mediocrity.There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsisiprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.".

	schema:headline " No splitting this Atom it has got a rock solid heart.";
	schema:reviewBody "Real Steel is directed by Shawn Levy and collectively adapted to the screen by John Gatins Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven from a Richard Matheson short story called Steel. It stars Hugh Jackman Dakota Goyo Evangeline Lilly Anthony Mackie Kevin Durand Hope Davis and James Rebhorn. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Mauro Fiore.Set in the near future robot boxing is a big crowd pulling sport. After a struggling robot operator is introduced to an 11yearold son he has never known they stumble upon a discarded robot at a junk yard....We can all moan about the mimicry of an idea and the clichs that dominate Real Steel but you really got to hand it to the makers for what they have achieved. They have crafted a family film that's perfect in this day and age. The story is one that any adult Sylvester Stallone fan can acknowledge and appreciate the human heartbeat pleasingly steady while the premise of big colourful robots beating the crap out of each other delights youngsters and us adults who are young at heart. Film pretty much does what any other film of this type does lays on the syrup in the last quarter where second chances and family strife come thundering through the plotting.

	onyx:emotionText "Real Steel is directed by Shawn Levy and collectively adapted to the screen by John Gatins Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven from a Richard Matheson short story called Steel. It stars Hugh Jackman Dakota Goyo Evangeline Lilly Anthony Mackie Kevin Durand Hope Davis and James Rebhorn. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Mauro Fiore.Set in the near future robot boxing is a big crowd pulling sport. After a struggling robot operator is introduced to an 11yearold son he has never known they stumble upon a discarded robot at a junk yard....We can all moan about the mimicry of an idea and the clichs that dominate Real Steel but you really got to hand it to the makers for what they have achieved. They have crafted a family film that's perfect in this day and age. The story is one that any adult Sylvester Stallone fan can acknowledge and appreciate the human heartbeat pleasingly steady while the premise of big colourful robots beating the crap out of each other delights youngsters and us adults who are young at heart. Film pretty much does what any other film of this type does lays on the syrup in the last quarter where second chances and family strife come thundering through the plotting. Undeniably it's hugely derivative events are joystick operated to get an emotional response from a family audience while product placement reins and the script often sags under the weight of unoriginality.

	schema:reviewBody "Based on what everybody said Real Steal is like Over The Top plus Rocky with Robots. Over The Top because there's a man his son and a truck. Rocky because it's obvious. Put these films together and add robots and minus Stallone. Real Steel is not very innovating though but it's excitingly great and has plenty of heart. It's also the return of Hugh Jackman although we just saw him a little last June. There are lot of things to recommend in Real Steel.The premise isn't really that intriguing. It's boxing replaced by robots. Films with Giant CGI Robots are not innovating since we have Michael Bay's Transformers. But the heart and soul lies to the relationship of Charlie and Max and their robot Atom. It's fun to watch them. The fighting scenes are pretty exciting. That is what most underdog fighting movies do. The only problem here is the weak major antagonist. It's not really that threatening or a big deal. Ricky was more threatening than the gigantic Zeus.The filmmaking is pretty decent. Well shot scenes. The CGI robots and the music score are good enough. Nothing to say about the production design except Charlie's truck. It looks fascinating for some reason. The performances were great. We don't see Hugh Jackman in action movies after two years and there's a small cameo of him flipping off two charactersit's obvious but I won't tell you the title. Here in Real Steel Jackman is energetic and somewhat perfect for the role. Dakota Goyo is a bit charming. Chemistry of him and Jackman shines through the film. It's fun to watch them together.There aren't much new here in Real Steel but in the end it's enjoyable and has plenty of heart. The climax isn't so much overwhelming but it intends to be more heartfelt. Again it's like Over The Top which the father is trying to make his son proud and Rocky because it's boxing and add some robots in it. Even without thinking much about the robots there is always human heart in this film. Hugh Jackman does it again. The underdog fighting movie genre does it again. It's really a fun film for the whole family.".

I immediately took it off my viewing schedule. Then the reviews came out and even Entertainment Weekly gave it an excellent review saying that it is actually way better than you would expect.

Forced to spend a summer with this kid they realize they bond over boxing robots. Robots mind you that seem to FEEL something when they are hit like c'mon....With an absolutely juvenile script that is just as much pieced together from every clich family movie just as some of these robots are pieced together with junk Real Steel is nothing more than a hightech Lifetime movie with one of the most preposterous scripts of the year. Every line is meant to tug at your heartstrings and make you feel fuzzy inside when it's not trying to impress you with its mediocre visual effects. It's tries to be nothing but cute from start to finish so saccharine that it quickly ends up nauseating.Right down to the kid using shadow technology to make his robot do some silly hip hop dance moves. Like really? What person over the age of twelve enjoyed this film? Real Steel is nothing more than a scrap yard of emotional manipulation that really has no redeeming qualities for any adult.

What I got was vomit inducing sentimentality characters that were either borderline parodies of themselves or entirely unbelievable and a storyline that left a lot to be desired. In addition the science required a suspension of disbelieve that was beyond me. I mean fighting robots that operate via voice recognition or even more laughably in shadow mode where they simply copy what they see. Where's the immersive VR suites with biofeedback? That would have been a lot more believable. Fighters controlling their robots via the web from the comfort of their homes. It wouldn't have taken a lot to make this aspect of the film a lot more believable. Also it was set too near in the future. By the time we have robots as advanced as these we won't be filling up trucks with fossil fuels something I noticed happening more than once  sponsorship from big oil?In its defence the kid actor was pretty good insofar as he could be with the sh1t script he's been given and the idea that kids would speak Japanese in the future due to the superiority of their online games was a nice touch though I think Chinese is just as likely.All in all a huge disappointment. I left the cinema after the final showdown about 510 minutes before the film ended when I just couldn't take any more of the attempted tear jerking. My friend left after an hour and preferred to sit outside playing on his phone until the film ended. An 11 year old might like this. Any adult with a normal IQ will not.Oh and watch out for the prolonged Budweiser product placement at the beginning of the film. Considering this is a kids film I thought that was a little bit naughty!".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's ignore for the minute the fact that this film was pretty much critic proof  it really didn't matter what was said when it released those that saw the trailer and thought two please were going to be there no matter what to see robots hitting each other. I apologise if that sounds snobby but I don't mean it that way because in fairness although I waited for the DVD I still came to the film prepared to leave my brain at the door and enjoy some familyfriendly sports action. Sadly I wasn't quite prepared for how lowlevel the vast majority of the film is.I'll deal with my personal problem with it first  the sports side simply isn't exciting. I say that as someone who gets weepy very easily when it comes to sports movies  the underdog coming good to defeat the champ while the music swells thing pretty much always has me pretending that I need to blow my nose in another room for the next 5 minutes but yet here? Nothing. The final fight is reasonably good and at least doesn't totally overdo it but I never felt into the fights never felt the drama of the or got lost in them as a spectator. And again at the risk of repeating myself I say that as someone who was on the edge of my seat during the main fight of Rocky 6. Real Steel doesn't really deliver in this realm and it is a real shame because that is an easy string to pull for the audience.Part of the reason it doesn't work is the fact that it is all special effects. They are very good effects but they are still special effects and I found myself watching it with a bemused curiosity like I did when Robot Wars used to be on BBC2 on a Friday evening. Indeed that is how it was for me  just bemusement rather than investment because the things are not real and never even felt close to being real. This isn't helped by the way the film is as predictable as it is clunky. The direction of the fight story from junk yard to title shot is as obvious as the emotional journey bad relationship to good one and the writers seem to have struggled to raise their energy for such a predictable trudge because the dialogue is corny as hell and clunks around the screen more than the robots do. The cast do what they can and I did feel for Jackman working his heart out but even he struggled to make it work.Of course working with Goyo he was always in a tough spot because this kid is annoying from start to finish. It doesn't help that Goyo is given dialogue that doesn't suit his character but also he spends most of the film being an ass just like Jackman has to do so after a while you realise that while you know where these characters are going you don't actually like them very much for a big section of the movie. Lilly looks cute not much else while Mackie gets a nice pay day for doing nothing much.The sequel will come of course and it will be more of the same because it will sell like this one did however it is hard to not be disappointed with it. OK it is for kids but why does that excuse it from being a good film? The sports action is noisy but heartless and everything else about it is clunky and predictable the effects look good and technically it is impressive but it just never gets going and it always feels like the producers decided that the concept and the effects would get people in the door so as long as they deliver on the concept robots hitting each other then there is no real need to worry the details details like character dialogue heart and general plotting. Average at best this.".

Even if you are on of the I didn't expect anything and so it was cool guys. It's really not worth your time. If I had not promised to watch this movie with a friend I would have gotten out after 30 minutes max not being any curious what would have happened next.Only nice thing were the animations. Real good work. Soundtrack was really crappy by the way.So 2 stars for the good acting of a real bad story and 1 for the animation.".

	schema:headline " Real Steel is the Real Deal";
	schema:reviewBody "Real Steel is awesome. I did not expect this going in. It is more than just Transformers meets Rocky doing rockum sockum robots. I saw Hugh Jackman on Jimmy Fallon talk about what made him enroll in the project. Real Steel beyond the visually astounding CGI glitz and spectacle is the touching story of father and son defining love and respect. Again not all that surprising given Steven Spielberg is Executive Producer. I'm a fan of Jackman. Real Steel may be his crossover hit that leverages his amazing gifts playing a real guy and not a superhero. He is awesome as well. As Jackman describes Real Steel is about second chances and redemption. Sure the story's climax pits underdog undersized fighting robot Atom against the ferocious indestructible Zeus. For me Real Steel resonates in its human voice. Hugh Jackman as Charlie confesses to his son Max scene stealing Dakota Goyo You deserve better than me. Charlie asks Max what he wants from him. Max answers I want you to fight for me! Yes Real Steel is fighting for love with everything you have. Real Steel is the real deal.Set in the near future 2020 human boxing is now obsolete. Robot boxing is the reigning form of entertainment that gives audiences the brutal carnage without damage to human life. Jackman is Charlie Kenton former boxer now manager of second rate robot boxers. As Real Steel opens we witness his robot Ambush being demolished at amusement event at a county rodeo. The promoter Ricky arrogant and sleazy Kevin Durand knows Charlie from his boxing days. It turns out that Charlie owes some bad people a lot of money. Charlie returns home to his love Bailey beautiful and radiant Evangeline Lilly with Ambush in tow. Bailey confirms that Ambush is a complete loss and reminds Charlie that he has no money. Bailey owns her father's boxing gym in the city and her father managed and trained Charlie when he was a contender. Bailey can't support Charlie and keep the gym afloat.Charlie gets word that his old girlfriend died and he now has custody of their son Max Goyo. Irresponsible Charlie pretty much abandoned Max and his Mom when he was born. Max is 11 years old. Max's Aunt Debra unforgiving and taut Hope Davis wants full custody of Max. At a court hearing in Texas loutish Charlie expresses no interest in being a father. Instead he brokers a deal with Debra's wealthy husband Marvin decent James Rebhorn to sign custody away for 100000. Charlie needs the money to buy state of the art champion robot Noisy Boy. The catch Debra and Marvin are vacationing in Italy for 2 months. So Charlie gets to forge a relationship with Max or not. Really for Charlie this means having Bailey look after Max. Goyo is natural as the smart cool gamer kid who is a fan of robot boxing and street dancing. Seems he also inherits his Dad's stubbornness. He also insists on calling Jackman Charlie. Max knows he is being played at least initially.Evangeline Lilly is beautifully understated and generative as Bailey. Too bad she isn't given more to do as well. She immediately is drawn to care for Max because he is like Charlie but void of his painful disappointments. In a wonderful scene she tells Max about the man Charlie was as a boxer. Although he was 25 and 19 unfortunately all by knockout he battled toetotoe with the number 2 contender in the world. Her Bailey loves Charlie so much and is waiting for him to step into the great man he can be. Jackman shades Charlie as a powerful man who lives life fully leaving nothing behind. Of course the glaring paradox is his relationship with Max. Screen and story writers John Gatins Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven strike the right tone with their Real Steel they know it's the people that inspire not the stunning special effects. Director Levy touchingly focuses his narrative as well.Charlie's Noisy Boy is torn to shreds in an underground cage match. While searching for repair parts in the junkyard Max uncovers another robot Atom. Atom is a second generation sparring bot as Charlie points out to Max. So Atom is built to take punishment not inflict it. Unfazed Max is determined to fight Atom in matches. Using his hacker skills Max merges Noisy Boy's voice command feature with Atom's Shadow FunctionAtom can flawlessly imitate every movement he sees. Charlie trains Atom giving the robot the punching combinations and instincts of a human boxer. Charlie and Max leverage this advantage over other fighting bots and soon find themselves fighting in the WRB World Robot Boxing. The reigning WRB Champion is Zeus technological marvel designed by creator Tak Mashido elegantly arrogant Karl Yune. Zeus is programmed with artificial intelligence that learns from his opponents and evolves. Zeus's owner is the gorgeous and canny Farra Lemkova well played by Olga Fonda. Human instinct and courage is matched against calculated advanced technology. This is Charlie's last shot at greatness and his chance to come to terms with his past.In Real Steel Sugar Ray Leonard trained Hugh Jackman to box and was the technical adviser for robot boxing in the ring. Jackman looks quick strong and lean. Too bad none of his boxer action sequences made it into the final cut. All this gives Real Steel a visceral authenticity. The real deal is Jackman and Goyo's heartfelt chemistry. Yes that they become father and son is predictable. It's supposed to. Jackman is powerful and compassionate as he believably transforms into the hero. Goyo is wonderful as the innocent kid who just wants to believe in something. In a poignant scene with both as Charlie fails to protect Max he whispers I'm sorry Real Steel at times is shamelessly hokey and I loved it. In the end it is about love and all that you fight for. Real Steel gets it right.".

Hudson gets an offer from Emperor Maximilian of Mexico to bring his people and resettle there. He needs all the help he can get to prop up his unpopular government. Hudson is certainly bringing a better quality of Anglo than Burt Lancaster did in Vera Cruz.When Wayne feels a rip off coming from some middlemen horsetraders he settles it in the usual Duke fashion and heads to Mexico himself. There the parties of Wayne and Hudson meet and their stories are entwined from then on.With Wayne and Hudson costarring The Undefeated was led by two men who between them were number one at the box office for about a dozen years combined. Wayne was coming off his Oscar winning performance in True Grit. This film was definitely guaranteed an audience.The story is both men are decent fellows and born leaders. Each is trying to pick up the pieces of civilian life and each is the leader of a party looking to them for leadership. A healthy and mutual respect develops between them despite previous political differences.Wayne gets a whole load of players who worked with him before for this part. As he grew older he liked to have familiar faces around him. He had the star clout to insure it as well. Ben Johnson Bruce Cabot Edward Faulkner Harry Carey Jr. are some of the Wayne film veterans here. Dub Taylor in his only film with the Duke does a very entertaining job as McCartney the cook. Dub did so many westerns when he wasn't doing hillbillies it's amazing that his and Wayne's path crossed only once.This was also an early film for Jan Michael Vincent who went on to a star career of his own. Two members of the Los Angeles Rams Roman Gabriel and Merlin Olsen were in this as well. Gabriel played a surrogate son to Wayne and rival for the hand of Melissa Newman to Vincent. Merlin Olsen is also here as a Confederate aide to Hudson. Gabriel decided movies wasn't his thing but Olsen certainly had a substantial career after football.The Undefeated has a nice easy and charming flow to it just like The Comancheros. Wayne and Hudson work well together in their only joint outing. Less action than you normally have in a Wayne film but it's mixed in well with some good comic moments.As Duke said parodying one of his one lines from a previous hit film of his Let's Take 'Em to Mexico.

There are very few unlikeable parts to this movie. That's not to say it's outrageously good some of the supporting cast look amateurish at times and the music occasionally stifles the action on screen but aside from that it's fine. John Wayne and Rock Hudson were two of those rare actor types who can't put in a bad performance if they try but I don't think I need to tell you that.It's a good package. Perfect for evening viewing I'd recommend as I just spent a very profitable evening in front of it. Some short but sweet action scenes some just plain sweet romance subplots and a good and happy ending makes for one satisfied viewer. Far from perfect but great all the same.   ".

	schema:reviewBody "The Undefeated 1969 teams up John Wayne and Rock Hudson as exUnion and Confederate officers after the Civil War in Mexico. Langdon Hudson wants to relocate his family  friends whereas Thomas Wayne wants to make money selling horses to Emperor Maximilian. The problem is that Benito Juarez and his followers are at war with Maximilian and this causes unforeseen problems for the Americans who have no choice but to teamup.The setup of story is great and loosely based on Joseph Orville Jo Shelby and his Missouri raiders and their families who really did seek to relocate to Maximilian's Mexico but had to return after the victory of Juarez' forces. The movie starts with a Civil War battle and the announcement that Lee has surrendered and the war is over which segues into Langdon and Thomas and their people going to Mexico for completely different reasons and then they meet. This is great but the filmmakers add some goofiness like an overthetop funspirited brawl between the Confederates and Federals at a 4th of July party in the wilderness. These types of scenes were fairly common in Wayne Westerns at the time and I always thought they detracted from these movies. There's a way to mix realistic comedy into a movie and a way not to and this isn't the way. Besides how can a serious brouhaha be fun? When you punch people in the face in real life they get bloody noses and missing teeth here they just laugh it off.Another problem is NFL quarterback Roman Gabriel as a fullblooded Native American and adopted son of Thomas. No matter how you slice it he looks like a white dude with a mop of black hair. To add insult to injury Langdon's cute daughter Melissa Newman falls headoverheals in love with him and the way it happens simply isn't realistic. Would a genuine Southern belle really swoon over a fullblooded Indian who visits their encampment? Would no one notice that the two have wandered off to makeout in plain view of the others? Would Col. Langdon really not mind that his daughter is sucking face with a fullblooded Native? In our day and age it's no big deal and most people could care less but it's still an issue in some circles how much more so back then particularly with a proud Southern Colonel and his people? If you can overlook these flaws however this is a very worthwhile Western with quality drama action characters and locations shot in Baton Rouge Louisiana and Durango Mexico. The cast is also notable. Besides the two stars you also get Lee Meriwether Marian McCargo JanMichael Vincent in a toosmall role Merlin Olsen Ben Johnson and various Wayne Western staples.This is a likable Western because the people are so likable. For instance the way one group is unselfishly willing to let go of something of great worth on behalf of another group blows the mind but it reveals their nobility and the fact that they value human beings more than they do monetary gain but only because they've found them worthy. It also reveals respect and the willingness to forgive  heal after the nation's most bloody war.The film runs 119 minutes.GRADE B".

It stars John Wayne  Rock Hudson features a musical score by Hugo Montenegro and William H. Clothier provides the South Western cinematography.Much yeehawing and lots of patriotic fervour The Undefeated is a fun and undemanding way for the Western fan to spend a couple of hours. Plot basically revolves around some post Civil War rivalries between Union and Confederate leaders played by Wayne and Hudson respectively. Both men and the groups they have under their control get mixed up in the MaximillianJuarez revolution in Mexico. Cue moral quandaries big decisions and life affirming human interests as McLaglen aided by Wayne apparently directs unfussy without pushing the envelope of Western directing. True enough at times the tone is uneven it's hard to tell if it's meant to be light hearted or serious during some passages kind of why John Ford was a genre master since he could achieve it comfortably and some casting decisions are rather baffling hello Roman Gabriel but it's all very spirited especially Hudson to round it out as a solid genre offering from the late 1960s. 6.510".

Clothier provides the South Western cinematography.Much yeehawing and lots of patriotic fervour The Undefeated is a fun and undemanding way for the Western fan to spend a couple of hours. Plot basically revolves around some post Civil War rivalries between Union and Confederate leaders played by Wayne and Hudson respectively. Both men and the groups they have under their control get mixed up in the MaximillianJuarez revolution in Mexico. Cue moral quandaries big decisions and life affirming human interests as McLaglen aided by Wayne apparently directs unfussy without pushing the envelope of Western directing. True enough at times the tone is uneven it's hard to tell if it's meant to be light hearted or serious during some passages kind of why John Ford was a genre master since he could achieve it comfortably and some casting decisions are rather baffling hello Roman Gabriel but it's all very spirited especially Hudson to round it out as a solid genre offering from the late 1960s. 6.510";

	schema:headline " Underrated and watchable western with some originality.";
	schema:reviewBody "Saw this film around 30 years ago. At that time I thought it just a fairly formulaic star vehicle bringing together the grizzled typical Wayne cowboy character with someone who was a newer and  at the time a really big name in Rock Hudson. Seeing it anew in 2007 I realise my earlier estimate was too dismissive by far. It has a good plot with many original aspects well described already on the website by earlier reviewers especially the linkage of US civil war with events happening at the same time in Mexico. Not being a huge fan ordinarily of either of the main stars it has to be said they both turn in good performances and are fully believable as leaders whom other men would naturally follow and who inspire fierce loyalties. The dialogue has a few unexpectedly good lines and is generally above average standard. The stars play it lightheartedly and this gives the film warmth colour and humour. Some aspects of the film admittedly conform to the hackneyed Wayne cowboy film recipe such as the freeforall fist fight but in general the film stands up well nearly 40 years after it was made and it has held on to a much more modern feel than other Wayne westerns. The musical score just about carries enough grandeur to match the action and the occasionally majestic cinematography especially the scenes involving the drive across country of a few thousand horses. Any filmlover who enjoys the more upmarket western should give this film a try. The nearly two hours pass quickly and it's a film to make you think about the nature of war against your fellow countrymen about loyalty friendship and heroism and escapist enough to make you smile.".

	schema:reviewBody "The title of The Undefeated refers to those Confederates who refused to accept defeat in the American Civil War and migrated to Mexico rather than live under the Union. The film is loosely based on a true story although the details are very much fictionalised. A group of Confederate soldiers led by Colonel James Langdon make their way with their families across Texas hoping to cross the Rio Grande and to join Emperor Maximilian of Mexico who has offered them land where they can make a new life. Langdon was once a wealthy plantation owner but has been ruined financially by the war and before leaving sets fire to his mansion rather than see it fall into the hands of Northerners.On the journey Langdon meets an old Civil War antagonist Colonel John Henry Thomas who is leading a group of his former soldiers on an expedition to capture a herd of wild horses which he is hoping to sell to the US government. Upon learning however that the Mexican government are willing to pay a better price Thomas and his men also turn south with their captive herd. The film tells the story of what happens when the two groups of Americans former enemies are forced to work together to fight off attacks from bandits and from the Juaristas republican opponents of Maximilian's government.A number of Westerns from this period had a Mexicanrelated theme and generally involve Americans becoming embroiled in either the Mexican civil war of the 1860s or the Mexican Revolution of the 1910s others include The Wild Bunch Two Mules for Sister Sara and The Professionals with Veracruz being an earlier example from the fifties. The makers of The Undefeated however were less concerned with the intricacies of Mexican politics than they were with putting across a message of American patriotism. Although the Confederates and Unionists have recently been fighting one another they learn to respect one another and to unite against a common foe. Thomas and his men not only help the Confederates fight the bandits they also give up their horses to ransom them when they are being held hostage by a Juarista general.The old divisions North versus South blue versus grey abolitionists versus advocates of slavery no longer matter the reconciliation between the two groups takes place very symbolically at a Fourth of July party. What matters is that former Confederates and former Unionists are all now Americans united against the world. Even nonwhites are included a romance develops between Thomas's adopted Indian son Blue Boy and Langdon's daughter. The implied message for the Americans of 1969 is that they must learn to overcome their own divisions conservative versus liberal young versus old black versus white proVietnam war versus pacifists in a similar way.This message of inclusive patriotism would have been dear to the heart of one of the film's two big stars John Wayne who plays Thomas. The following year Wayne was to make another Western Rio Lobo about Northerners and Southerners learning to live together after the Civil War. It is a potentially interesting theme but not one which this film makes the most of. Rock Hudson's performance as a Southern gentleman has been criticised but for me he was not the problem with the film. I will leave comment on his accent to those who are more familiar with the dialects of the Deep South than I am but I found his portrayal of a proud and honourable aristocrat a convincing one. John Wayne however had already shown in The Green Berets the year before that he was really too old to go on playing a frontline soldier and he is no more credible here. The film also contains a few other implausible elements. There may have been men in the 1860s who would have had no objection to their daughter entering into a racially mixed marriage but I doubt if a diehard Confederate aristocrat like Langdon would have been one of them. The film ends with both Langdon and Thomas on surprisingly good terms with the Juarista General Rojas even though he has shown himself to be both ruthless and treacherous and has threatened to shoot the Confederates in cold blood if his ransom demands are not met. The film is also overlong and its pace particularly during the second half tends to flag.The late sixties and early seventies saw the last great hurrah of the Western before its decline in the late seventies and eighties but The Undefeated cannot compare in quality with some of the other offerings from the period such as The Wild Bunch or Wayne's other film from 1969 True Grit or even with Chisum another collaboration between Wayne and director Andrew V. McLaglen from the following year. It is marginally better than the nonWestern The Green Berets but to say that about a film is no very great praise. 510".

To set this theme against the backdrop of both the War of Secession War Between the States AND the Mexican Revolution makes The Undefeated all the more promising. Furthermore parallels to Vietnam make The Undefeated a downright profound story. Sadly Andrew V. McLaglen tepid direction and bland casting of the female characters makes The Undefeated an unfulfilled promise and soso effort.To understand the profundity of The Undefeated requires a crash course in the War of Secession. Though slavery was a major issue it was NOT the primary cause of hostilities. Revolutionary War debt was coming due and many states that remained with the union had not paid their debts. However states that joined the Confederacy HAD paid their debt and resented draconian tariffs on goods entering and leaving their harbors. Secession was recognized and accepted as it is a basic part of the Declaration of Independence and of the Congressional Record at the time of the enactment of the US Constitution. Even Lincoln as a member of Congress recognized the right of secession. For those who still insist the war was about slavery keep in mind four slave states remained in the union.It is time now to discuss the flawed world views of both union Colonel John Henry Thomas John Wayne and confederate Colonel James Langdon Rock Hudson. Thomas is a decent kind hearted man but his world view is quite callous. Thomas thinks nothing of taking his loyal men into strifetorn Mexico even though he knows they may be killed and that none of them has seen home for four years. Langdon is also decent and kind hearted but his vanity leads him to destroy his property and take his family into Mexico to fight alongside General Maximilian who is doing to the citizens of Mexico what the Union did to the Confederacy. BOTH men receive a deserved comeuppance from Juarista General Rojas Tony Aguilar. I am sure this would be lost on most American audiences even today even in the hands of a more skilled western director such as John Ford Howard Hawks Sergio Leone Anthony Mann Budd Boetticher Fred Zinnemann or even Henry Hathaway.The finest performances in The Undefeated come from Rock Hudson and Roman Gabriel. Unfortunately their samesex antics drew publicity which clearly eclipsed the movie. Other fine performances include the aforementioned Tony Aguilar whose reluctance and relief at a key moment is the best scene of the film Merlin Olsen as a wise man who prefers the company of children to adults Royal Dano who reveals the true theme of The Undefeated and Big John Hamilton who proves one does not have to fight a war or appear unafraid to be a hero.Hugo Montenegro who had a top 40 hit channeling Ennio Morricone with The Theme From 'The Good The Bad  The Ugly' here channels Elmer Bernstein with his music. While not great Bernstein Montenegro's score is at least good Bernstein.I give The Undefeated a 6.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like John Wayne regardless. he was a real good actor for war movies and for westerns like this one. The Undefeated is a nice postCivil War western with Wayne and Hudson as main stars and they both deliver excellent parts as a Union and a Confederate officers respectively. This is not any new story down in Mexico with all the bandits wild horses Mexican troops deserts shootouts women Indians cactuses dances and all. Nothing very new but this movie really works well and all 120 minutes it is a nice and fast sunny dry Mexican drama. Some phrases and dialog lines are very cool and deeply humorous too. Why 8 and not 10? As I wrote above rather predictable plot looks often like many Mexico border westerns so far. Often smacks of some other Wayne films but generally still a very enjoyable fast often hilarious movie full of action and events. Good for all western buffs and Civil war aficionados like me Recommended".

	schema:headline " Routine Western with John Wayne";
	schema:reviewBody "Wild Geese director Andrew V. McLaglen's The Undefeated marked a low point in John Wayne's cinematic career. James Lee Barrett's screenplay has an ending looks like something out of a John Huston heist caper because nobody wins in the end except the Mexican revolutionaries. Indeed The Undefeated looks like a reconciliation fable as former Union troops and their tenacious Confederate adversaries find common ground and help each other out. Furthermore the notion that each sideJohn Wayne's cowboys and Rock Hudson's unreconstructed rebelswould become friendly with each other seems improbable. After four years of fighting Johnny Rebs no Yankee bluecoat would change their attitudes so quickly. The optimistic protagonists behave like everything will magically work out for them. Hudson's rebels dream that they can find sanctuary in Mexico and fight alongside Emperor Maximilian to oust Benito Jurez and his revolutionaries. Again the lackluster ending where Wayne and company cavein to the demands of the revolutionaries just doesn't reasonable.This routine but polished postCivil War western opens with one final battle between the Blue and the Gray. No sooner have Colonel John Henry Thomas John Wayne of True Gritand his troops triumphed in battle than he discovers that the war had concluded three days previously with General Lee's surrender. As it turns out the Confederates already knew about Lee's historic surrender at Appomattox Court House and preferred to keep on fighting. This is about as realistic as The Undefeated gets because everything afterward defies logic and credibility. Later our hero in a tengallon hat changes his uniform for civilian clothes and several of his troops help him herd and sell horses for a living. Costarring with Wayne for his first and only time superstar Hollywood legend Rock Hudson plays a Confederate Colonel James Langdon. This proud southern plantation patriarch burns his mansion rather than hand it over to Yankee carpetbaggers. Langdon and his family and friends leave their home in Louisiana to head for Mexico to join the ranks of the Emperor Maximilian's army. They barely get Mexico soil beneath their hooves with a Federal patrol at their heels. Meantime John Henry learns that the Emperor is willing to pay more for his 3000 horses than the U.S. Army and he drives his horses to Mexico. Along the way Thomas' men run into Langdon's caravan and help them fend off marauders. The confrontation between Wayne and the villains is pretty good. The photography is splendid but the ending leaves much to be desired.".

This then is one from that professionally made solidly entertaining and unassuming bunch despite having been shown on TV several times over the years it is not one that I had been familiar with prior to this viewing.The third of five films the Duke would make with director Andrew V.McLaglen it is not the best but not the worst either actually it has a surprisingly good premise  in post Civil War days a band of Northerners led by Wayne naturally take to rustling horses and selling them to the highest bidder when that happens to be Emperor Maximilian of Mexico they take a hard ride down Mexico way which pits them against several odds the U.S. and the rebel Juaristasaiding French armies who both want to take possession of their herd as well as a proud group of Confederates led by a somewhat uncomfortable Rock Hudson who have been promised shelter from Maximilian himself. During the course of the journey tensions and friendships flare up as Waynes adopted Native American son falls for Hudsons daughter and both parties engage in a freeforall drunken fistfight a prerequisite John Wayne movie ingredient especially at this stage in his career to celebrate the 4th of July. However when Hudson and his men reach Maximilian territory they are abducted by the Juaristas who demand the exchange of Waynes horses for the Southerners lives. Will they comply? The immediate postCivil War backdrop provides James Lee Barretts script with something to say about tolerance and patriotism the rugged largerthanlife action is set in sprawling locations Louisiana and Durango Mexico expertly lighted by frequent Wayne cinematographer William H. Clothier and set to an appropriately grandiose Hugo Montenegro score. The film running a longish 118 minutes loses some momentum in the second half and the romanticyouthful interest here is a particular liability  but this is countered by some good quips delivered in Waynes typically dry fashion especially his classic excuse to shooting a bandit he was supposed to just have a talk with The conversation kinda dried up maam! Of course it would not be a John Wayne movie if it did not have the benefit of a number of reliable character actors featured in the cast and here we have a pretty colorful one too Ben Johnson Bruce Cabot Harry Carey Jr. Paul Fix Royal Dano John Agar Dub Taylor and Pedro Armendariz Jr prominent supporting roles are also offered to a very young JanMichael Vincent and two professional American football stars Roman Gabriel and Merlin Olsen. Interestingly enough Hudsons role was originally intended for another of Waynes stock company of character actors James Arness again Wayne was injured during the making of the film forcing the director to shoot him from a limited number of angles but he ahem soldiered on because he felt he owed his fans a good show!".

Maybe not all those things in the obvious sense but as kids it made us feel sad about war disgusted at the prejudice and fall in love with the handsome native American Blue Boy.

	schema:reviewBody "Some of the reviews here are in sore need of a history lesson! First this movie is fine entertainment. And that was all that was really intended. However a few corrections to some other reviews are in order.1. Roman Gabriel's parents are of FilipinoAmerican descent from Wilmington North Carolina. Consequently him playing the role of a Cherokee son of a war chief out of Oklahoma territory isn't a farfetched piece of casting by any degree. In terms of it being unlikely for a young woman to be smitten by him let's just say Gabriel had that effect on a great number of women!2. The plot of the movie is based on actual events but of course a fictionalized version of them. In fact politically speaking the plot is quite realistic in showing the complex web of Mexican political struggle between the Austrian emperor Maximilian and Benito Juarez. Among the many serious moments of the film are presentations of the dire civil war between the Juareztas and Maximilians.3. Perhaps the most questionable from a period moral standpoint was the willingness of the protagonist to sell 3000 prime horses to Maximilian. Doing so was in violation of the spirit of the Monroe Doctrine as well as a set of decrees by President Andrew Johnson in support of Juarez as well as a secret supply effort carried out by General Phil Sheridan who according to his private memoirs provided weapons and ammunition to Juaresta forces which we left at convenient places on our side of the river to fall into their hands.4. Left unstated is the morally repugnant reality of former Confederates emigrating to Mexico to ally with Maximilian. Their intention was to set up fiefdoms inside Mexico. Maximilian's defeat ultimately prevented Mexico from becoming a European colony on America's border.By going just deep enough into the political issues the movie strikes a balance of good entertainment with drama.".

	schema:headline " Spectacular Cinematography Lifts Uneven Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Set in the period just after the Civil War The Undefeated pits exUnion officer John Wayne against exConfederate officer Rock Hudson in an amiable if uneven bigbudget western. Hudson as Colonel James Langdon leaves his ancestral home after the defeat of the Confederacy and leads his family and friends southwards on a trek to find a new home in Emperor Maximilian's Mexico. Meanwhile Colonel John Henry Thomas played by Wayne gathers his exarmy buddies and endeavors to round up and sell horses to the U.S. Army. The two men and their followers meet up in Northern Mexico and find themselves embroiled in the struggle between Frenchbacked supporters of Maximilian and Mexican nationalists who back Benito Juarez. The resulting film directed by Andrew V. McLaglen is a predictable western with enough action and friendly verbal sparring between the former battlefield enemies to entertain for the twohour running time.Besides Wayne and Hudson the cast benefits from such veteran western stalwarts as Bruce Cabot Ben Johnson Paul Fix Harry Carey Jr. John Agar and Dub Taylor. However the film's most outstanding assets are a fine musical score by Hugo Montenegro and exceptional cinematography by William H. Clothier Clothier captures sweeping vistas of northern Mexico a herd of galloping horses mounted cavalry advancing across battlefields and horsedrawn wagons fording a river that enhance the visual spectacle of The Undefeated. Unfortunately the film falters during a silly mass fist fight between the Northerners and Southerners and the anachronistic romance between a Native American scout and Langdon's daughter creates a time warp the pairing of a Southern white woman with a Native American in the days after the fall of the Confederacy is pure fantasy. Well coiffed and madeup ladies in formal French gowns dining on makeshift tables outside their covered wagons is also a stretch of credibility no dust or grime intrudes on their frontier life. The friendly bonding between the former adversaries Langdon and Thomas and their followers is equally unlikely and although Wayne and Hudson make strange bedfellows they work well together. While not among the landmark westerns of Wayne's career The Undefeated elevated by Clothier's outstanding cinematography Montenegro's score and a supporting cast of familiar western faces is solid entertainment and well worth discovering or rediscovering.".

Certain elements of this such as the hairstyles are very much a product of the era in which this was made rather than historical accuracy. It reminds me of Bonanza in the '70s when Little Joe had long bushy sideburns because actor Michael Landon cared more about his personal style than that of his character. The curiosity factor of seeing Duke and Rock in a movie together might make it worth seeing for some. Really though it's pretty dull. The direction is pedestrian and uninteresting.

Good storyvery well made exciting action and good performances all around. People always play down John Wayne as always wearing the same clothes and gun and even riding the same horse. In my opinion Wayne was a fine entertainer and a good actor. Don't try to compare him with the Oliviers and Burtons in the business. Also the same with Rock Hudson.I never saw a bad performance from him either. As usual in a Wayne picture you had some of his usual crew working with him such as Ben Johnson Richard Donner and Bruce Cabot. Also notice a very young Jan Michael Vincent.

Thomas' ending remark was how she was happy living in Philadelphia giving piano lessons.... Another interesting sidelight the actor playing Gen.

Wayne is well served by his stock company of western actors that he used in many of his later Westerns. You will see many of the same actors used in Chisum Rio Lobo Big Jake and Cahill US Marshall.

Thomas responds to his Southern counterpart Not like Philadelphia which was the name of Temple's character. When Langdon seeks clarification Thomas says never mind. Any insight into that exchange would be appreciated.Following the film's progress for two hours the ending comes as a bit of a letdown as one expects the alliance between the Union and Confederate Colonels to lead a final charge against the Juarista General Rojas Antonio Aguilar who holds the members of Langdon's wagon train hostage in exchange for Colonel Thomas' horses. Instead Thomas agrees to the terms presumably to insure a fight for another day and another movie.".

But honestly this film made me think  in all the ways that school should have and the DPSociety didn't even try to.Robin Williams has never starred in a thinking man's film which is why in the end the comparison between the two movies doesn't hold up.  To get The Emperor's Club you have to actually grasp why someone might be inspired by history  by a time when men could truly fail or conquer or establish a foothold in eternity.  The fact that we know Socrates existed is astounding. It is luck.  If James Carville goes down in history it will be an accident if a likely one.  The point of this film is that difference  the difference between men whose character demands to be remembered and men whose character demands to be forgotten.  It is also the story of two systems of reward and recognition  one that produced Plato and one that produced Jerry Springer.  That is why we study history as the movie says. To learn from and be inspired by the great leaders who came before us and to overcome the moral mediocrity of the modern world.But as the film concludes great men are no longer chosen to lead.  The Emperor's Club while cloaked in the guise of a charming elitist flick is actually a tale of profound disappointment and disillusionment regarding human society.  The few great men who are left exist in the shadows while the ignorant grandstanders wield political power.  We elect them we are in their hands.  And it is all because of a lack of awareness a lack of knowledge and a lack of history.  People don't vote for principle  they vote for rhetoric.  And it shows.I was not expecting too much from this movie other than the always pleasurable experience of watching Kevin Kline.  But wrapped up in the sentimental moralizing there was the story of a great man doing the only great thing left trying to bring others out the darkness.

This is a show with virtually no violence and very littleif anysexual content and the majority of the cast are either rising young stars who haven't quite reached high acclaim yet or are older character actorsso one will enter this on virtually a blindfaith interest of the film's topic ormore likelyan appreciation for Mr.Kline. To be honest and tell on myselfwhen this film was out I passed it up and didn't really sit down to appreciate it until very recentlyand that was a a free library rental! As isfree or notthis is clearly a unique and recommendable movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps teacher movies should be judged on their own merits but it's human nature to compare. Although I also love Dead Poet's Society I consider The Emperor's Club one of the most compelling movies I have ever seen. The two are actually worlds apart with Emperor's Club definitely a more cerebral film. Dead Poets seems more student oriented students shun conformity as a result of teacher impact and Emperor's Club more teacher focused teacher struggles to inspire challenging student and is faced with difficult choices. Also they have very distinct themes with Dead Poets focusing more on individuality and 'seizing the day' while Emperor's Club revolves around character and ethics. Unlike Dead Poets and also Mona Lisa Smile the Emperor's Club teacher has no controversial subject matter or approaches just relatively traditional though passionate  effective teaching methods.The story depicts Mr. Hundert a highly respected and idealistic Classics professor at an ivy covered prestigious boys' prep school St. Benedict's. He tries to impart a passion for Greek  Roman history to his relatively motivated students while also conveying the importance of principles and contribution to society. All passes smoothly until the arrival of Sedgewick Bell the obnoxious and rebellious son of a slimy Senator who neglects his 'nuisance' offspring and exhibits an unfortunate tendency to profanity. A battle of wills ensues between teacher and student as Sedgewick not only disrupts the class himself but inspires rowdy disrespect among his classmates. Mr. Hundert sees the vast potential in this antagonistic student and makes every effort to motivate Sedgewick to apply himself to his studies and also to exhibit personal integrity. In the process Mr. Hundert himself a dedicated teacher with great integrity neglects his other students to focus on the one. He illegitimately enables Sedgewick to participate as a finalist in the school's annual Mr. Julius Caesar Contest secretly passing over the truly deserving student Martin Blythe. A reunion 25 years later will depict the impact of this teacher's flawed choices on his former student's character and whether or not past injustices can finally be righted.I don't want to give the outcome away but this reunion provides a fascinating portrait of Mr. Hundert's students as grown men. We can examine the world's view of their success versus our own witnessing their career choices their wives  families and especially their character traits...whether contributory and noble or self absorbed and dishonourable. Compelling glimpses of two of these student's offspring Robert Bell and Martin Blythe IV prove to be incredibly revealing.Kevin Kline an under rated actor is masterfully convincing in the role of the scholarly dignified and conflicted Mr. Hundert and his 25 year aging process seems well depicted. Also the roles of the boys Martin Louis Deepak and of course the unpleasant Sedgewick are all well cast as well as their older versions.This is not simply another great film about an extraordinary teacher who has a profound impact upon his students. What distinguishes this movie from the rest is that Mr. Hundert though a wonderfully dedicated and moral teacher is himself flawed and compromises his own principles. In some respects this actually makes him a much more three dimensional realistic and compelling character than such previous exemplary teachers as Mr. Chips Good Bye Mr. Chips Mr. Keating Dead Poets Society and Mr. Holland Mr. Holland's Opus. The theme here revolves not only around Mr. Hundert's impact on the boys but also his inner conflict actually more significant than any external struggle with the rabble rousing Sedgewick or the misguided system that focuses more on fund raising than academic excellence. The film makes the point that sometimes the moral choice is not always clear cut that crossing an unethical boundary can appear all too justifiable and that one unprincipled decision may lead to another. There is a subtly conveyed sense as to the extent that Mr. Hundert's unethical decisions have haunted him during the intervening decades and possibly even affected his subsequent career path as he is passed over for the Headmaster's position and begins to question his own value as an educator. The little sub plot is actually quite engaging not irrelevant as some claim that portrays the potential romance between Mr. Hundert and Elizabeth a lovely but married fellow teacher. Its purpose is to give another indication of Mr. Hundert's character and integrity this time revealed through his personal life. Although these two are obviously close kindred spirits with a mutual attraction he makes no attempt to move beyond platonic friendship. His emotional but restrained response is well conveyed when Elizabeth announces that she is moving to England with her husband who has obtained a position at Oxford.Personally I found all the Greek  Roman History class scenes quite engaging and enjoyed the competition with its trio of toga clad contestants. It all made me wish I was a student myself in Mr. Hundert's Classics class surrounded by all those busts of Cicero Socrates Plato and Caesar.The Emperor's Club is a unique intelligent and thought provoking film that contrasts society's misguided values with the truly meaningful and important. Very few movies today deal with ethical issues but this one explores such moral matters as teacher favouritism bending the rules and cheating. It prompts discussion encouraging the viewer to question his own views of right and wrong in these situations. The movie also challenges our thinking as to exactly what does constitute teacher success as we watch Mr Hundert come to grips with his own personal definition. The quiet ending may be less intense and dramatic than Dead Poets Society but is equally moving and powerful. As a former teacher myself my hat goes off to Mr. Hundert. Although very human and with some lessons to learn himself this dedicated teacher serves as an inspirational role model for viewers of this film as well as for his students.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Emperor's Club is a lot different than you would think. It does run a bit on cheesy sentimentality but the ending is more than surprising considering the type of film this is.It is a periodpiece about a teacher Kevin Kline at a prestigious school for boys and how he tries to mould a strongwilled fifteenyearold boy. And if you want a hint at the surprise ending don't read any farther because I cannot control telling you that in the end he does not change the boy. Which is what truly amazed me. Most of the time in films like these we see the freespirited kid become proper and respectful. But not so here. This tale doesn't have a perfect teacher turning a bad boy into a perfect boy. It has a flawed teacher wasting years on one student. Years later at a party he tells the boy Sedgewick now an adult as a teacher I have failed you. And that's what is so very different about this movie. It isn't as heavy on the drama as I thought it would be and comes across a bit cheesy and fluffy at times but the ending is more surprising than The Sixth Sense ever will be. It doesn't rely on triedandused methods but goes for a new route. And just when you think that it's as depressing as it can get the very very end gives your spirit a bit of a boost.Kline realizes that in those years that Sedgewick attended his class he ignored the other students who were trying  and actually cared  about what they were doing. It kind of sheds a new light on the films where a teacher devotes time to one student in particular because after seeing this film I bet ten bucks next time you watch a film of the same roots you'll realize that the teacher is ignoring the other students. And The Emperor's Club exposes this. Kline's character is flawed and while he is a good teacher he makes mistakes such as spending so much time on Sedgewick and bumping a smarter kid off of the school toga challenge just so he can put Sedgewick in it the challenge.Kevin Kline isn't Otto here. Ahole! is not a motto here. We've got Kline giving a thoroughly convincing performance as a 1970s allboys school teacher. Kline's makeup at the end of the film is quite good as well as opposed to something like The Dish where Sam Neil's makeup looks like it's about to fall off his face and his wig is about to be plucked off by a gust of wind.I also liked the student actors in this film. The actors they got to play the various students were pretty good in fact many of them were very good. I hope their careers continue after this film and as hateable as Sedgewick was in this film the kid who played him was pretty convincing. You always know this when you start to like or dislike a character much less hate or love them.At the end of the film I like the subtle differences in years. In the 1970s a group of boys travel across a lake to check out the allgirls school where nuns shoo them away. 28 years later as Kline's character walks towards his schoolroom we see boys and girls walking around. In 28 years society has changed and it's funny to wonder if that group of boys from the 1970s ever thought that in 28 years what they were paddling across a lake for would be right next to them.".

	schema:reviewBody "From Goodbye Mr. Chips' in the 1930's to Dead Poet's Society' in the 1980's the movies have had a longrunning love affair with inspirational sentimental stories set at ivycovered collegiategothic allmale prep schools.  These films inevitably center around a beloved teacher and the lifelong bond he forges with his devoted students.  The latest addition to the genre  a successful one  is The Emperor's Club' with Kevin Kline assuming the role of the teacher who considers it his duty not only to instruct his students in the details of classical history but to mold them into men of integrity and character in the process. The Emperor's Club' follows the standard formula up to a point.  William Hundert is the most highly respected faculty member at St. Benedict's Academy.  He is able to bring the history of the ancient Greeks and Romans to vivid life for his admittedly highly motivated young charges.  Then one day into his classroom strides Sedgwick Bell a bright highly unmotivated student who would rather mock the stuffiness of education and inspire his buddies to feats of rabblerousing than devote his life to the serious pursuit of academia.  It thus becomes Hundert's job to turn Sedgwick around a feat that always seems much easier to accomplish in the movies than it ever is in real life.The Emperor's Club' after its rather conventional beginning deviates from its predecessors in one key respect  Hundert though a man of values and integrity is not above compromise himself and he winds up making a very serious one the ramifications of which he has to live with for many years to come.  Rather than showing him as some sort of saintly figure screenwriter Neil Tolkin working from a short story by Ethan Canin and director Michael Hoffman allow Hundert's humanity to shine through.  He is a flawed individual who permits personal feelings to cloud his judgments and who is willing once he has created a problem to allow the truth of his own guilt to remain hidden even when innocent victims suffer as a result of his actions.  The Emperor's Club' is also notable for its cleareyed recognition that not all situations in life need have a satisfying resolution that some people simply do not acknowledge their own failings and therefore never develop into morally superior people no matter how many experiences life throws at them.  Yet what breaks Hundert's heart is the recognition he comes to that such a person is often times more highly rewarded by the world than the man who follows along the straightandnarrow path all his life.Kline gives a superb performance as Hundert capturing the quiet dignity understated passion and conflicted conscience of a man who loves his boys and who tries to do the right thing but who like the rest of us doesn't always succeed in doing so.  Emile Hirsch is also excellent as young Sedgwick the boy whose need for attention and lack of moral guidance from his father lead him to accept the winningatallcost philosophy to get him through life.The Emperor's Club' despite having its roots firmly planted in a grand storytelling tradition still manages to take us into new territory from time to time  and its recognition of the importance of education and academics we actually get to learn a little about Roman history while watching the movie makes it virtually unique among films of its time.".

	schema:reviewBody "A very significant film about a well respected teacher who tries to correct the ways of a spoiled rowdy kid in an all boys prep school. The film shows how the teacher is trying to change the son of a senator who does not spend anytime in his studies but focuses on girls and does a lot of schemes. And as Mr. Hundert does his best he believes he has changed him after he sees that he is improving on his studies and getting better grades and decides to put him on the annual Mr. Julius Caesar and every time he answers it looks as though he is thinking you know when you put your head down or cover your face and after that the gives the right one. But as he fails to answer the last question and looses Mr. Hundert finds out the truth Sedgewick has been cheating he has been using fake mannerisms and had sheets of the answers he copied from the books he borrowed from Mr. Hundert and 25 years later he wants a rematch and he brings a reunion which he seems to be using only to promote a campaign for him running as Senator. And once again he discovers that he is cheating using someone to tell him the answers via transmission. He tells him he fails and gives him a final lecture regarding his ways but Sedgewick disagrees. And at the end you see him all miserable leaving but all his student give him a big surprise. They give him a bat and thank him for everything he's done. He also comes to Martin Blythe who is said to have a legacy yeah his father won the Mr. Julius Caesar competition long ago tells him that it should have been him to be in the contest long ago instead of Sedgewick. Now as he continues teaching a new student who is late comes in and finds out he is the son of Martin and what does he do? He does what he did at the beginning. He tells him to stand at the back and read the plaque at the wall the sayings of Shutruk Nahunte. Overall this is a beautiful film with a beautiful message going out to all students and teachers all around to value studying and paying attention and class and to have eagerness take pride in it. I disagree very much to what some say to this film having the antiBush sentiments for there are more cheaters in this world outside politics and America. You are ignoring the 'real message' of this film just as Sedgewick is ignoring his studies as I said earlier this is about valuing our teachers and studies for you will never know that it will help you one day as you grow get a job get married and have kids you will use the virtues given to you and practice and preach what you've been taught. And to me some of it is a bit like the episode of The Twilight Zone Changing of the Guard about the professor who is resigned feels his life has been wasted then the ghosts of his students tell him he has more contribution and he taught them values that made them great people and war heroes and that his teachings were not in vain and his life has not been wasted. All hail The Emperor's Club I who is about to end recommends this to the whole family to students and teachers! Thank you Mr. Kline thank you Mr. Hoffman For an inspirational story though a bit clich convincing acting and stunning performances of Emile Hirsch Jesse Eisenberg Paul Dano and Rishi Mehta I grade this an A.".

	onyx:emotionText "A very significant film about a well respected teacher who tries to correct the ways of a spoiled rowdy kid in an all boys prep school. The film shows how the teacher is trying to change the son of a senator who does not spend anytime in his studies but focuses on girls and does a lot of schemes. And as Mr. Hundert does his best he believes he has changed him after he sees that he is improving on his studies and getting better grades and decides to put him on the annual Mr. Julius Caesar and every time he answers it looks as though he is thinking you know when you put your head down or cover your face and after that the gives the right one. But as he fails to answer the last question and looses Mr. Hundert finds out the truth Sedgewick has been cheating he has been using fake mannerisms and had sheets of the answers he copied from the books he borrowed from Mr. Hundert and 25 years later he wants a rematch and he brings a reunion which he seems to be using only to promote a campaign for him running as Senator. And once again he discovers that he is cheating using someone to tell him the answers via transmission. He tells him he fails and gives him a final lecture regarding his ways but Sedgewick disagrees. And at the end you see him all miserable leaving but all his student give him a big surprise. They give him a bat and thank him for everything he's done. He also comes to Martin Blythe who is said to have a legacy yeah his father won the Mr. Julius Caesar competition long ago tells him that it should have been him to be in the contest long ago instead of Sedgewick. Now as he continues teaching a new student who is late comes in and finds out he is the son of Martin and what does he do? He does what he did at the beginning. He tells him to stand at the back and read the plaque at the wall the sayings of Shutruk Nahunte.

And it wasis one of the most respected read pretentious in the country. I never learned one single thing that was actually of use to me and I believe going to such a place is mostly responsible for turning me into the faithless cynic that I am now.In this movie Kevin Kline a seriously underused actor plays a history teacher who is dedicated to making sure his students grow up to be fine and morally sound upstanding people. They all get along until Sedgewick Bell Emile Hirshthe hellraising son of an arrogant Governor arrives in class. His grades are terrible but Mr. Hundert sees intelligence in the boy and struggles to push him in the right direction at the expense of the rest of the class who actually want and care for education. Over the years he comes to regret his mistakes but sees a chance to put things right again with a reunion of all his former students organised by Sedgewick who appears to want to put things right.There are loads of StudentTeacher movies out there but what separates The Emperor's Club from the likes of Dead Poet's Society and Mr. Holland's Opus is that Mr. Hundert's teaching is never in doubt. But he is flawed. Kevin Kline is so good in the role that for most of the film I thought I was watching a real person and not a character. And doesn't he sound like Niles from Frasier? I do wish I went to somewhere like St. Benedicts or at least had a teacher like Mr. Hundert. It seems that teachers who really care only exist in the movies As are students who are willing to learn. Or perhaps it's just my bad noneducation that skews my opinion. Still I know good movies when I see one and The Emperor's Club get's my recommendation if you're sick of Hollywood massive budgets overblown SFX and intrusive marketing and just want a good character drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie deals with a good and idealist teacher Kevin Kline of Roman classic history and his relationship to a roguish and rebel pupil Emile Hirsch in a high class school . The teacher tries to redeem him but the continuous challenge makes that the incorrigible student besides  being senator's son  Harris Yulin results to be more and less difficult or impossible to dominate him . Meanwhile  the starring falls in love with an attractive  though married teacher Embeth Davidtz  and has problems with the college director Edward Herrmann.The picture is based on Ethan Canin's book titled  Palace thief . The story is narrated with sensitivity and intelligence and here are treated ethic and moral issues developed in great sense of ductility and fairness . As the teacher will have to face on the complex truth that can be manipulated or phony . The motion picture takes part of the School Subgenre  whose maxim representation turns out to be the prestigious Dead poet society by Peter Weir . The film is displayed throughout among past and present time where we find the same characters though twenty five years later  except Kevin Kline the actors are different . The actors' interpretation is excellent  such as Kevin Kline as a mature and upright teacher who hands perfectly the role  Emile Hirsch as the rascal young is topnotch as well as Embeth Davidtz who is wonderful and enjoyable . James Newton Howard's musical score is sensitive and touching . The story was well directed by Michael Hoffman . Rating  Above average  well worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like The Emperor's Club immensely! We get to see an excellent teacher Mr Hundert in trouble as forces lurking beyond his realm of experience Senator Bell  his son challenge his ethics and his methods of teaching to have him look in the mirror and question his own life and worth as an educator. In spite of Sedgewick Bell's influence on the other students we see that they do learn under Mr. Hundert having his efforts not be for naught! This is demonstrated via the education of Mr. Mehta if not the rest save Sedgewick Bell when we learn 25 years later that Mehta has become an educator himself and that he attributes Mr. Hundert's influence at least in part in that decision. However Hundert's method of trying to save Bell by using the unethical means of sacrificing Blythe's rightful position in the Mr. Julius Caesar competition in the final analysis losing Bell's soul to his father's methods anyway one questions the failed end justifying the means! In the end Blythe shows us his strength of character in his forgiveness of Mr. Hundert's ethical lapse big a deal as it would have been as a legacy with at least one former family Caesar recognizing his teacher's worth as we see him sending his own son to study under Hundert.Why people have to compare films of the same genre and choose one over another is beyond my comprehension. Both renditions of Goodbye Mr. Chips were excellent schmaltz and all portrayed by two remarkable actors. Dead Poet's Society was also a good film though in my opinion not on the scholarly par with The Emperor's Club. DPS brought out more of the psychologically fragile aspect of a human being the student while TEC brings out the scholarly aspect as well as to make us or keep us aware of some very unseemly personalities in the political arena and big business which have been corrupting and bankrupting our society for far too long. A subject of our time with so many recent examples and it seems to have no end. Harris Yulin as the arrogant Senator who seems to have a pact with the devil is excellent! To be arrogant and corrupt is bad enough but to corrupt one's own child by design is criminal and Yulin swings deliciously low for this role!Kudos to writer Ethan Canin for the original story and screenwriter Neil Tolkin for a beautifully developed screenplay. Gentlemen we need more stories like this one in today's world if we are to recognize and survive all the SELFABSOPTION ARROGANCE GREED and CORRUPTION that has taken over and become status quo. We also need more stories with positive characters such as are Blythe Mehta Masoudi Hundert etc. to uplift us and realize that all is not lost yet. We need to know about the unscrupulous types like the school's director well played by Edward Herrmann who only see  signs for new school wings and not the lack of integrity in allowing a cheating student not to be called on his compromise. Kevin Kline is in top form here! He ingests Hundert with a quiet though scholarly presence and a strong sense of knowing the past so that we are not doomed to repeat the mistakes of others. All cast should be extremely proud of their work on this project! The actors playing the young students didn't hit a sour note among them and it is chilling when young Blythe walks in at the end knowing whose son he is and that his parents have been incredible and positive role models we know his father has and assume that mom has as well. The actors playing the students 25 years later were likewise wonderful  in particular I like Steven Culp as Blythe with his noble intelligent ways and no corruption in him. Joel Gretsch as Bell has the right amount of good looks and charm coupled with his fatherfed dark side as does Emile Hirsch as young Bell. We have to wonder what is in store for Sedgewick Bell in his future relationship with his son Robert as Robert is witness to his father's corruption in the men's room scene. Mehta's humility and excellent student was almost stolen with mother's and then wife's beaming pride at each of the competitions. He is truly an inspired character. As for Patrick Dempsey is there any young actor in cinema today with more charm than he? He continues where the younger actor left off to ingest Masoudi with fun devilish charm and simple honesty! I highly recommend The Emperor's Club and wish more like it invaded our atmosphere and our part of the cosmos!".

You hope with Mr Hundert that somehow the die which has been cast will somehow be broken and Sedgewick will become a decent member of society. Sadly when it becomes obvious that he has grown into the monster that he was born to be you are shocked and saddened with Mr Hundert.In one of the final scenes Mr Hundert confronts Mr Bell and it leaves you with no doubt about who is greater man. What is salt for the wounds is that Mr Bell never had any shame about his pitiful morals.It is very fitting that Mr Bell becomes a politician. It is the only suitable career choice for someone of his character. As it has often been said a politician is nothing more than an accomplished liar and a successful thief.I highly recommend this movie if you prefer something that leaves you thinking.

The final compliment is when one of his expupils sends his son to the same college.".

It almost reminded my of Shawshank Redemption when a new prisoner arrived at Shawshank in Emerpors Club a new student arrives and nothing will ever be the same but the teacher Kevin Kline or his stufents.

Kevin Kline was great as usual and I liked the phrases he quoted especially an opportunity lost is gone forever. So true so true.The part about the incorrigible student I found very true to life.

Then he is unable to reform the student who cheats. He sees the cheater 25 years later and is a tremendously rich and successful CEO with a beautiful wife and two sons and probably several mis tresses on the side. He stages a rematch of the Julius Caesar competition and cheats once again. When Kevin Kline tries to call him on it the cheater tells him who gives a ep? I live in the real world. The cheater announces his candidacy for the U.S. Senate and his on his way to even more greatness and immortality and the teacher is back to his schlumpy job at the school. Does he have anything to show for his life and his values? The cheater meanwhile will rise to even greater heights. I guess the lesson is that virtue is its own reward. Mmmmm. Yeah right.".

It's based on ideas about how history works and how people work that are antiquated and ignorant.4. Every line in this movie is a clich or sappy or both. 5. Kline's character is a repressive and repressed authoritarian figure who refuses to let his students express themselves or experience life in any way yet the film expects us to take his side throughout. 6. Goddamnit people need to stop making such crappy movies.This movie is predicated on the idea that there are such things as great people whose names and dates will be indelibly incised into history and notgreat people who will be forgotten. The emperors of Rome were great today's corrupt politicians are not and it's the job of high school teachers everywhere to mold the rotten youth of today back into classicalera heroes. The naivet here is so thick it's like being smacked in the face. The fact of the matter is statesmen two thousand years ago along with philosophers teachers and the rest were no less driven by selfinterest than their counterparts today. They lied stole killed raped supported bigotry neglected duties broke laws made unjust laws insulted each other betrayed each other and committed all the trivial and nontrivial day to day cruelties that are a part of the human experience. Yes cultural pressures were different then but it wasn't a utopia by any stretch of the imagination and people were just as flawed as they are today. Kline's character a teacher has a quote on the wall of his classroom by some ruler from the 12th century b.c. who boasts about conquering some place that no longer exists. His name is not remembered by history Kline tells his students because though he conquered he didn't contribute anything to humanity. He was not a great person whereas Socrates and Julias Caesar were. Quite to the contrary we know of important Greeak and Roman figures not at all because they were great in some abstract sense but precisely because the Romans who valued and preserved Greek culture were far and away the dominant political power in Europe and the Middle East for hundreds of years up until Medieval times. It is because of that dominance that their art and history survive and that they were pedestalized by the elite classes of the people who came after them. We remember them because they were conquerers. The author of Kline's plaque is forgotten not because he was any less great than Julias Caesar but because he was worse at establishing lasting empires. The result of this movie's ignorant mistaking of the morally arbitrary machinations of political power throughout history and the chance changes in how history is retold that come with cultural shifts for an ideal system that preserves true greatness and filters out everything else is that the movie is pretty much culturally bigoted. In other words according to the movie only Europeans from GrecoRoman antiquity and possibly American founding fathers can be great people. Yes GrecoRoman antiquity is the subject Kline's character teaches and he would primarily take examples from it but he basically defines greatness as belonging to that specific culture that to be great you must be like the people of that culture and the implication is that people from cultures that the great Greek and Roman leaders conquered are not only not remembered because they lost but also because they're not worth remembering. Similarly people from other places altogether whose cultures don't conform to GrecoRoman standards are inferior and not worth mentioning. Kline's character never cites historical figures from ancient China or Mexico or India or Mali or anywhere else in the world and if you've seen the movie can you honestly imagine him ever thinking it was worth his time to even learn their names? As viewers this movie asks us to embrace what Kline embraces to join him in his love of the greatness of our culture's heritage and implicitly to join him in disregarding the rest of the cultures of the world.Finally this movie is basically just goofy. So this guy has one mediocre student. I'm sorry but that's not going to do it for me. If his student was really having problems the was real kids often do then maybe that would be a bit more compelling. But this kid is just bad because he isn't studious he tries to have fun and he thinks about girls sometimes. Cry me a river. The truth is he's right in a lot of ways when his friends are adults they'll be a lot more happier that they snuck off one day and rowed to the girls' school across the lake and had an actual life experience than that they once memorized the names and dates of some Roman emperors which from what we see is basically the extent of what Kline's character actually teaches.Basically this film is not only crushingly sappy and not compelling it's wrongheaded and a bit offensive too. And all you people who like it have bad taste and should stop reviewing things online you might mislead someone.".

	schema:headline " A thoughtful film portraying the fight between honesty and deceit.";
	schema:reviewBody "I've now seen this film twice and on the second viewing got even more out of its storyline.Although not a difficult concept to reckon with  to choose between honesty and deceitfulness  this movie successfully forces you to ask just why it's wrong to cheat your way to the top  if you can get away with it that is.We all know that cheating is wrong  but why? Fair play is what life is all about playing to the rules and giving everyone an equal chance.In effect this film teaches us nothing we don't know already about lies truth honesty and deceit but it does make you ask why these things remain fundamentally important.It's probably a film that everyone watching will get something different out of. From the idea that here's nothing I didn't know before to the idea that cheating doesn't matter if it doesn't hurt anyone  which is the real measure.The fact that a teacher Kevin Klein decides to encourage a failing student Emile Hirsch by improving his score  at the expense of an already successful pupil  is a clear case of 'morallycorrect cheating'  much like Robin Hood redistributing the wealth from those who have too much to those who have too little although he was a bit more blatant about it.Ultimately though this action fails everyone  including Klein's character.There is a glimmer of hope amongst the ashes at the end of the film  an act of forgiveness which seals the overall lesson being taught by the movie.It's a feelgoodfeelbad film and one which is definitely worth viewing. The acting is consistent and for me the best aspect of the entire movie is the soundtrack which compliments the mood and the action perfectly  one of the most intelligent film scores around.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thrilled by numerous comparisons and analogies with Dead Poets Society I watched The Emperor's Club Maybe I expected too much but however I was disappointed. The promising story about a teacher who inspired his students turned out to be a far from spectacular and hardly inspiring movie with plenty of strangely prepared and rather questionable moral messages. The movie follows a long experience of William Hundert played by Academy award winner Kevin Kline as a professor in a privileged and prestigious school for boys particularly two episodes from his life divided by a long period of time. He is an idealistic teacher who believes that the main purpose of his work is moral development of his students in his own words moving their characters. That sounds pretty good but from very beginning of the movie it meets some problems. Professor Hundert teaches history precisely ancient Roman and Greek history. But besides this Hundert's history classes I guess not the subject of primary importance in such schools the movie is pretty ignorant about the rest of normal life in the school the rest of teachers by some minor details we can guess that not all of them share Hundert's beliefs and students. Our group of students take Hundert's history classes every day in their free time we can see that they're talking about them and learn by heart events and names from Roman history while they dearest ambition is a victory in a traditional school competition based on knowledge of Roman History. At least it's a bit strange and it leaves some kind of emptiness. Moreover Hundert's approaches of reaching his difficult way of moral development of his students are not very clear. Besides for a few sentences like importance of living rightly or what will your contribution be mentioned in a movie trailer most of the time we can see literally only learning of ancient history and in rare moments its interpretation by the way rather superficial and also questionable. The conception of moral development by only education is also a doubtful moment. There are two important scenes that bring some selfcontradiction of the story. First one is when professor Hundert notices that one of his students is reading a history book about famous Carthaginian general the only words he found to say that this material is not included in school program of his course. Pretty strange for such a teacher. The second is related with main moral opponent of professor Hundert Sedgwick Bell. Despite all above mentioned contradictions of the story it insists that before Sedgwick's arriving into that school there was a full idyll. So here we meet Sedgwick Bell a son of a senator who pay no attention to studying and whose behavior is rather too glaringly for others. It looks like a personal challenge for Hundert and after the first signs of understanding and possibly even sympathy between them the student eventually let him down. Here's the main movie conflict a moral confrontation between good and evil and the beginning of future Sedgwick's moral degradation. However it's also not very clear. When Hundert meets Sedgwick's father despite his intentions second important moment mentioned before he comes just as a teacher complaining about a bad student and despite his attempts he is unable to rise above that. What is more the movie never shows teenage Sedgwick as an evil character. His character is too stereotypic image of modern American politics well not only American but all that we can see in the movie is just a childish pranks teenage rebellion easily expected in his age and situation. His lack of good manners in his first days in the school is obviously also signs of protest not rottenness or vicious character. The last part of the movie which obviously was supposed to show moral triumph and superiority of professor Hundert and his students over Sedgwick Bell is also has its contradictions an problem points . Now we meet new Sedgwick Bell a successful citizen businessman and politician. The movie asks a question what cost his social achievements were reached but the idea of rematching school competition after many years as well as the fact that these lessons of ancient history survived in memory of former students after such a long time is farfetched. The same thing is with an imposed impression that throughout the years all students except Sedgwick were successfully moved and inspired by professor Hundert. Using words of other authors possible message of bad apple or leopard spots that evil is always evil meets lots of problem here. Another message about purposes and means the end justifies the means is looking much more suitable here. Aside of the story there are some positive things here. The movie tries to avoid clichs usual for such a movies cinematography is good here some scenes are quite good and finally the acting in the movie is obviously not bad but unfortunately most likely The Emperor's Club is a movie where numerous flaws of the story and weakness of some moral messages easily outweigh all the rest. Kevin Kline and young casts have decent performances. To sum up my thoughts The Emperor's Club is a far from greatness but watchable movie a movie full of large but unrealized ambitions and wasted opportunities. Well at least on the contrary to majority of Hollywood production they tried to make something decent and memorable.".

	schema:headline " Mafiosi love movies too!";
	schema:reviewBody "Elmore Leonard's books must be loved by film screen adapters. His characters translate very well from the written page to the moving picture. Get Shorty is one of Mr. Leonard's best stories and it gets a very good treatment in the hands of Barry Sonnenfeld its director with the help of Scott Frank who adapted it for the screen.The casting of the movie was it's greatest asset. John Travolta is so cool as Chilli the mafioso who loves movies! In his scenes with Gene Hackman he demonstrates what a good actor he is. On the surface he appears to do nothing he works with an economy that is very hard to imitate. Granted after Mr. Travolta's amazing appearance in Pulp Fiction this was a confirmation and validation of his talent.It was surprising since I didn't remember his appearance on the movie to watch actor James Gandolfini prior to his recent fame. He plays a stuntman turned wise guy. Mr. Gandolfini must have gone through a great dental cosmetic transformation unless he was made up to look very ugly as Bear in the film. I have greatly admired his work before his TV series as a fine character actor which he demonstrates here the potential he had and was not discovered until much later.Delroy Lindo is also excellent as one of the bad guys in the film. This actor who is as great in films as in the theater deserves much better. He is a man that always gives an honest performance. Not being a Danny DeVito fan I must confess that he was very restrained here. He can do very good work with the right director behind him as he shows playing the egotistical actor Martin Weir.Also excellent Dennis Farina. It's unfortunate he doesn't get better choices because he is always very effective in whatever he plays. In this film he is hysterical as Ray Bones Barboni. Rene Russo as the bit player with a heart of gold is good. What can be said of Gene Hackman that hasn't already been said? His Harry Zimm is so accurate that we believe he is this sleazy Hollywood producer. Mr. Hackman is a consummate performer who keeps getting better all the time.If I had enjoyed the film the first time looking at it a second time was a revelation.".

	onyx:emotionText "Elmore Leonard's books must be loved by film screen adapters. His characters translate very well from the written page to the moving picture. Get Shorty is one of Mr. Leonard's best stories and it gets a very good treatment in the hands of Barry Sonnenfeld its director with the help of Scott Frank who adapted it for the screen.The casting of the movie was it's greatest asset. John Travolta is so cool as Chilli the mafioso who loves movies! In his scenes with Gene Hackman he demonstrates what a good actor he is. On the surface he appears to do nothing he works with an economy that is very hard to imitate. Granted after Mr. Travolta's amazing appearance in Pulp Fiction this was a confirmation and validation of his talent.It was surprising since I didn't remember his appearance on the movie to watch actor James Gandolfini prior to his recent fame. He plays a stuntman turned wise guy. Mr. Gandolfini must have gone through a great dental cosmetic transformation unless he was made up to look very ugly as Bear in the film. I have greatly admired his work before his TV series as a fine character actor which he demonstrates here the potential he had and was not discovered until much later.Delroy Lindo is also excellent as one of the bad guys in the film. This actor who is as great in films as in the theater deserves much better. He is a man that always gives an honest performance.

	schema:reviewBody "I am not sure whether I liked the movie or just John Travolta and his character Chili Palmer. I had a lot of fun watching 'Get Shorty' based on the novel by Elmore Leonard so it doesn't really matter. The movie is about a mobster from Miami Chili Palmer who ends up in Los Angeles. After meeting a movie producer named Harry Zimm Gene Hackman he gets interested in the movie business. This is the main story but this movie is based on an Elmore Leonard story so there are a lot of subplots with lots of interesting characters all with great dialogue.Besides Chili Palmer and Harry Zimm we meet Karen Flores Rene Russo an actress known for her screaming Martin Weir Danny DeVito who is the hot actor of the moment Ray Bones Dennis Farina who wants to collect some money that Chili has Bo Catlett Delroy Lindo who wants money fro Harry Zimm Bear James Gandolfini who was a stuntman but now is Bo's bodyguard Leo Devoe David Paymer who stole the money that brought Chili to Los Angeles and Doris Bette Midler. All characters are colorful have great dialogue and an interesting part in the story but all those great things are there together with Chili. For every nice moment Travolta is present.The actors play their characters very well. Again Travolta is great and owns the movie but especially Farina and Hackman do a great job as well. The movie is well directed by Barry Sonnenfeld from 'The Addams Family' knowing how to avoid boring moments. The story with its dialogue would be enough to make a nice movie out of it. Fortunately we have the actors and direction to make it even better and definitely more entertaining.".

Zimm is a producer of major motion pictures read B horror flicks. His lover is Karen Rene Russo. His meetings give Palmer the movie bug.Already a huge movie fan Palmer decides to produce Mr. Lovejoy a script that Zimm proclaims will be hs Driving Miss Daisy.

And Palmer has access to 300000 generated from Las Vegas winnings of the missing deadbeat Leo. As a further complication there is a drug dealer Delroy Lindo who has invested in one of Zimm's pictures. But he has gotten in trouble with his supplier for 500000 and a missing nephew.DeVito does a wonderful job playing the selfinvolved pretentious Weir. There are wonderful comments about screen writers. Spelling is optional not necessary. The role of a screenwriter is just to put the commas in where they belong. Travolta is delightful as a nice guy wiseguy. In fact the entire cast is just great.The plot lines never overwhelm the film and they fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. Note Thanks to Pulp Fiction studios are willing now to use nonlinear plot lines on occasion.. The ending is terrific watch for the cameo by Harvey Keitel. I saw this in the theatre and have seen it several times on video. This one is definitely a keeper.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie in 1995 when first released but never got around to thinking about a review until I saw it again a few weeks back on late night TV. I'd forgotten just how good it is...From a novel by Elmore Leonard this story is arguably the best satire about the Hollywood dream factory yet done for two reasons it savagely exposes and lampoons the behaviors of actors writers producers and directors and it implicitly compares that business with the business of small time hoodlums and loan sharks. So many times during this story does Chili Palmer John Travolta announce in a bemused fashion I can't believe how youse guys do business out here... Chili as we learn very early is a loan shark from Miami who is ordered by Bones Dennis Farina his new boss to recover a 15000 debt from Leo David Paymer a loser with a garrulous wife Fay Linda Hart who's helped Leo fake his own death on a plane crash and collect 300000 as a settlement from the airline. Fay of course can't keep her mouth shut and tells Chili that Leo scammed the money and was now living it up in Vegas. Chili in Vegas finds out that Leo has gone to LA. But Chili also makes a score a Vegas casino owner asks him to lean on an LA movie producer Harry Zimm Gene Hackman for 150000 still owing.So off to LaLa Land goes Chili and that's where the fun really starts...The plot then changes direction almost completely Chili after recovering most of the 300000 from Leo and letting him off lightly gets involved with Harry in two ways  first convinces him to take on Chili's own idea for a movie production and second fend off two investors who just happened to be drug pushers also who want their money back from Harry who  you guessed it  is late in getting some other movie off the ground and has spent all their money.However those two pushy investors Bo Catlett and Ronnie Wingate Delroy Lindo and John Gries have another problem the 500000 drug money that they can't retrieve from a locker box at LAX and which Chili sees as an opportunity to make more profit. That idea however is blown away when Bones  who would like nothing better than to see Chili dead  arrives from Miami looking to muscle in on Chili's business in LA.How all that threads together into a gloriously comedic and ironic slice of Hollywood life and death is a testament to Leonard's brilliant story a great screenplay and cinematography and tight editing  not to mention the almost flawless acting by actors who are continually taking the mickey out of the whole business right up to the final scene.There's no doubt that this is Travolta's comeback movie. The guy just oozes dangerous cool and  ooops  chilling competence as he maneuvers between the high and low life of a strange town with some very strange people and even stranger business practices. But kudos also go to Dennis Farina Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito as the klutzes they portray and Renee Russo is suitably decorous as Chili's love interest. Watch out for cameos from Bette Midler Harvey Keitel and other Hollywood luminaries.And here's the supreme selfreferential irony there really is a real Chili Palmer in the movie he's one of the actors who has a bit part as one of Bones' buddies! What a gag...Finally note the title Get Shorty. That's Elmore Leonard's delicious swipe at the whole gangster genre. Remember Get Carter 1971...? HohoHOhoho! Highly recommended.".

But Chili also makes a score a Vegas casino owner asks him to lean on an LA movie producer Harry Zimm Gene Hackman for 150000 still owing.So off to LaLa Land goes Chili and that's where the fun really starts...The plot then changes direction almost completely Chili after recovering most of the 300000 from Leo and letting him off lightly gets involved with Harry in two ways  first convinces him to take on Chili's own idea for a movie production and second fend off two investors who just happened to be drug pushers also who want their money back from Harry who  you guessed it  is late in getting some other movie off the ground and has spent all their money.However those two pushy investors Bo Catlett and Ronnie Wingate Delroy Lindo and John Gries have another problem the 500000 drug money that they can't retrieve from a locker box at LAX and which Chili sees as an opportunity to make more profit. That idea however is blown away when Bones  who would like nothing better than to see Chili dead  arrives from Miami looking to muscle in on Chili's business in LA.How all that threads together into a gloriously comedic and ironic slice of Hollywood life and death is a testament to Leonard's brilliant story a great screenplay and cinematography and tight editing  not to mention the almost flawless acting by actors who are continually taking the mickey out of the whole business right up to the final scene.There's no doubt that this is Travolta's comeback movie. The guy just oozes dangerous cool and  ooops  chilling competence as he maneuvers between the high and low life of a strange town with some very strange people and even stranger business practices. But kudos also go to Dennis Farina Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito as the klutzes they portray and Renee Russo is suitably decorous as Chili's love interest. Watch out for cameos from Bette Midler Harvey Keitel and other Hollywood luminaries.And here's the supreme selfreferential irony there really is a real Chili Palmer in the movie he's one of the actors who has a bit part as one of Bones' buddies! What a gag...Finally note the title Get Shorty. That's Elmore Leonard's delicious swipe at the whole gangster genre. Remember Get Carter 1971...? HohoHOhoho! Highly recommended.";

It's intelligent and funny. Almost no dialog falls flat.The mood as I would call it is amazing. The jazz score sets a nice tone as does the overall style and the pace. It's cool to use an overused term.Chili Palmer amazingly played by Travolta reminds me a bit of Bugs Bunny. Totally in control at all times with everyone else looking a bit silly. Like Bugs Bunny it's the total fantasy of being totally in control. Probably one of the more appealing aspects.The cast is full of stars who are given great lines to deliver as well.The characters are all fun.In short I can't think of too many movies that are this enjoyable over the whole movie.I own the book and have read part of it it's signed by the author. The movie is so good that the book never quite holds my attention long enough to read it. I think if I had read the book first maybe I would feel differently.Someone suggested watching Jackie Brown rather than this movie. They are both great and totally different. I suggest seeing BOTH.".

Take one shylock from  Miami John Travolta add one B grade movie producer Harry Zimm Gene Hackman mix with a lessthansharp wiseguy Dennis Farina and move the gang to Los Angeles.  Once there meet Karen Flores Rene Russo and the star of the moment Martin Weir Danny DeVito and mix well. This movie is entertaining and the hysterical humor in it works. Hackman is hilarious without trying as Harry Zimm a B grade producer Chili Palmer pays a visit to and decides to stay. Chili Palmer Travolta is a wise guy who finds his real calling is in producing  movies.  Look at me is Chili's attention getting tag line that soon everyone who meets Chili starts using to sound as dangerous as Chili acts.  Dennis Farina plays Ray Barbone another wise guy who by default becomes Chili's boss and is after money owed to him.  Farina who used to be a real life cop is both comical and in his element in this movie. Delroy Lindo is cast as a wannabe producer and hitman with great style and aplumb not to mention a dazzling colorful wardrobe. James Gandolfini is very convincing as Lindo's sidekick Bear with a southern accent who happens to be a stunt guy too.  As all these ingredients come together a great and worthy movie comes together as all key characters plot and plan to help Zimm a great comic turn for Gene Hackman who never let's his audience down get a large movie produced and made.  Danny De Vito as always is a fine actor who despite his small stature can fill a big screen as the big star of the moment in Hollywood in Get Shorty. This movie is Goodfellas meets LA Confidential.  The casting is superb the supporting cast is a must have ensemble and this movie takes off superbly from the opening scene in Miami and continues with a blast to Los Angeles where Chili decides he wants to be a movie producer and what Chili wants Chili gets. Travolta's Saturday Night Fever swagger is alive and well in this comical wiseguy Hollywood movie. His maturity adds depth that was lacking in my opinion during his Fever days.  Travolta is a superb actor second to none and Get Shorty is a clever wellacted movie worth keeping for a second look because it is such a pleasure to watch the first time.If you're up for some great acting by Hollywood's finest and want some hysterical laughs Get Shorty is for you. Hey look at me! I give this movie a 9 out of 10 for it's humor it's plot it's casting and it's ability to flat out entertain you. If you need to dissect a movie to see what makes it tick I suggest Das Boot but if you want a great movie with lots of laughs this one is for  you.I also recommend Pulp Fiction and yet another Travolta vehicle Primary Colors.  Travolta has grown into his acting and is natural on the big screen as both a great character actor and a movie star able to combine humor with incredibly convincing roles.  Broken Arrow and FaceOff are two more examples of the phenomenal Travolta who is one of few that crossed over from teen sensation to major movie star with staying power.Get Shorty is a must see movie with plenty of action and nonstop laughs.".

	schema:reviewBody "When his boss has a heart attack mob hard man Chili Palmer finds himself working indirectly for Ray Barboni. Barboni's instance on picking through his books and finds the case of a drycleaner who owes money but is dead. With pressure to cover the debt himself Chili sets out to find the man who he knows isn't really dead  his search takes him to LA where he follows up another debt in the form of Harry Zimm. Zimm is a producer of trashy movies and Chili sees him as his way into the movie business and out of loan sharking  businesses that he realises are actually not that different.With the release and drubbing of the sequel I decided to take the chance to watch the original film again and review it because I hadn't seen it since it first came out a decade ago. The story is potentially quite messy as it has quite a few threads with different characters coming and going quite quickly and it is to its credit that it manages to hold it all together and bring it off satisfyingly well. It doesn't have a great deal of depth of course but it only aims to be slick and it manages to do this pretty well considering. The script has plenty of injokes to match the slick dialogue and narrative and the story does move along in a manner that is enjoyable on several levels. I think claims that it is hilarious is maybe taking it a bit too far because it isn't really laugh out loud funny more than once or twice but it is entertaining in a stylish and slick way that makes it quite fun to watch.The cast really help and the majority of them give enjoyable performances even if the aforementioned depth isn't there for them to do a great deal with. Travolta enjoys a funnier version of the role that gave him his midnineties comeback with Pulp Fiction and he handles himself well  as slick as he is sleek and with a really cool presence that is important since the character is nothing more than cool presence. De Vito does really well sending up movie stars specifically if we are to believe all we read Dustin Hoffman but Russo seems to be an addition with nothing specific to do despite her still being enjoyable. Farina can do mobsters in his sleep so at least here he gets to enjoy himself at the same time Lindo is a good match for Travolta and is a good bit of casting with good support from Gandolfini. In joke cameos are take it or leave it so they are not critical to the film but Keitel Baldwin and Marshall stand out as being in there.Overall this is not a film that is hilarious or one that has great character development. Rather what it is is a slick story told with style and swagger  much like Chili himself. The plot threads are helped by not ever having a lot of detail behind them to be picked up but they are still potentially messy and the film does well to bring them all together in a pleasing and knowing fashion. The starry cast is good value and all in all the film is entertaining which was all I really wanted from it in the first place.".

In joke cameos are take it or leave it so they are not critical to the film but Keitel Baldwin and Marshall stand out as being in there.Overall this is not a film that is hilarious or one that has great character development. Rather what it is is a slick story told with style and swagger  much like Chili himself. The plot threads are helped by not ever having a lot of detail behind them to be picked up but they are still potentially messy and the film does well to bring them all together in a pleasing and knowing fashion. The starry cast is good value and all in all the film is entertaining which was all I really wanted from it in the first place.";

	schema:headline " Great characters simply a good comedy with a waterproof plot";
	schema:reviewBody "Get Shorty is a celebration of that usual Barry Sonnenfeld style of film making. Great characters done by a great cast including John Travolta Gene Hackman Rene Russo Danny DeVito Dennis Farina Delroy Lindo and.. Well the list just goes on and on. A perfect mixup of that so called charactercomedy a movie progressing and dependant on the characters making it hilarious comedy chaos.The best thing about this film is obviously the whole cast John Travolta as the smooth bad ass Chili Palmer Gene Hackman as the hectic Harry Zimm. A bit unusual role from Hackman which also makes the character so hilariously surreal. Rene Russo as the girl Karen Flores Danny DeVito as the movie star Martin Weir with a huge ego Dennis Farina as the loud mouth usual himself Ray 'Bones' Barboni. Delroy Lindo as the tough Bo Catlett and James Gandolfini as Bo's bodyguard failed stuntman Bear. Everyone just simply click together which makes the movie even better than it actually is. It's just all about the characters. Chili Palmer must be one of the coolest characters ever seen on the big screen.Like mentioned before Barry Sonnenfeld is the director of the movie and I honestly can't imagine anyone else directing a movie with a screenplay like this except Steven Soderbergh the director of for example both Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's Twelve. I think that Sonnenfeld's and Soderbergh's styles connect together they are very similar. And if they'd do a British version of the movie the director would be Guy Ritchie without a doubt. If you recognised both Soderbergh and Ritchie then you know the style I'm talking about and if you like both of their movies you should see Get Shorty. The other thing similar between these three directors besides the directing is the music used in their films. It's that usual horns and trumpets giving that funky and exciting feeling for the film. It just fits for movies like these creating that what is needed for the style. It also connects with the cinematography as well Sudden movements of the angles sudden stops shots really close of the faces in these specific angles and when you add the music to that it's voil.Get Shorty is all in all a great comedy with a plot that doesn't go over the silliness level. Sometimes movies like these go over that level which usually make them funnier but also makes the whole story so unbelievable that it just isn't enjoyable as a movie anymore. Well the movie itself isn't THAT serious it's a comedy after all but it's definitely some quality entertainment. It includes a nice storyline great characters and directing that just doesn't let you down. I recommend this movie to everyone once again. It's not amazing or phenomenal it's a nice piece of entertainment keeping you glued to your sofa throughout. What more can you ask for a boring Friday evening?".

It has an amazing cast a pleasant light way of storytelling and a cleverly written story featuring some great stereotypical gangstertype of characters.So ever wondered what would happen if gangster interfered with producing Hollywood movies? See Get Shorty if your curious about the result. It's an unusual original story about tough gangster put in an unnatural environment who thinks that are making movies is the same as any other criminal activity.The movie is cleverly written with many different characters that all follow one and the same plot line. All characters have different motivations but they are all cleverly connected to each other. The many characters often mix and meet each other in the events which also causes all of their motivations to mix. The movie is really cleverly written and executed. It perhaps sounds like a complicated and hard movie to follow but it really is a light great written and pleasant one to watch.The movie also works because of the many fine characters and of course the actors that portray them. Basically every character in the movie is deliciously stereotypical from the Hollywoodproducer to the stunt guy and from the successful acclaimed Hollywood actor to the mobster boss. The movie is well cast with actors that are obviously not cast because of their comical talents but purely because of their acting skills. The cast is one to kill for. John Travolta of course knows how to play a cool and likable gangster. Gene Hackman also plays one of his most fun roles as lowbudget Hollywood producer who thinks that he is going to make it big time. Danny DeVito is great as an Hollywoodactor and Dennis Farina Delroy Lindo Miguel Sandoval provide the good gangster parts of the movie. David Paymer also does what he can do best playing a guy with a hat. The movie is filled with many more well known actors in small roles such as Bette Midler and James Gandolfini and even small cameo appearances such as Harvey Keitel makes.Also mainly due to the movie its professional cast this is not an hilarious type of movie but more the sort of movie that has a constant pleasant and light atmosphere that will surely put a smile on your face. The comedy is more of the subtle kind that everybody should be able to appreciate. Nothing in the movie ever feels forced no matter how crazy and mixed up the movie and its situations ever get.As far as the '90's go this movie is about as cool as they could get. This movie was the definition of cool in the '90's at the time of its release. Of course times have changed now but the movie still has an overall cool atmosphere and pleasant way of storytelling. It's a light fun movie to watch and rewatch over and over again.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

In Get Shorty Hollywood is a town where the cool show business types drive minivans and anybody can write a script because the just have hire someone to put in the commas and stuff. Scenes and characters flow from one to the next creating a kinetic energy that is a hallmark of Director Barry Sonnenfeld. Actors in simultaneous story lines cross paths and seem to hand the batton to one another. Dennis Farina just about steals the movie as a dimwitted mobster. In early discovery roles Delroy Lindo and James Gandolfini both show why they are now Alisters. Repeat viewings don't disappoint and if anything reveal even more details.

	schema:reviewBody "Despite this British sitcom's surprisingly farreaching fan base not a single seat of the four hundred in my cinema was left unoccupied I still find myself having to explain the show to family members casual acquaintances and my favourite movieloving cab driver on the way home. So a quick recap. The premise is simple we follow four friends on the fringe of social status somewhere between the 'normal kids' and the 'freaks' as they meander their way through high school and its teenage perils. There's the nerdy but levelheaded narrator Will Simon Bird selfish relationshipdependent Simon Joe Thomas compulsive liar and bignoter Jay James Buckley and lovable dimwit Neil Blake Harrison. The film picks up naturally during the last day of school. The boys decide to book a party holiday to Greece to help Simon get over his breakup with Carli but things get hairy when Simon who is at the furthest point from being over his ex spots her on the same trip.If I had to justify why I loved this film with one sentence it would be this at no point does it stray from the formula that made the show so refreshing. The humour is there as are the scenes of incredible social awkwardness but this consistency begins with proper characterisation. Every fan of the show has a personal favourite and should be pleased to hear that their move to the big screen has not coerced creators Beesley and Morris into thinking they should customise the characters to suit a wider audience. By the end of the film each of the four is in an inherently better position in their life than they were two hours ago but how they all get there remains entrenched in typical Inbetweeners fashion.What does this mean exactly? It means that the screenplay puts individual character development on the backburner for most of the film instead preferring to fill every scene with a truckload of jokes ranging from slapstick the spoken word and a merciless array of cringeworthy moments the kind that have become the niche of the series. In any other genre this could be considered a sour point but comedies are granted exceptions on the basis that they exist primarily to entertain not to provide a moral or indeed much deep thinking at all. Does each character learn something about their life through their experience in Greece? Sure. Should we expect them to let the rest of their life be guided by these same profound moments of clarity? I doubt it.Anyone even slightly familiar with the series would be aware of its unrelentingly crude subject matter which some might interpret as vulgar or even offensive. That's a personal call and while it doesn't concern my comedic sensibilities in the slightest I must warn the more politically correct among us that this is not a movie for you. Few social taboos are left undisturbed and when you couple this with the notion that filmmakers can get away with a lot more on the big screen a saying that rings especially true for The Inbetweeners it is recommended that fencesitters have a long think about how they feel about the series lest they return home with the unexplained compulsion to take a boiling hot bath and scrub until a little skin comes off.If I had to make a couple of minor criticisms I would say that a handful of party clichs are overdone see fronton shots of friends walking in slow motion through a club with big grins on their faces and that some realism is lost when Simon appears too gullible to be believed you'll know it when you see it. However these moments are few and far between and fail to detract from making this the funniest movie I've seen in a good few years.There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsisiprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.".

Will Simon Jay and Neil are all together as the group head out to Malia for a lads holiday after leaving school. It is meant to be the holiday of a life time but in classic inbetweeners style not everything goes to plan.The film is meant to be a fair well to the guys after three very successful TV series and the lads go out in style. The opening of the film sees Simon being dumped by Carli which gives Jay the idea that the group should leave their troubles behind and have a holiday full of drink girls and many other things. The holiday shows the boys at the highest of highs and the lowest of lows but in the end having the time of their lives.These characters have made me laugh for the past couple of years on television and I was sad to hear that the third series would be the last. However I was pleasantly surprised when I heard about the movie being made. It would be a final send off to four of the funniest faces on TV. The film just like the show gives each character their own problems and triumphs as the film goes on and as we expect some very embarrassing moments. The film is very funny and has numerous laugh out loud moments but the great thing is the spirit of the film. It has a good heart and a script that gives the characters we care about fitting conclusions.The credit has to be given to the writers Ian Morris and Damon Beesley who wrote the show as well. This is more then just a spin off from the show it is a uplifting tale for the four boys full of plenty of laughs. I hope the film receives praise from the critics as it is more then just the comedy of the year but in my mind one of the best films of the year.Never disappointed or bored at any point in the film the inbetweeners movie is a wonderful tale of coming of age. You will be pushed to find a more entertaining and funny film all year. I loved it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't get me wrong  I loved The Inbetweeners series which packed a freshness and sparkle that far outshone many of the pallid comedic offerings of the late noughties. In all accounts sadly I feel the film failed to capture the magic of the show.The movie plot positively throbs with potential  horny teens a chavvy holiday destination a pot of money from a dead grandparent.

I didn't find it bad by any means and most of my feelings were based on my somewhat ignorance of British humor and lack of any knowledge of the TV program it's based on. I just thought it's somewhat funny and I liked how the movie that reminded me a lot of the original American Pie but was very unabashed with its characters compared to how backwards we're here.Luckily as the movie progressed it became more and more comical hilarious and those four boys really grew on me  all individually.Perhaps that was because I finally did get more used to the humor and understood more. But I believe it was how invested I was getting with the depth and hilarity displayed in the main stars.Yeah if I saw the TV show  that I've never heard of before this screening  first perhaps I'd already be into their individual personalities.Here nor there. This movie brilliantly made to stand alone follows four British lads after their to us High School graduation and then immediately on holiday to Malia. Obviously they're going there to get laid boozed up celebrate their friendship and let us enjoy their misadventures with four girls they meet.The four guys are pretty much England's version of the American Pie dudes and each uniquely fun. Will the cute and nerdy one aside from his Austin Powers grill is the virgin and smart alecky one. Jay's the horndog selfish one and Simon's the hungup on his obviously badforhim exgirlfriend. And finally one I didn't like up front but really grew on me Neil the jolly chap who's probably the horniest most positive and innocent of all.After awhile I loved watching them and their interactions with the females who were also entertaining. Enough so I would like to get the series this was based on and then rewatch this supposedly movie made to close out the TV program.Finally from a personal perspective its nice seeing how guys overseas aren't so hung up on sexuality and nudity as this prude country is. If you were to put a copy of American Pie and The Inbetweeners Movie in front of me like all my other choices I make I'll go with this  the unedited version. Any day.".

It was like when I watched Episode II and Padme fell in love with Anakin because of nothing  just because it had to happen even though he acted like a total moron. That's what happens in this movie all the time. Three of the four boys always do the worst thing possible but the girls stick with them as if they were the only boys on the island. In some parts it's so frustrating that I wanted to leave the cinema. And then it really wants to end like a love story as if that was the way people may fall in love although everybody knows it wouldn't even happen in the Twilight Zone. And OMG don't let me start about a guy who wants to go to college and gives away all his clothes to a stranger trusting... no seriously.

	onyx:emotionText "It's just a movie and it should just entertain but thats so far away from reality that I wasn't able to laugh about anything because this illogicalness annoyed me so much. It was like when I watched Episode II and Padme fell in love with Anakin because of nothing  just because it had to happen even though he acted like a total moron. That's what happens in this movie all the time. Three of the four boys always do the worst thing possible but the girls stick with them as if they were the only boys on the island. In some parts it's so frustrating that I wanted to leave the cinema. And then it really wants to end like a love story as if that was the way people may fall in love although everybody knows it wouldn't even happen in the Twilight Zone. And OMG don't let me start about a guy who wants to go to college and gives away all his clothes to a stranger trusting... no seriously. If you really don't care whats actually happening in this movie besides the comedy you might be able to find this kinda funny but if you even need the tiniest piece of logic you may prolly just sit there shaking your head.

	schema:reviewBody "So back in 2008 the UK was introduced to yet another foulmouthed rude and disgusting comedy show...and it was more British brilliance. Easily the most semi offensive filthy and sexually profanity ridden show to hit our screens since Bottom and that was tame in comparison. The whole premise is basically centred around childish immature toilet humour typical boyish low brow school smut that most every British male can relate to because they probably grew up doing and saying the same things.The TV show revolved around four young boys struggling through their school years which included various stereotypical themes which again many will relate too. The most common of these was the attempt and failure of many many sexual encounters with girls from their school or where ever these sexual escapades made up the bulk of the shows plots. Yes it sounds like a wholly clichd and unoriginal but that doesn't deter us Brits when it comes to embarrassing sexual innuendos and smut.This movie carries on from where the TV show left off after the final third series which we all thought had finished for good. The lads are still mates and they're off on their holidays to sunny Malia Crete Greece. That is basically the plot right there you don't really need to know anything about the TV show or what happened you can quite easily watch this on its own and get the drift perfectly. There might be the odd moment which you might not get if you haven't watched the TV show but generally you should be fine.If ever there was a bad advert on a mass scale for Brits abroad then this has gotta be high on the list. I'm not referring to all Brits of course but mainly the younger binge drinking generation that we all know and loathe these days. Yep its the stereotypical vision of modern day British youths abroad getting blind drunk having or hunting for guilt free animalistic sex drugs vomit feces and lots of football shirts. Its exactly what you'd expect as a British viewer which is both hilarious at times and utterly shameful at others we all know what goes down in these types of places amazed it wasn't filmed in Magaluf probably too extreme.Whilst the TV show seems anarchic and unpredictable this film really feels like a let down in my eyes. Gone are the fresh wild obnoxious antics...instead replaced with every known clich from the book of clichs besides that we saw all this before with 'Kevin and Perry Go Large'. The one that has been implanted into this story is emotion and some solid character development. The guys do seems to grow as we see them fall out make up and meet the girls of their dreams...naturally not being the type of girls they expected. Although again its kinda obvious 'Jay' gets a tubby bird and starts to show signs of maturing 'Will' get a hot blonde 'Simon' finally moves on from 'Carly' with a brunette and 'Neil' finds a slightly ditzy girl the same height as himself.Generally I found this movie kinda depressing actually there is tonnes of negativity with the guys trying to find girls trying to be popular and trying to fit in. There are of course the highs but I found there to be more lows really lows and lots of cringeworthy behaviour which somehow didn't seem as funny as the TV show. Most of the laughs tend to be the most obvious and over used clichs such as the shitty hotel aging desperate women dressed in unflattering attire too much booze with obligatory vomiting hot babes buff jocks and the old gag of the rude doodle burnt into burnt into your back. I guess the old school location of...errr their school works the best prime example being the fantastic small sequence with Greg Davies as 'Mr Gilbert' the Headmaster giving a rousing speech at the start. Its reasonable fun in places but on the whole it can't live up to the original show despite the usual good performances from the main cast.5.510".

Unfortunately The Inbetweeners never attains anything approaching actual comedy. The main descriptive terms which come to mind are animalistic degrading and boring.

It is essentially an extended episode instead of rolling this out as a summer or Christmas special under differing circumstances writers Damon Beesley and Iain Morris who were the primary writers on the television series have shrewdly decidedly to capitalize on the series' short fame and enter the cinematic market instead. Will's Simon Bird narration returns as does the crude jokes and the toilet humour but isn't that what made the 'Inbetweeners' so hilariously funny? It's a silly contains a formulaic plot and stereotypical characters but what really makes the four boys work is there childish banter and sexual optimism that reminds us all of what it was like to be eighteen again.The last time we saw them on the smallscreen they were finishing up a bonding trip into the woods as each one of them were on a knife edge deciding what they would do for the rest of their lives university or the meatcounter at ASDA with a potential promotion up to the checkout in the works? But before they must decide what to do for the rest of their lives also known as the next five years they have six weeks to think it over and take the obligatory 'lads holiday' which is an old wise British tradition for any male who reaches the age of eighteen. The tradition consists of the boys going abroad to a country which in this case is Malia with plenty of sun sea sand and bars and seeing how much tolerance their body has to the effects of copious amounts of alcohol before attempting to see if this makes them any more or less attractive to the fellow British revellers. Premise nice simple and set and the narrative pretty many rolls it's self out from here.Again the stars of the show are the characters with Will's offbeat precocious nature a nice alternative to the foulmouthed tirades of Jay James Buckley which have seemingly got more and more crude as the television show has gone on. Neil Blake Harrison on the other hand acts as welcome relief always guaranteeing to make a laugh out of any innocuous comment he makes which is especially helpful during the scenes involving the continued romance between Simon Joe Thomas and Carly Emily Head as it is one of those aspects they should have left to die gracefully with the television series as it seemingly drags on and on with little in the way of a rewarding conclusion. While Allison Laura Haddock provides the romantic interest for Will and their scenes are somewhat touching as they both seem fishoutofwater in this world of drinking for twenty hours eating for two and sleeping for five minutes.It will almost certainly come away empty handed when the awards season comes sweeping around in Britain and it might not very favourable with the print and online critics but it isn't half bad as it never tries to be anything more than an featurelength episode. The jokes are still there Jay's miraculous lies crop up every now and again a few old and new faces make welcome cameo's and the boys still get caught up in many embarrassing situations the majority of which involve the involuntarily showcasing of their genitals. If you look beyond the unoriginal narrative the onedimensional primary protagonists the stereotypical love interests and the unsophisticated jokes you will probably enjoy this film for what it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many great TV shows which never made it to our local screens. While we are familiar with sitcoms like Friends for those who are well a little older and Glee we don't know anyone who does not like this cultural phenomenon there are sitcoms like The Inbetweeners which are just as good  if not better. And how do we know that?It's British.The award winning production aired for three seasons from 2008 to 2010 in Britain and has been nominated at BAFTA and won accolades at the British Academy Television Awards and the British Comedy Awards. The episodic adventures of a suburban teenager are chronicled in this series as he and his friends make life work at the fictional Rudge Park Comprehensive. This movie version follows their misadventures as they go on a holiday in Crete after their final year at school together. It is supposed to serve as an ending to the TV series written by creators Damon Beesley and Iain Morris.The film directed by Ben Palmer is a hoot to watch especially if you step into the theatre with no background knowledge of the series or the personalities of the four protagonists Will Simon Jay and Neil. The fun and joy is sitting through the 97 minute movie slowly knowing these four characters played by Simon Bird Joe Thomas James Buckley and Blake Harrison. With each of them displaying a unique personality you are reminded of your own memories of hanging out with your friends on your first overseas trip. It helps of course if you are a guy.We haven't seen the original TV series to know what the humour is like but judging from this movie we can tell you that this is one teen comedy that will leave you in stitches. While it the shyer viewer probably of the female species may be slightly embarrassed by some of the scenes warning expect to see err genitalia the movie never becomes distasteful and offensive. While some may consider it on the brinks of becoming obnoxious the crude humour remains truly funny throughout. Maybe it's the British accent or maybe it's the socially awkward boys who you cannot bear to hate  this is a comedy that you will enjoy. Narrated by Bird's character Will the boys' holiday is marked with drugs booze and sex or so they had hoped. Things go wrong in the most hilarious ways and each of them ends up in different unthinkable consequences. Watch out for a scene where the four boys attempt to steal the sun tan chairs at a hotel pool  you don't know whether to sympathize or laugh at them when things go awry.Amidst the laughs there is heart in the movie. There are stories of love tales of friendship and how people stand by each other at the end of the day. You'll come to realise that while not every one of us has the fortune to live the perfect life it is the people around us that matters the most.".

While it the shyer viewer probably of the female species may be slightly embarrassed by some of the scenes warning expect to see err genitalia the movie never becomes distasteful and offensive. While some may consider it on the brinks of becoming obnoxious the crude humour remains truly funny throughout. Maybe it's the British accent or maybe it's the socially awkward boys who you cannot bear to hate  this is a comedy that you will enjoy. Narrated by Bird's character Will the boys' holiday is marked with drugs booze and sex or so they had hoped. Things go wrong in the most hilarious ways and each of them ends up in different unthinkable consequences. Watch out for a scene where the four boys attempt to steal the sun tan chairs at a hotel pool  you don't know whether to sympathize or laugh at them when things go awry.Amidst the laughs there is heart in the movie. There are stories of love tales of friendship and how people stand by each other at the end of the day. You'll come to realise that while not every one of us has the fortune to live the perfect life it is the people around us that matters the most.";

Moreover Katrina Kaif also looked fake and was not able to do her best. I have seen her performing better in some other movies. Yes the locations are good but its the plot and the acting that drags the movie to a new low. With the amount of money spent on this movie it would have been better to get in some more substance rather than the effects. Sanjay Dutt is not at his best and disappoints as well. The only highlight of this movie is some SKIN show by Lara Dutta but that cannot make up for the bad experience. She has given steamy scenes in a lot of movies but this ain't the best. It would have been better if it was an exact copy of Into The Blue it was better and the plot was good. Movie is good in parts but fails as a whole package. Maybe it was the expectation and the hype however it was a very lame movie with nothing new except the underwater sequence.If you have nothing else to do and want to kill your time you may go and watch this movie. Not recommended for people who have high expectations.".

The lady in blue story is pretty good even though it consists of a stupid investigation in accusing the captain of being a traitor.

	schema:reviewBody "Starring  Sunjay DuttAkshay KumarZayed KhanLara DuttaKylie MinogueDirector  Anthony D'SouzaRating   12Since the past one month or so wherever i go be it a night club or a wedding or just usual hangout spots i noticed the songs of Blue playing over 'n' over. That's called excellent publicity. It would do good to any movie only if with a BIG IF the movie is good or at least decent. That is not the case with Blue.Excellent publicity can't do good for a really BAD and PATHETIC movie. When i first saw the promo of the movie i thought this might not be the most critically acclaimed film of the year but it should be a Fun to watch popcorn movie. But no it turns out to be a stinking affair smellier than Mr Akshay Kumar's socks which he's wearing since his last successful film Singh is Kinng although that movie wasn't a good one but still it was way better than Blue. First lets just get to the premise of the film. The plot revolves around the trio mainly Sunjay DuttSagar Akhshay KumarAarav Sagar's friend and Zayed KhanSam Sagar's younger brother. Also there is Lara DuttaMona Sagar's better half and Katrina KaifNikki and Rahul DevGulshan.Sagar and Aarav are friends together they go fishing and have an occasional boxing face off. Aarav tries to convince Sagar to go treasure hunting with him because only Sagar knows the whereabouts of it. But Sagar refuses due to the reason that his father lost his life while searching for that treasure and blames himself for his father's death.The story cuts to Sam who is in Malaysia doing bike races he gets a job from GulshanRahul Dev to deliver a package but he loses it on the way now Gulshan wants either his package back or 50 million. NikkiKatrina Sam's love interest and also working with Gulshan advices him to leave Malaysia and go somewhere else so he goes to Bahamas to his elder brother Sagar that's where the main story begins.Coming to the main highlight of this film the underwater sequences believe me they were that good. Excellent lighting and camera angles and shots makes it look like an international affair. But that's the only thing good about Blue. The action sequences are passable to say the least. No thrilling action sequence is to be found here. Only lamemoneyspendinggoodfornothing kind of action sequences are there. Specifically the bike chase sequence the one involving some 45 bikes and a train was so lame the bikes which were supposed to be on the chase seems like they are out on a picnic and are grouping together to enjoy the sightseeing including the guy on the bike they were supposed to be chasing. If that doesn't make you shake your head in disbelief then the dialogs would definitely do that for instance Aarav saying Lets go take out the treasure from the sea as if he's talking about going for window shopping and that too for a toothbrush. Also there's another one Mona saying Can't we just talk peacefully with them? even when she and Sagar are being attacked by armed men. These do work as Unintentional jokes. And believe me there are many more.Also the plot holes are so big you can virtually make Jupiter pass through it. For instance the SoCalled treasure which is lying in the bottom of the ocean is so mysterious that many people even doubt its existence and people who tried to take it out lost there lives but our protagonist SagarSanjay Dutt sleepwalks his way through the ocean and finds out the treasure just like that. Either he is a combination of Columbus and Sherlock Holmes or the director and his team of writers were too busy thinking about the cinematography part that they forgot about the minor details in the story.Talking about the so called surprise ending of the film the only surprise you will get is that you'll notice that most people are actually laughing at what had to be a serious moment in the film Unintentional Laughs arise universally.The second highlight of the movie is Lara Dutta who is looking like a zilliongazillion bucks she rules the waves and many a hearts too. The perfect eye candy.The cinematography is top grade but under that glossy finish lies a decomposed chunk of wood that is being eaten by termites and at the end what is left is that glossy finish with a BIG HOLE inside.The music is average although some notes are easy on the ears but still considering A.R. Rahman is the music and background score director the music is disappointing and so is the film.And don't get me started on the script like Akshay's previous outing Kambakkht Ishq the script is Missing. Although at some points in the movie you feel like there's a decent script developing but as soon as you think that the director puts all your doubts aside and comes up with another blow up.With holes that BIG even the unsinkable Titanic sank and sadly so does Blue but with the sinking it stinks too.I go for  12 out of five for director Anthony D'Souza's BlueAn opportunity lost this film made me wonder why am I even reviewing it.Under all that gloss lies a BIG HOLE that takes Blue down that smelly drainpipe which hasn't been cleaned since the medieval ages.Watch it only when someone threatens to kill you for not watching it.".

Either he is a combination of Columbus and Sherlock Holmes or the director and his team of writers were too busy thinking about the cinematography part that they forgot about the minor details in the story.Talking about the so called surprise ending of the film the only surprise you will get is that you'll notice that most people are actually laughing at what had to be a serious moment in the film Unintentional Laughs arise universally.The second highlight of the movie is Lara Dutta who is looking like a zilliongazillion bucks she rules the waves and many a hearts too. The perfect eye candy.The cinematography is top grade but under that glossy finish lies a decomposed chunk of wood that is being eaten by termites and at the end what is left is that glossy finish with a BIG HOLE inside.The music is average although some notes are easy on the ears but still considering A.R. Rahman is the music and background score director the music is disappointing and so is the film.And don't get me started on the script like Akshay's previous outing Kambakkht Ishq the script is Missing. Although at some points in the movie you feel like there's a decent script developing but as soon as you think that the director puts all your doubts aside and comes up with another blow up.With holes that BIG even the unsinkable Titanic sank and sadly so does Blue but with the sinking it stinks too.I go for  12 out of five for director Anthony D'Souza's BlueAn opportunity lost this film made me wonder why am I even reviewing it.Under all that gloss lies a BIG HOLE that takes Blue down that smelly drainpipe which hasn't been cleaned since the medieval ages.Watch it only when someone threatens to kill you for not watching it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Blue directed by Anthony D'souza is a brainless forgettable actionthriller that quickly sinks without a trace. Let me say this right away anyone expecting anything other than the sight of Lara Dutta in a skimpy bikini or indeed Akshay Kumar with his shirt off is going to be very disappointed. The film's harebrained plot involves a coveted treasure buried at the bottom of the ocean and a reluctant Sanjay Dutt playing Sagar a working class regularJoe in the Bahamas who refuses to seek it out even though he seems to be the only diver in the world who knows where and how to find it. No amount of coaxing from his friend and employer Aarav played by Akshay Kumar will do the trick. But the outofshape Dutt  whose unsightly manboobs suggest he's been bunking too many sessions at the gym  finally agrees to take the plunge when his kidbrother's life depends on it. Sam played by Zayed Khan wearing a single expression throughout is in trouble with some goons who must be paid 50 million immediately. For a film that's titled Blue most of the action here involves bike chases and car explosions while the underwater portions are gorgeously filmed but evoke no real excitement. To be honest in fact the tension never heightens to the point where you worry about the protagonists. How can you when you notice even the sharks are swimming peacefully around them oblivious and uninterested even when underwater brawls result in blood being spilt! Blue suffers from a dull script and inane dialogue and is cursed with characters that are as shallow as the waters they paddle. You want to burst into laughs when Lara Dutta playing Sagar's girlfriend Mona slips into Miss India mode and complains that they have no money to realise her one dream of setting up a marine research facility. The lady does not show so much as a passing interest in fish by the way! Coming back to the business of the buried fortune let's just say we've all participated in school treasurehunts that were more challenging than this one. We're told the fortune hasn't been retrieved in 60 years and yet Sagar leads the way to the loot as if it's lying in his backyard. Neither slick nor fastpaced this film lumbers in circles before crashing into a moronic finale involving ridiculous backstories about dead family members. In the end despite its travelbrochure look that might afford some momentary National Geographicstyle relief Blue doesn't have a shred of intelligence and it sinks in a sea of lame writing and laughable performances. Sanjay Dutt sleepwalks through his scenes and Akshay Kumar overdoes the smugness. As for Zayed Khan how I wish the makers had spent the fee they paid him to hire a few more sharks and include a few more thrills instead. The music by AR Rahman is strictly average even the item song by Kyle Minogue can't save this film from reaching its watery grave.Director Anthony D'souza's Blue's has flashy exterior and it's one dead fish. Watch it strictly at your own risk.".

The soul of the film is missing IMO. And whatever is offered is very much predictable. I mean if you are stunned by the twists in the movie then you have not seen enough thriller movies. Even the movie Race had shocking twists than Blue. My college friends were all the time busy in predicting what will happen next and most of the times they were right. Good things about the movie was the cinematography and the breathtaking visuals. It is visually a brilliant movie. The BGM was disappointing. Not expected from Rahman Sir. Akshay Kumar and Sanjay Dutt were the saviors of the movie. No one can beat Akshay in such roles. Lara was there just to shed clothes and be the damsel in distress. Katrina Kaif's Special appearance had more impact than Lara's main role. Zayed Khan did the same thing what he had being doing since his debut Curse that day . I did not understand the reason for the Kylie song in the movie They could have just done a promotional song with her that plays at the end credits. Overall watch it for it's style glamor action  But if you are looking for good story you will be disappointed.Rating  510".

	schema:reviewBody "If I may broadly categorize Bollywood films into two camps. One the original works which might even extend to remakes of films from the other regions in the subcontinent but seldom seen outside of it. The masala formula would work its magic into creating an entertaining tale filled with a song and dance extravaganza. Then the other would be the stitching together of elements from other films seldom referred to as paying homage or acknowledged if at all and trying to pass them off as originals. These tend to be predictable and plainly concealing a bad if nonexistent story. Blue unfortunately falls into the latter category.I had originally wanted to watch this on the big screen given its tooting of the horn that it's the first to feature stunning underwater photography in a Bollywood action film. But the result here for an actioner is something that left much to be desired. While references to Into The Blue can be discounted by virtue of it being just another treasure hunter movie set in the high seas the other sequences here were something that you would have seen before from boring MI2 motorcycle chase scenes the Bourne Ultimatum for fisticuffs on board a boat to the one that takes the cake involving a gunfight that was a lift out from Bad Boys 2.Lines were also found lifted from films like Hitch but thankfully this was kept to a minimum. Set in the Bahamas with locations like Thailand also included this film dwells on the search for the missing sunken ship Lady in Blue which is said to contain treasures beyond a man's widest dreams. A simple carefree fisherman Sagar Sanjay Dutt holds key to the location of the ship given a diving expedition with his dad when young which resulted in a tragedy. His good friend rich playboy Aarav Akshay Kumar desires that Sagar would come to his senses and make them both richer but to Sagar it's a secret that he would bring to the grave.Enter Sagar's reckless brother Sam Zayed Khan who's being pursued by thugs all the way from Thailand for a sum of 50 million dollars that he owes and you know just what the solution is for our reluctant Sagar. As mentioned the film got made through the stringing of action sequences one after another with room for some romance between Sagar and Mona Lara Dutta and Sam and Nikki Katrina Kaif in a short supporting role but the much touted underwater action scenes turn out to be nothing more than a drop in the ocean much of it against faceless thugs who seem to appear quite conveniently to challenge our testosterone filled trio.There's a nice twist to the story about families which gave the weak story some sense but alas this was too little too late as the finale was one hurried affair that seemed more like a haphazardly inserting a coda just for the sake of damage having already been made by the uninspiring action and plot. If only it had taken time to further develop the characters beyond their cardboard caricatures which would have made it all the more palatable in terms of story rather than to stick its guns to the action which were cobbled from films made in the West.".

What really triggered my interest was an underwater thriller a first for Bollywood. However the underwater thrills I was anticipating were missing. The exciting plot and main developments that could have made for great sequences were pretty much narrated by the characters. If I'm being told the story then why am I watching the movie?? The treasure hunt seemed too easy. I thought the sharks would have an interesting role but I was disappointed to just see them swimming around. It would have been much more gripping had Akshay turned out to be the villain and started attacking Sanjay in the ocean. One thing is for sure though the cinematography is fantastic! Not only were the Bahamas and Bangkok captured beautifully but the underwater shots were phenomenal! Even if not used for thrills at least we got to see breathtaking visuals of the ocean layer. Music is not baddefinitely not Rahman's best but still nice. Aaj Dil along with the Blue buhlue? Theme are the best. Others are OK. Lara is always great and so was Katrina. Sanjay gave a great performance. I can't stand Akshay but he always performs passionately. Zayed is a terrible actor while Kylie was useless.Blue was a very ambitious project and gotta give the guy credit for taking on such a challenging and different concept. The promos were misleading and the film did not put enough emphasis on underwater thriller scenes. The script could've been much more interesting and convincing. At least it was a slightly different fare thanks to a fresh though not ideal cast ensemble jazzy music a few good action scenes and eyepopping cinematography.".

What the hey man! I can not believe this movie made 6 Crores rupees on first day. Nothing underwater is shot it looks like scene were shot in swimming pool. Very unrealistic and unbelievable. people are not that dumb dude... stop fooling them. Only blue in this movie was Sanjay Dutt and his belly. I mean where the hey is your six pack man? Guy has got some belly nowadays you can tell even if you are sleeping while watching the movie. I would not pay my money to see the Dutt belly. I mean we used to look up to him as a fittest dude in past. How the hey a producer spend Crores of Rs after this SShitt? I must say that this movie was the worst i have seen in 2009. Many of the scenes are stolen from Discovery Channel's documentary. One may be two songs were good even AR could not help this movie. Come on dude you just won Oscar we expect lot from you. Don't give this kinda music. I mean it was good to see Lara in couple of clothes but its just Lara not worth that much. Katrina for 6 minutes can not help movie. Kylie can Chiggy Wiggy may be but WTH with that. All this and on top of you guys bring Zayed khan in this movie? WORST MOVIE OF AKSHAY KUMAR. How dare you insult your audience like this? He is the worst actor and most flopped in industry. What the hey with story ? I could have given you better story. Stop trying to imitate DHOOM movie by using unrealistic BIKE scenes. BORING....

What the hey man! I can not believe this movie made 6 Crores rupees on first day. Nothing underwater is shot it looks like scene were shot in swimming pool. Very unrealistic and unbelievable. people are not that dumb dude... stop fooling them. Only blue in this movie was Sanjay Dutt and his belly. I mean where the hey is your six pack man? Guy has got some belly nowadays you can tell even if you are sleeping while watching the movie. I would not pay my money to see the Dutt belly. I mean we used to look up to him as a fittest dude in past. How the hey a producer spend Crores of Rs after this SShitt? I must say that this movie was the worst i have seen in 2009. Many of the scenes are stolen from Discovery Channel's documentary. One may be two songs were good even AR could not help this movie. Come on dude you just won Oscar we expect lot from you. Don't give this kinda music. I mean it was good to see Lara in couple of clothes but its just Lara not worth that much. Katrina for 6 minutes can not help movie. Kylie can Chiggy Wiggy may be but WTH with that. All this and on top of you guys bring Zayed khan in this movie? WORST MOVIE OF AKSHAY KUMAR. How dare you insult your audience like this? He is the worst actor and most flopped in industry. What the hey with story ? I could have given you better story. Stop trying to imitate DHOOM movie by using unrealistic BIKE scenes. BORING.... BOOOO..... Where the hey is an entertainment? FOLKS I AM TELLING YOU ALL DO NOT SPEND A DIME FROM YOUR POCKET TO WATCH THIS MOVIE. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU DID. very disappointing movie.";

Next time these guys see an Indian actor riding on a horse they will conclude that that particular scene or perhaps the whole movie is a copy of a Hollywood Western.And so what if it is inspired by Hollywood movies? Finally it's the result that counts. I like this movie because of it's great picturization! And Yes the story could have been better but it's not that bad eighter. Nevertheless I've seen a good composed story and enjoyed with a lot of popcorn. High standards of cinema are achieved despite the thin storyline. The last motorbike chase is really awesome. It's stunning composition generates a huge adrenaline boost for the viewer. And the underwater scenes where accompanied by such a nice music score. Yas Raj should learn from this movie how to use background music. A.R. Rahman has proved his versatility as music composor he has produced very beautiful music for this movie. This man is an Artist! And Kiley's performance is super diva! The minor point in the story line is the anticlimax at the end. Akshay as a nice villain who needs to be hugged and his motive to save the family honor disappoints big time. But thank god they spoiled only these last 5 minutes of the movie. I would rather see a more creative plot with a edge of my seat mean dirty rude and crude result.Despite the lack in content but due to it's high visuals and powerful action scenes this movie has repetitive value so I will watch it again. The time for ''Pyaar ke Bokhaar'' love fever movies has passed it's now time for movies like Dhoom Don and Blue!".

	schema:reviewBody "They had at least some plot that a Manmohan Desai or Subhash Ghai would have shot into a catchy movie but instead of shooting it they spoke it in last 10 minutes of the film. So you get the story as Sanjay Dutt speaks about his dad Akshay speaks about his dad Gulshan speaks about his partnership with Akshay and you wonder that they couldn't have run out of money the costliest film they didn't run out of time less than 2 hours. When interval happens at 1 hour I hear several gasps of arey interval ho bhi gaya they couldn't have date problems as none of the personalities is really busy they why the heck they didn't shoot it.So it is about a treasure hunt. If you think you might be able to remember that Titanic itself was about a treasure hunt actually the blue diamond but you have almost forgotten that part is the ultimate tribute to Cameroon that this treasure chase was running just as a thin line in background while one of the most finely told love story unfolded on the screen.Kat being wifey of Akshay brought a lot of laughs from the audience as if they had stopped counting the plot goofups but we do wonder why at all Katrina accepted to do this movie for such a wafer thin role. Zayed knows she is working for Gulshan She already knew that Zayed is going to Bahamas still he puts all blond jokes to shame by dropping a voice message to her cell telling her that he is in Bahamas for Gulshan to hear and even then feels safe hiding there and showing surprise when gulshan reaches there.Bahamas is near Mexico and Cuba how does a ship coming from UK to India reach their is the biggest unrevealed mystery of the film.Akshay's character portrayal is utterly confused. he was a good friend to begin with though you wonder how can someone just spend his entire life befriending Sanjay Dutt just for the treasure while womenising greedily but leaving him at being the real manipulator the real villain would still have been consistent and had brought some twist but then he comes out to be the grandson of the captain and gives entire treasure to government to clear family name and even puts the 20 award legally received from government to Sanjay Dutt. What the heck is happening.It also didn't become clear why Gulshan breaks to tell Sanjay Zayed about the secret partnership he was having with Akshay. And the allegation that Akshay wanted to keep entire treasure for himself also didn't stick as Askhay didn't want that money at all.Further if Akshay had just told Sanjay in the very beginning that he wanted to find the treasure and give it to the government to clear family name there is good possibility that Sanjay would have agreed to do so. Then the movie needn't have to be made.And when Gulshan tells it Sanjay just believes him forgetting his old friendship with Akshay. It seems so odd.When Akshay supposedly dies in the see they didn't even search for his body nor for his bike under the sea nor even inquire about what happens to Akshay's business and property after all Sanjay was an employee of Akshay.And why Akshay had to remain hidden from them for 3 months at the end has been provided no reason.And After Gulshan got killed and Akshay supposedly died why didn't Sanjay and Zayed and Lara try to bring the treasure for themselves. Sanjay and Zayed were unemployed now and Lara needed some money or they themselves could have given the treasure to the government. Why Sanjay Dutt had not provided the treasure details to the government all his life has also not been told.If entire thing was just a make believe to trap Zayed to force Sanjay to reveal the treasure then it looks a sickening waste that so many real guys get killed in bike chase in New York and Bahamas chasing Zayed and so many vehicles got destroyed and lives of the people in those vehicles too.Akshay and Sanjay look more like fathers to Lara Katrina and Kylie thus the body display scenes of ladies didn't really fume. Zayed was coolly young but it is surprising that with a spoilt single brat life he was supposed to be living how come he gets so much captivated by Katrina She looks elder and quite fatty to Zayed sorry Kat fans in 12 hours to behave like being in love. And then he was left without any partner in the visual treats of Bahamas. Why did they make Akshay flirt with Kylie when they could have made Kylie a mate for Zayed till the end of the movie.The songs didn't add to the film but they didn't hinder the film either. Songs go unnoticed. Yaar Mila Tha is not there. I couldn't figure where at all it could have been put. The entire lyrics the feel of the songs the situation doesn't fit on any character at all in the film. Film didn't have any emotionintensive scenes at all so no specific song was really needed for it. The great emotions that ARR had so laboriously put in some songs really served no purpose for the film.Chiggy Wiggy happens just like that it deserved a big build up but no. They just visit any hotel just spot one of so many a girls who happens to be Kylie and the dance starts and then Kylie disappears from the film. Such treatment will scare away all other foreign celebrities from bollywood. V S Rawat".

Or Lara's line of bikinis get yours today etc. etc. Anthony D'Souza needs to apologise to everybody who saw this film.I have finally figured out what the problem with Lara Dutta is she is too comfortable in fluffy roles she does not even try to challenge herself nor does she want to. And as for Kylie Minogue I can't even begin to tell you how shocked I was to see her like that. I cannot talk too much about her because I know she just went through breast cancer treatment and only God knows what she is going through personally. I just did not expect to see her face all pulled back and botoxed up like Nicole Kidman. Do they think because they live far away down under we wouldn't notice the surgery and injections? The less said about her trying to dance like Beyoncefrom her video of 'Upgrade you' the better.That aside this movie was so shockingly lackluster the only good thing about it was the song compositions by AR Rahman and the exotic locales of The Bahamas and Bangkok. Katrina Kaif should have said no to her cameothe minute she showed up I figured the stupid plot but of course she thought the film was going to be a hit that's why she couldn't help herself.".

The tapori style of Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi is just too good. Sunil Dutt has acted after a really really long time of 17 years. Gracy Singh is graceful and sweet. Boman Irani has done a good job as a Strict Dean of the medical college who accidentally believes in Laughter therapy. Although the punchline of the movie says He might just cure you forget about the curing he will surely make you laugh!! Truly Amazing Humour!! Rating 45".

He doesn't get along well with the dean of the college. He is also in love with his daughter Gracy Singh. The story now focuses on how people in the hospital need to be loved and appreciated. Arshad Warsi provides humour after every few scenes. Songs weren't that great except I really liked the Subah Ho Gayi Mamu.Sanjay Dutt does justification to his role as the Bhai. Arshad Warsi in the supporting role has acted very well. His role in this reminded me a movie he had done earlier  Tere Mere Sapne.".

But where you really have to give director the full points is that he saw the comedic talents of the junior Dutt and put them into a simplistic well made movie. All the characters be it Circuit Arshad Warsi or the Dean or  Sunil Dutt have been portrayed well enough in the movie. Some of the scenes like the one where Sanjay Dutt rags the seniors make you laugh out from the heart because this is something which every fresher in the college dreams of.

	schema:reviewBody "Inspired by the Hollywood movie 'Patch Adam' 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' tells the comedic story of a thug who wants to become a doctor. The film has its major share of comedic moments and its dramatic moments. It is indeed an entertaining film with the famously lovable characters like Munnabhai and Circuit. Rajkumar Hirani may have taken the idea of an older outsider wanting to become a doctor from 'Patch Adams' but in essence 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' is its own film and it is the performances and comedy that make it worth the watch because most the dramatic moments are a little over the top. While the dialogue in the comedic scenes are witty and hilarious the ones in the dramatic scenes are a mess.Sanjay Dutt totally nails Munnabhai. It's hard to picture anyone else in the title role. The actor does full justice. It was nice to see Sunil Dutt after a long time and that too as father to his own son. The actor has a strong presence even in a brief role. Gracy Singh is cute and adorable. Jimmy Shergill is awesome and holds his own as Zaheer and Boman Irani too does very well. However it is Arshad Warsi who steals the show in a breakthrough performance as one of the most memorable film characters of recent time Circuit.Most of the songs are well balanced and are good additions to the film. I found Munnabhai's romantic ballad hilarious when he tries to convince the suicider to cut the crap. On the technical side it's alright. On the whole this is one enjoyable flick. One would have expected more from the second Munnabhai film which I found boring but why should that prevent the pleasure that comes from this movie?".

	schema:reviewBody "They say laughter is the best medicine so here comes Dr. Murli Prasad Sharma to cure you. He may not be the brightest he may not be the most polite hell he may not even be an actual doctor but he will put a smile on your face and make you forget all your problems. So if you haven't seen the tactics of Munnabhai then forget your problems for 2 and half hours and treat yourself to his funny and endearing classic.Murli Prasad Sharma aka Munnabhai is a gangster who claims to be a social worker. He ran away from his village years ago to make a life in Mumbai. However he ended up becoming a goon who lives with the a lie he told his parents. He's a doctor. So once every year Munna's parents come to see their doctor son and his clinic full of small time cons who pose as other doctorspatient. One circumstance leads to another and Munna's parents come to find out his real identify due to Dr. Asthana. A shattered and disappointed father Hari Prasad Sharma leaves Munnaa in anger.A Munna full of shame is now destined to become a real doctor and so begins a tale of laughter emotions and important lessons in life.When i initially saw the promos of this movie I wasn't really interested. I was more interested in watching a star studded dud named L.O.C. Kargil which came the same month. I expected Munnabhi MBBS to be a slapstick comedy with no logic whatsoever.Firstly there is no silly comedy in this movie. The lines are fresh some are make your chuckle and some turn you in tears. The situations are fresh and nothing is forced. The very first scenes catch your eye and put a smile on your face.Sanju kidnapping the man in the first scene Sunil Dutt scene at the railway station the act put up by Sanju in front of his parents. You're just 15 minutes into the film and you're laughing out loud. The sequences in the hospital only get funnier.The film is a comedy but does not shy of trying to touch your emotions and it succeeds big time. Sunil Dutt confronting his son is heartbreaking to watch. Sanju's scenes with Jimmy Shergill is brilliant.The music is situational so it isn't conventional in any way. Although the songs are different they're good for the most part. The title song Dekh Le Chan Chan etc all go well with the screenplay and are soothing to the ears. There may not be a chartbuster in the soundtrack but the songs are still good.The writing is just brilliant. No loopholes in the script. No dip in the screenplay. Characters are fully developed. Raju Hirani's story is fresh.Another highpoint  Abbas Tyrewala's dialogues. Just outrageous. They are funny and not a bit over the top. The emotion filled dialogues are perfect too.Gracy Singh Jimmy Shergill Krush Debo etc all lend great support. It was a pleasure watching Sunil Dutt with Sanju.Baman Irani is a great talent and I'm sure he would agree with me that this movie boosted his acting career. He's hilarious. A brilliant act! Murli Prasad Sharma would not be what he is without his sidekick Circuit played by Arshad Warsi. Arshad is a scene stealer. His best act yet. This role was a turning point for Arshad.Now to Sanjay Dutt. Before Munnabhia Sanju was doing mediocre movies and mediocre roles. He hadn't give a box office hit in ages. Munnabhi MBBS is Sanjay Dutt's role. He was born to play the character and nobody can do it better than him. Not SRK not Aamir  NOBODY! Although these people mentioned above are a huge part of the movie none of them deserve more credit than the real hero of this masterpiece.Before naming him I'd like to thank Vidhu Vinod Chopra for finding this guy. Yes I'm talking about Indian cinema's current best filmmaker  Raj Kumar Hirani.This is Raju's film and no one can deny it. A perfectly directed movie and a novel idea. Hats off to this guy who gave 2 more classics after this movie. Lage Raho Munnabhai  3 Idiots What is there left to say? Just watch it enjoy it and watch it again. I know you will!".

	onyx:emotionText "They say laughter is the best medicine so here comes Dr. Murli Prasad Sharma to cure you. He may not be the brightest he may not be the most polite hell he may not even be an actual doctor but he will put a smile on your face and make you forget all your problems. So if you haven't seen the tactics of Munnabhai then forget your problems for 2 and half hours and treat yourself to his funny and endearing classic.Murli Prasad Sharma aka Munnabhai is a gangster who claims to be a social worker. He ran away from his village years ago to make a life in Mumbai. However he ended up becoming a goon who lives with the a lie he told his parents. He's a doctor. So once every year Munna's parents come to see their doctor son and his clinic full of small time cons who pose as other doctorspatient. One circumstance leads to another and Munna's parents come to find out his real identify due to Dr. Asthana. A shattered and disappointed father Hari Prasad Sharma leaves Munnaa in anger.A Munna full of shame is now destined to become a real doctor and so begins a tale of laughter emotions and important lessons in life.When i initially saw the promos of this movie I wasn't really interested. I was more interested in watching a star studded dud named L.O.C. Kargil which came the same month. I expected Munnabhi MBBS to be a slapstick comedy with no logic whatsoever.Firstly there is no silly comedy in this movie. The lines are fresh some are make your chuckle and some turn you in tears. The situations are fresh and nothing is forced. The very first scenes catch your eye and put a smile on your face.Sanju kidnapping the man in the first scene Sunil Dutt scene at the railway station the act put up by Sanju in front of his parents.

I think the Mafia could learn something about softening their strong arm approach by using a term like that. The other idea that came across rather successfully was the concept of a Magic Hug. That was reinforced a few times throughout the story for a positive effect. Other reviewers here on IMDb mention the American film Patch Adams as the basis for the story line in this picture but not having seen it the thought that came to my mind was another Hindi film  3 Idiots. In that picture the message that came across was about believing in one's self and doing what you really want to do with your life. In this one Murli Prasad 'Munna Bhai' Sharma is shamed by his past and decides to make his family proud by becoming a doctor instead of pretending to be one. Additionally as regards 3Idiots there's also the conflicted relationship between Murli and the dean of his medical colllege who's daughter serves as a romantic interest for the exgangster.The film's best moments appear whenever Murli's unorthodox humanistic and compassionate side reveals itself as in his treatment of the near comatose wheelchair patient Anand Yatin Karyekar. His ability to make friends with everyone he comes in contact with serves him well when the Dean attempts to formally rusticate him from medical school. You know there was only one way for this story to end and it does with plenty of magic hugs to go around.".

A goon with a kind heart creates difference.The film is obvious drama with lot of loop holes but since its a comedy and has so many unforgettable punches of logic that its highly respectable. Such kind of movies are not for comparison they are to abide by and understood with heart and not the brain.";

	schema:reviewBody "When Loretta Young beat out Rosalind Russell in the Academy Award sweepstakes of 1947 it was considered one of the great upsets in the history of Oscar. Russell had gotten a lot of acclaim for her dramatic breakthrough performance in Mourning Becomes Electra which was RKO's prestige picture of the year. The O'Neill drama flopped at the box office. Young was nominated almost as an afterthought to round out the field in 1947. Of course RKO didn't care because The Farmer's Daughter was also one of their films.Young worked hard to get her proper Swedish accent for the film and the results would have made Greta Garbo proud. I can't see Garbo appearing in a film like The Farmer's Daughter though.Young plays Katie Holstrum who leaves the family farm to study nursing and in an almost Forrest Gump like set of circumstances winds up working as a maid in Congressman Joseph Cotten's home. She's not working for just Cotten. Presiding over the home and the state of Minnesota itself is Cotten's mother Ethel Barrymore. Ethel's not only queen of her own roost but she's a Senator's widow and still one formidable power in her state of Minnesota. And there's Charles Bickford the family butler who got an Oscar nomination himself in this film for Best Supporting Actor as Young's gruff but kindly mentor.Although at the time this film was made Young was 34 years old she does manage to convey youth here. It worked in this case because in 1947 a lot of people were starting their careers late. It's pointed out in the story that she stayed on the family farm while her beefcake brothers James Arness Keith Andes and Lex Barker were all in the service during World War II.A long running television series was adapted from this film with the tragic Inger Stevens in the lead and William Windom in Cotten's role. Cathleen Nesbitt was the grande political dame. The butler's role was dropped and Windom was made a widower with two boys. Even with a genuine Swede like Stevens playing Katie Young still comes out the better.Too bad Rosalind Russell never got an Oscar but Loretta Young was one of the great survivors of Hollywood and her award was as much an award for a lifetime as for the still fresh and funny The Farmer's Daughter.".

	schema:headline " Poignant story";
	schema:reviewBody "Not having seen the movie before it was a complete surprise to watch it on cable the other night. This film shows that little if nothing ever changes in the world of politics. In fact it could well be compared to this year's presidential contest. The only thing that has changed from the time where this film was done is that in order to win an election in this country the candidate must be independently wealthy or have benefactors that are willing to put up the money in exchange of favors down the line or not be able to run at all.H. C. Potter's film shows us a slice of what on the surface was an ideal time in America during the 40s but deep down this film speaks a lot of what was wrong then in a subtle way. Young Katrin Holstrom arrives in Capital City wanting to be a nurse. She has to change plans because when she arrives in the city she has no money because an unscrupulous man had swindled her out of it. She begins working as a maid at the Morley's mansion. They are the local big name in politics. Mrs. Morley makes candidates or destroys them. Her own son Glenn is a Congressman.All this atmosphere contributes to the growth of Katrin or Katie as she is called. She takes an interest in politics and she shows that she can speak and ask the right questions the candidates don't want to answer. The movie shows the dirty side of campaigns in general as is the case of with what's happening in 2004 in America. Loretta Young was perfect as Katrin Halstrom. In this film she out charms everyone that she comes in contact with. Joseph Cotten is as effective as she always was in whatever he appeared in. Ethel Barrymore is Agatha the rich woman behind the political machine. Charles Bickford is also excellent as Joseph the butler.Most movies from that period are sadly dated but this one keeps the ideals of democracy in check. Bravo to Dory Schary for bringing this movie to the screen.".

	onyx:emotionText "Not having seen the movie before it was a complete surprise to watch it on cable the other night. This film shows that little if nothing ever changes in the world of politics. In fact it could well be compared to this year's presidential contest. The only thing that has changed from the time where this film was done is that in order to win an election in this country the candidate must be independently wealthy or have benefactors that are willing to put up the money in exchange of favors down the line or not be able to run at all.H. C. Potter's film shows us a slice of what on the surface was an ideal time in America during the 40s but deep down this film speaks a lot of what was wrong then in a subtle way. Young Katrin Holstrom arrives in Capital City wanting to be a nurse. She has to change plans because when she arrives in the city she has no money because an unscrupulous man had swindled her out of it. She begins working as a maid at the Morley's mansion. They are the local big name in politics. Mrs. Morley makes candidates or destroys them. Her own son Glenn is a Congressman.All this atmosphere contributes to the growth of Katrin or Katie as she is called. She takes an interest in politics and she shows that she can speak and ask the right questions the candidates don't want to answer. The movie shows the dirty side of campaigns in general as is the case of with what's happening in 2004 in America. Loretta Young was perfect as Katrin Halstrom. In this film she out charms everyone that she comes in contact with. Joseph Cotten is as effective as she always was in whatever he appeared in. Ethel Barrymore is Agatha the rich woman behind the political machine. Charles Bickford is also excellent as Joseph the butler.Most movies from that period are sadly dated but this one keeps the ideals of democracy in check. Bravo to Dory Schary for bringing this movie to the screen.";

He proceeds to stand up and yell Fish for Sale and the entire auditorium roars with unequivocal approval.And what acting down to the minutest part. Loretta Young deservedly won best actress. Charles Bickford was nominated and should have won best supporting actor. He stands tall above them all and competition is heavy in this flick. You have to be on your toes to out act the likes of Ethel Barrymore and Joseph Cotten two of the finest acting talents ever but Loretta Young and Charles Bickford succeed in doing just that.This is one of those pictures that Hollywood used to make that is fun from start to finish with surprising twists and turns from time to time. Though all comes out well in the finish getting there is worth the journey. Plus this happy ending fits and is not just tacked on for custom and tradition.

The rest of the cast give nicely tuned performance with no real hamming from anyone which in the case of Ethel Barrymore as the family matriarch is somewhat surprising as she tended to overdo it with her eyes and that patrician voicebut not here. Joseph Cotten's natural good natured goofiness works well in the film and like Miss Barrymore he reins himself in more than usual here. Charles Bickford as the butler is fine also. The best performance in the movie for my money though is that of Rhys Williams as an amorous and amoral housepainter who is also the villain of the piece. Director Hank Potter paces the film well and the sets are excellently designed and beautiful to behold especially that of the main house. There's a lot of surface intelligence in the movie if not much real braininess despite near the end its attempt to wring some Capraesque meaning from its slight story. A very good but not great film this one's worth seeing for what passed for upper echelon if not quite top of the line entertainment a half century or more ago.".

This attractive BW classic satire stars Joseph Cotten as her handsome politico boss Ethel Barrymore as his understanding mother and an outstanding cast who support their political and romantic involvements. But Katie Holstrom does not begin this film as a candidate nor anyone's fiance she begins it on a farm with her large family with a plan to go to school as a nurse in the big city.What happens next is she leaves and within one day has been bilked of her savings. The need for a job drives her to seek employment as housemaid to a Congressman Glenn Morley played by Cotten and his mother. Ethel Barrymore. Under the house majordomo Charles Bickford she proves herself to be possessed of charm common sense lively intelligence and honestyqualities which please well when they are not exasperating her employers unused to such qualities in a world of politicians. Katrin and Glenn find themselves attracted despite his having a fiance Rose Hobart. But when the party's candidate for Congress has to be dumped it is Katie who somehow gets chosen to run and wins. The film's climax is Katie's victory the ending is the romantic pair's arrival in Washington. The values of this award winning films are not hidden ones. Milton S. Krasner cinematography sets by Darrell Silvers and Harley Miller  Edith Head's costumes and many more contribute to the overall effect. The lighting throughout is like a sunny outdoors and the actors are outstanding. Along with the leads the director H.C. Potter featured Harry Shannon and Anna Q. Nilsson as Katie's parents Lex Barker James Arness and Keith Andes as her brawny brothers Art Baker Rhys Williams William Harrigan Tom Powers Thurston Hall and many others. The script by Allen Rivin and Laura Kerr adapts Juhani Tervap's delightful play seamlessly to the screen. The film's pace is interestingly steady and unhurried its dialogue good or better at all points. The theme of the plot it to be true to oneself and the story develops this in terms of a time when an individual could be offered as a candidate on the basis of hisher attributes not of inherited millions. As refreshing as a summer breeze and often as delightful. This is a classic of anti Establishment thinking that is only occasionally political at all. Dservedly popular achievement.".

This is not just a sentimental little vehicle for Loretta Young and Joe Cotton. It is that of course and a delightful one. But it also happens to be a subversive political and feminist manifesto.Oh really?First check out the timing. It was made in 1947 the year the House UnAmerican Activities Committee started rampaging though Hollywood looking for Commie witches and subversive agendas. They need have looked no further than this movie but as far as I know they missed it too. Loretta Young got an Academy Award.Second check out the producer. Dore Schary was notorious for opposing the activities of the HUAC and the Hollywood blacklist. Though I don't think he was ever officially blacklisted he was certainly outspoken and was frequently painted with a red brush.Third check out the issues Katie raises in her campaign a living wage for American workers an end to exploiting common people the right to protest and speak out. And underlying it all the unspoken admonition to pay attention to what these guys on the podium are actually saying don't just cheer and follow. All stuff that would have gotten her blacklisted if anybody was paying attention.Fourth check out the guy she was campaigning against spoiler? who turns out to be a figurehead for a secret right wing group that wants to make sure everybody is on the right White? asks Mrs. Morely pointedly page. He's booted unceremoniously from the Morely parlor.And finally here's the main spoiler check out what happens to her. A sappy romantic comedy would have ended in the chicken yard with Glenn saving her from ignominy by marrying her and whisking her away with him to Washington. She gets to Washington all right and she's his wife. But that's not the only way she gets there.This movie was a delightfully subversive thumb in the eye of the forces of darkness in 1947 Hollywood. And the forces of darkness were too buy mooning over Loretta Young to get it.Remake anyone?".

One reviewer pointed out that Rosalind Russell was the presumed favorite but relative newcomer Susan Hayward's performance in SMASH UP was exceptional and truly deserved the Oscar watch this filmyou'll see what I mean. As for Young she was amusing to watch but also a bit embarrassing with her silly Swedish accent which at times she forgot to employ. Plus her role was so slight and lightweight that I just can't understand the committee's decision to award her the statuette for such an ordinary performance. There I said it...now on to the film itself.THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER was a cute little comedy about a nice lady Young from the country that moves to the city and becomes the maid to a US congressman Joseph Cotton and his mother Ethel Barrymore. Because she is such a nice bright and hardworking lady Young is almost instantly accepted into the family. Cotton in particular seems very taken with her and considering how sweet she is it didn't seem all that surprising.Quite unexpectedly in the middle of the film it is announced that another congressman has died and they need to have a special election to fill the post. Cotton and Barrymore are THE party machine for the state and they decide to put up a man who Young dislikes. At the rally to introduce this candidate Young is so annoyed at the nominee that she gets up and voices her concerns for his fitness. As a result she receives a lot of media attention and is soon tapped to be the candidate for the opposition partycreating quite a dilemma for Cotton and his party! There's a lot more to the film but the overall effort seems a lot like a comedic version of MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON.

It is something many of today's voters are painfully unaware of. In this day of apathy it is time for films such as these to be released and remind us of how wonderful this country is and how important a single vote is. It is a personal right a way of running our own government something that is woefully ignored in today's filmmaking.

	schema:headline " Marvelous story with nice masking of partisanship";
	schema:reviewBody "The Farmer's Daughter is a wonderful drama and love story laced throughout with humor. The setting is a fictitious state somewhere in the United States. The plot revolves around politics and congressional elections. But it is the story of a Swedish farm girl who comes to the city and by her natural charms solid upbringing and intelligence sweeps the people off their feet. Loretta Young was perfect for the part and her superb performance as Katrin Katie Holstrom won her the best actress Oscar in the 1947 Academy Awards. The entire cast performed superbly. Joseph Cotton plays the male lead Glenn Morley who is continuing a family tradition in politics. In the opening scenes he is winning his third term in the U.S. House of Representatives. Another Oscar winner and Hollywood legend Ethel Barrymore plays Agatha Morley Glenn's widow mother and wise matriarch of the family. Charles Bickford received the second of his three career Oscar nominations for his major supporting role as Joseph Clancy. He is a lifelong friend and companion of the deceased Senator Morley and runs the household as a friend and confidant to Agatha and Glenn.A number of other supporting actors give very fine performances. James Arness makes his screen debut here as one of Katie's brothers Peter. He is the future Marshal Matt Dillon of the longest running American TV series Gunsmoke 19551975. This film was released in late March 1947. Harry Truman was filling out the presidential term of Franklin D. Roosevelt who had died April 12 1945. There was more interest and participation in politics at the grassroots level. This film shows that and it also takes a stab at politics. The satire is aimed at cronyism and nepotism and the smear tactics sometimes used in dirty politics. But overall the film boasts of patriotism with some unashamed flag waving. RKO obviously wanted the film to be a hit. So the screenplay doesn't name political parties. And the setting is fictional perhaps even idyllic in its time. Let's see how cleverly RKO kept partisan politics out of a movie that is a lot about politics. First the locale. The outdoor scenes were shot near Petaluma California. The rolling hills and open spaces of the countryside could be in any one of most of the states West of the Mississippi River. Yet there also was a mountain lodge at Lake Kaluma a fictional name. It could be California but for one thing  the distance from Capital City to New York. Glenn tells his mother that he will be leaving for Europe at noon the next day from New York. And he has to be at the Capital City airport by 8 a.m. That would be about a threehour flight to New York. In the mid1940s Douglas DC4s and similar planes of the airlines cruised at 225 miles per hour. Flight times averaged much less than 200 mph. So Capital City couldn't be more than 600 miles from New York. Sacramento is 2500 miles away. Katie came from a Swedish farming community. Most of the Swedish immigration was in the upper Midwest Illinois to Montana. But the air distance from New York to Chicago is 715 miles. So those states are out.Some other factors also help make the state fictitious. The district in which Katie runs for Congress is the 13th. In 1947 10 states of 48 had 13 or more congressional districts and seats in the U.S. House. That eliminates 38 states. Four more were too far from New York  California 23 Illinois 25 Missouri 13 and Texas 21. The others were too close andor didn't have the Swedish population or the type of terrain in the movie  Massachusetts 14 Michigan 18 New Jersey 15 New York 45 Ohio 22 and Pennsylvania 33. Second the politics. There's no mention of chairmanships the ruling party in the House or ranking positions the minority party. Joseph names senators who gave testimonials on the senate floor about Woodrow Wilson after he died in 1924. Of course Sen. Morley was fictitious. But the others were real men  and a mix of Democrats and Republicans. Those included Robert M. La Follette Republican later Progressive from Wisconsin Carter Glass Democrat from Virginia Oscar Underwood Democrat from Alabama and Henry Cabot Lodge Republican from Massachusetts. Joseph also mentions Porter but there was no U.S. senator by that last name. It likely was Porter H. Dale Republican from Vermont.One thing about this film puzzles me. The ending scenarios clearly put down the Ku Klux Klan but the film never mentions it by name. Doubtless many people in modern times won't know the direct reference. Still this is a wonderful film for the plot and the acting. And it can be educational for children and adults in its look at how politics should be and shouldn't be.My favorite scenario is Katrin's answer to Mrs. Morley Agatha who asked What do you do Katrin? Katie says Well at home I do everything. Make six beds every morning. Do washing ironing for mamma papa my three brothers myself. Clean all seven rooms and do dishes of course. And I help mamma with the canning. I preserve meat candle eggs dill pickles smoke ham and bacon. I wait on tables  40 hands at harvest time. And I make glogg. Agatha You do? Katie Yah at Christmas time with a hot poker. You want to know what I do outside? Glenn I don't know about my mother but I'd be fascinated. Katie Well I plow with horse and tractor. I hoe potatoes shock wheat milk cows bed horses butcher pigs kill and dress chickens and I cut wood for mill and stove. Agatha You've got a job Katrin.".

As I have never cottoned to Cotten I will say nothing about his performance other than I wish someone else  anyone else  had been given the role. I never bought Cotton as an actor especially as a leading man. Ethel Barrymore is Cotten's politically savvy mother and the supporting cast is firstrate. The film could just as easily have been made in the 1930s as it has that era's feel. While it takes a simplistic view of Ame4rican politics it is still delightful to watch. The subsequent TV series with Inger Stevens was not nearly as interesting.".

It's a charming story in itself but I also loved the performances. Besides Young this movie also showcased Joseph Cotten as a romantic lead  a role I've never seen him in and Ethel Barrymore  a grande dame of stage and screen  is perfection in her role as a kingmaker. It's remarkable that all three actors managed to stand out without overshadowing each other.".

Loretta Young as immigrant farm girl Katie Holstrom plans to go to nursing school now that her brothers have returned from the armed services to help run their farm. But her plan is altered when the painter of their barn offers her a ride to her school saving her bus fare. But he has a bad idea with her wrecking his jeep in front of a motel so that they have to stay at the motel until his car is fixed. Since he is broke and has no insurance she must pay the damages to the other car. This takes all her money so after hitchhiking the rest of the way to school she immediately looks for a job as a maidwith no references. By luck she immediately gets a job as a maid for the wealthy politically influential Morley family consisting of the matriarch AgathaEthel Barrymore and her son and US congressman GlennJoseph Cotton. We don't discover their background but presumably the absent father wasis an important political figure leaving Agatha an important political powerbroker. Initially Katie is met by the house majordomo Joe ClanceyCharles Bickford. She initially planned to work only a few months to get back on her financial feet. However she is so talented at household chores they want her to stay longer. She gets involved with a political campaign to fill a congressional seat left vacant by the death of a local congressman. She digs up some shady dealings by the man favored by Agatha FinleyArt Bakerand tells them at a political rally. This catches the attention of the opposition party who decide to run her as their candidate. Of course Katie has no prior political experience so she runs on a platform of honest and fair dealing without bias toward financial supporters of her campaign. She champions certain liberal policies such as a living minimal wage. Presumably this would include unemployment insurance programs that support living prices for agricultural products the rights of organized labor and various safety net programs. She seems to have good practical organization skills as well. Finley her opponent says he believes in Americanism. By his he seems to mean policies that favor businesses the status quo smaller government footprint WASPSWhite AngloSaxon Protestants and which minimize welfare programs and opposes subversive political partiesCommunists included. Eventually it's realized that her platform encompasses some goals that both parties subscribe to hence she is endorsed by both parties and including Agatha. After it's revealed that Finley tried to smear her private reputation by false evidence she wins the race by a landslide. Along with the political aspects there is a growing romantic attraction between Katie and Glenn despite their sometimes political differences. There's even an exciting brawl between Glenn plus her 3 brothers vs. Finley's goons plus the painter.So what are the apparent take home messages?1Political campaigns should stress specific issues general philosophy and character rather than personal wealth or conformity to a political machine.2 Policies that promote the general welfare whether they involve strengthening or maintaining safety nets and livable wages or promotion of meaningful jobcreating businesses should be favored. 3Women even immigrants can make useful politicians. They are less likely to be involved in scandal or corruption tend to have more practical experience in certain specialties and tend to be more compassionate toward the disadvantaged and children issues. In 1947 when this film was released women made up only 1.52.0 of the House of Representatives and there were no women senators. As of the recent election women made up about 20 of both the House members and senators. This shows the great increase in women involved in national politics since this film was released.I'm not claiming that this increase was substantially promoted by this film.".

Honestly Loretta Young can really put on a half Swedish and half American accent. She's just so talented! Even Rhys Williams who played the stupid dope who ripped Katie off Adolph Petree he honestly knows how to put on an American accent for such an English bloke like him. I suppose if you saw Cary Grant with his movies you can hardly hear his English accent! Ah Rhys Williams was fantastic too for his role!

The first half is decent but nothing special although Cotten really steals this half with his comic timing. The second half belongs to Young who really goes powerhouse with her political speeches and hopes for the country. I think the film should have paid more attention to the political side of things because it made for some nice drama while the love story is very predictable. Cotten and Young have wonderful chemistry together but the supporting cast is just as good. Ethyl Barrymore and Charles Bickford nearly steal the film Rhys Williams Harry Davenport and Tom Powers adding nice support. The film has Frank Capra written all over it and I'm sure he would have made more out of the overall film but for what's here there's plenty to enjoy.".

The first of the MGM series though not the first Tarzan movie nor the only Tarzan film made during the same period Edgar Rice Burroughs had deals with several producers this is the film that broke box office records and spawned ten million Me Tarzan you Jane jokes.The film was made to cash in the previous years Trader Horn a jungle picture that MGM had produced. Wanting to feed a public that wanted more as well as to make use of the hours of location footage shot for that film. The ape man was the perfect choice.The plot has to do with Jane arriving in the jungle to see her father and then going of to find the elephant grave yard. Along the way is carried off by Tarzan and the rest is the movie. Its an exciting ride especially if you forgive the creaky special effects and ape suits.A perfect film for a rainy afternoon".

The first of the MGM series though not the first Tarzan movie nor the only Tarzan film made during the same period Edgar Rice Burroughs had deals with several producers this is the film that broke box office records and spawned ten million Me Tarzan you Jane jokes.The film was made to cash in the previous years Trader Horn a jungle picture that MGM had produced. Wanting to feed a public that wanted more as well as to make use of the hours of location footage shot for that film. The ape man was the perfect choice.The plot has to do with Jane arriving in the jungle to see her father and then going of to find the elephant grave yard. Along the way is carried off by Tarzan and the rest is the movie. Its an exciting ride especially if you forgive the creaky special effects and ape suits.A perfect film for a rainy afternoon";

Dubiously faithful to the Edgar Rice Burroughs story about the humble beginnings to where Tarzan is introduced has been remade numerous timesbut this is the 1932 original where Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan bring a class of style of wit to the roles and the results are absolutely brilliant from beginning to end. Then in 1934MGM made a sequel entitled Tarzan And His Mate which was the second entry in the lavishly produced MGM Tarzan series. Weissmuller and O'Sullivan cohabit in an unmarried bliss before the Hays Code of the era moved them into a treehouse with twin beds. There is also the swimming scenewhich until now has been restored from the original print which has been banned for years until MGM reissued this scene back into the film.

The third entry in MGM's successful WeissmullerO'Sullivan series is still among the better Tarzan movies thanks to the leadsbut the Hays Office made sure that Jane was wearing a lot more clothes this time around since this was also aimed toward adult audiences. The series from this point takes a threeyear hiatus. Then in 1939the fourth entry in MGM's WeissmullerO'Sullivan series went toward the kiddie fare with Tarzan Finds A Son which was family oriented material and a little more tamer than the first two installments. HoweverWeissmuller and O'Sullivan returned to their roles after three years with the addition of five yearold Johnny Sheffield as Boy. He's an orphan whose awful relatives hope he stays lost so they can collect and inheritance. Tarzan and Jane fight to adopt the tyke and when the new family are captured by a wicked tribe only an elephant stampede and Tarzan's call of the jungle can save them.Then in 1941after a two year hiatusthe fifth entry in the series was really standard kiddie fare with Tarzan's Secret Treasure. Tarzan saves an expedition from a savage tribe only to be repaid by having greedy hunters hold Boy and Jane hostage. They want Tarzan's help in finding a secret cache of gold hidden in the jungle. But Tarzan doesn't take kindly to threats against his family and teaches those evildoers a lesson they'll never forget!

The arrival of Parker's daughter Jane O'Sullivan a freespirited ravenhaired beauty complicates matters but her stubborn refusal to lease and confidence with the natives shown as rear projections behind Smith and O'Sullivan finally win the two men over and soon the trio accompanied by whipinduced native labor are on safari.When a dying porter points the way to the Escarpment a massive 'taboo' mountainous plateau protecting the Graveyard the party has the missing piece to the puzzle and begin an arduous climb to the top.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sure I saw bits and pieces of Tarzan the Ape Man on television when I was a kid but I never really paid much attention to it. I just recently checked out the DVD from my local library and I was amazed to discover what I had been missing all these years.This movie made me feel like a young boy craving excitement and adventure. This first installment in the MGM Tarzan movies delivers big time. Yes the special effects and interweaving of the stock footage looks a bit dated but remember that this film was only made three years after the first talkie i.e. a sound picture not a silent movie. There are certain techniques that obviously stem from the silent movie days. But to me this just adds to the charm.The animal footage is excellent. For the first time in a long time I was actually on the edge of my seat during a movie. The CGI effects today are amazing but they're so overdone most of the time. The thrills and suspense in Tarzan are heightened because you know everything you see is physically tangible not an actor reacting to a green screen.I still don't know how they did some of those scenes without anyone getting hurt. Swinging from the treetops wrestling with lions wrestling with leopards being chased by wild animalsall of these things make for great entertainment and adventure.I should also mention that the relationship between Tarzan and Jane is one of the most captivating I've ever seen in a movie. It's very understated yet very sexy. Today they would ruin the story by making the couple have sex after five minutes. But because the sexual chemistry is only hinted at the entire relationship is one of Jane flirting and Tarzan pursuing. It just builds and builds. This romance actually has excitement to it. Definitely one of the best screen romances of all time.Despite a few minor shortcomings in the special effects of the time this is a thrilling movie. Great adventure great excitement great entertainment. Don't miss it!".

Yes the special effects and interweaving of the stock footage looks a bit dated but remember that this film was only made three years after the first talkie i.e. a sound picture not a silent movie. There are certain techniques that obviously stem from the silent movie days. But to me this just adds to the charm.The animal footage is excellent. For the first time in a long time I was actually on the edge of my seat during a movie. The CGI effects today are amazing but they're so overdone most of the time. The thrills and suspense in Tarzan are heightened because you know everything you see is physically tangible not an actor reacting to a green screen.I still don't know how they did some of those scenes without anyone getting hurt. Swinging from the treetops wrestling with lions wrestling with leopards being chased by wild animalsall of these things make for great entertainment and adventure.I should also mention that the relationship between Tarzan and Jane is one of the most captivating I've ever seen in a movie. It's very understated yet very sexy. Today they would ruin the story by making the couple have sex after five minutes. But because the sexual chemistry is only hinted at the entire relationship is one of Jane flirting and Tarzan pursuing. It just builds and builds. This romance actually has excitement to it. Definitely one of the best screen romances of all time.Despite a few minor shortcomings in the special effects of the time this is a thrilling movie. Great adventure great excitement great entertainment. Don't miss it!";

I remember seeing this film back in the day as I recall the business about finding the elephant graveyard. Tarzan the Ape Man reinvigorated the franchise for the first time in the talkie era I was actually surprised to learn that this picture came out in 1932. I mark progress in cinema to a large degree by the stunning achievements of 1933's King Kong so in some respect this was an ambitious film in it's own right.At the time Johnny Weissmuller held sixty seven world records in swimming and five Olympic gold medals. For me he's the definitive movie Tarzan wisely chosen for his athletic physique contrasted to that of bodybuilder types that would arguably hold sway today. Even if not a great actor there's a naturalness to his presence in this film one might expect from someone portraying a savage.Then there's Maureen O'Sullivan. That early scene when she first encountered her father C. Aubrey Smith was a bit strange with a crying jag that went a bit over the top. There are more than a few preCode moments that command the viewer's attention the first being that venture into soft porn territory when she removes her dress and washes her face. Her father rather wisely wished to excuse himself you're just going to have to see it for yourself. By the way the quote in my summary line was uttered by Jane Parker but to her father and not as you would expect to Tarzan.What got me hooked as a Tarzan fan back in my youth was the presence of all the wild animals though watching today I realize that a lot of the apes were actually men in monkey suits. There's also the issue of geographical integrity that Weissmuller's alter ego Jungle Jim encountered in every picture I've seen of that franchise. In this picture Tarzan's first battle with a jungle cat brought him into contact with a jaguar not a leopard as most viewers would suspect. Jaguars are only found in South America so thumbs down there for authenticity. Or maybe I'm just being nitpicky.But hey how about that battle with the pygmy dwarf? natives? That was as surreal as it gets when it comes down to your standard jungle lore. That along with the knife in the eye of the gorilla brute made for some heavy action without requiring a vine swing. I'm not sure if younger viewers today can appreciate all the stuff going on here when everything produced today seems to go for all action all the time. With Tarzan you get back to a primitive minimalism with life and death at stake in hand to claw combat. I can just hear the gasps of 1930's era movie goers when Tarzan hit the big screen.Finally I can't finish this review without mention of Cheeta. Can you believe Cheeta is still alive as I write this? Weissmuller and O'Sullivan are long gone as are all the other principals from the film. I keep checking every so often since I learned of Cheeta's longevity but as of right now though retired he's still in the swing of things.Addendum  NOTE Cheeta passed away on December 24th 2011.".

His costar in these first six films though I think she disappears in the latter six is Maureen O'Sullivan one of the greatest beauties Hollywood ever knew. They are the perfect Tarzan and Jane. Tarzan the Ape Man is extraordinary. The second film of the series Tarzan and His Mate is an acknowledged masterpiece of the adventure drama but I'd almost rank Ape Man aside with it. It is beautifully done in every way fun and exciting but also at lengths gentle charming and downright erotic. There's a long scene where Tarzan and Jane play in the water. It's so sweet and so sexy. There's hardly any background music to the film which sets it apart from many in its era that overused their musical scores. Long scenes are played out silently. There is no attempt to make up for a lack of dialogue. Of course since this is the first time Tarzan meets men at least white men he doesn't speak much except for a few grunts to his chimpanzee buddies. It's quite amazing how much attention and care is put into the way Tarzan behaves how he has become chimplike. I also begin to notice with this film how good an actor Johnny Weismuller is. Tarzan the Ape Man is really a wonderful film. The new box set is absolutely a musthave. 1010.".

	schema:headline " Weissmuller's The Best";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the movie that kicked off the Johnny Weissmuller series of Tarzan pictures which ran for sixteen years through two studios an adopted son and two Janes. Weissmuller is the best Tarzan I've seen. He was a champion Olympic swimmer rather than a trained actor but was blessed with a wonderfully expressive face and had about him a kind of air of primitive moral authority that made him always interesting to watch even when the plots were mediocre or farfetched as increasingly became the case as the series progressed. What's more though Weissmuller's Tarzan may have been a socalled ape man he was himself always touchingly human. Unlike today's action heroes there was a sensitivity to Weissmuller. I know little of the man's personal life but on screen he was always highly responsive to others and their needs was alert to the nuances of human behavior rather than merely a macho man and had at times a refreshing sense of humor that was somehow never cruel or demeaning. He was in short shorn of his jungle instincts a perfect gentleman.As his longtime companion Jane Maureen O'Sullivan was perfect casting. Small and lovely she contrasted perfectly with Weissmuller maintaining her dignity and composure in even in the most dire of circumstances. She knew that Tarzan would always come to the rescue that lions apes and treasure hunters were no match for him and yet she never took him for granted.The first two films of the series were the best thanks in large measure to the Production Code not having gone into effect which caused the series to eventually become domesticated and familycentered. There was a randiness to the early entries that works even today as Tarzan and Jane were after all a couple and the movies don't shy away from this. The Tarzan pictures were not Politically Correct but they're not imperialist either and if anything feel at times like environmental tracts on the issue of leaving the jungles and Tarzan alone.It's probably best to watch the films in sequence if possible. In the MGM period there was a degree of continuity as one movie more or less picked up where the previous one left off. Weissmuller is more credible early on though he's never less than good and Miss O'Sullivan who left the series when it changed studios was always a huge asset. The Tarzan movies offer pure escapism of the most innocent kind. In the first film in the series we see the development of the TarzanJane relationship and there are plenty of thrills and chills along the way. The movie is obviously a backlot production but the use of stock footage lends it an air of authenticity. Also authentic is the rapport between Tarzan and Jane who in their heyday rivaled Fred and Ginger and Nick and Nora Charles as one of the premiere couples of Hollywood's golden age.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ivory hunters James Parker C. Aubrey Smith and Harry Holt Neil Hamilton are in Africa searching for a mythical elephant burial ground when Parker's daughter Jane Maureen O'Sullivan arrives unexpectedly. Despite her father's objections Jane insists on accompanying them on their expedition. During their journey they are shocked when they see a halfnaked white man Johnny Weissmuller living among the apes. The ape man kidnaps Jane and takes her to his home in the treetops where she learns that his name is Tarzan.Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan is one of the mostfilmed characters in movie history. Live action or animation there have been tons of adaptations and they continue to this day. Well for my money none beats the Johnny Weissmuller series at MGM and later RKO. They were exceptional adventure stories sheer fun for young and old alike. Like most film series the earlier movies in the Tarzan series are the better ones starting with this first film. Olympic swimmer Johnny Weissmuller does a fantastic job as Tarzan. He was obviously cast for his looks and athleticism but he brings a sensitivity to the part that's unexpected. He plays him as a laconic manchild innocent and peaceful until the things he cares about are threatened. That famous yell of Tarzan's is unforgettable. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and easy to fall in love with. Her performance is so effortless and real for this period in film. She elevates every scene and makes whoever's acting opposite her give more relaxed performances as well. She has playful and at times sizzling sexual chemistry with Weissmuller. She also has a nice familial chemistry with C. Aubrey Smith. Their scenes have an authenticity about them that is rare to see but is appreciated. The success of the early Tarzan series owes as much to Maureen's Jane as it does to Johnny's Tarzan. Neil Hamilton an actor most will remember as Commissioner Gordon from the '60s Batman TV show does fine playing the part of the guy in love with Jane but can't compete with the rugged but kind Tarzan.Let's not forget this is a PreCode movie. Maureen appears scantily clad and even wearing a soaking wet thin dress in one scene. And of course Weissmuller wears nothing but a loincloth throughout. Being that it was filmed in 1932 there is some inevitable creakiness an overuse of stock footage and some spotty rear projection effects. But these things are minor negatives. The action scenes are great. Tarzan wrestling with an obviously stuffed leopard may seem hokey to many modern viewers but it holds a certain quaint appeal for me. The animals are fun. Who doesn't love Cheeta? The matte painting backdrops are also nice. It's exciting romantic escapism with a good cast and solid direction from Woody 'One Take' Van Dyke. Followed by many sequels the first of which is even better than this classic.".

Despite her father's objections Jane insists on accompanying them on their expedition. During their journey they are shocked when they see a halfnaked white man Johnny Weissmuller living among the apes. The ape man kidnaps Jane and takes her to his home in the treetops where she learns that his name is Tarzan.Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan is one of the mostfilmed characters in movie history. Live action or animation there have been tons of adaptations and they continue to this day. Well for my money none beats the Johnny Weissmuller series at MGM and later RKO. They were exceptional adventure stories sheer fun for young and old alike. Like most film series the earlier movies in the Tarzan series are the better ones starting with this first film. Olympic swimmer Johnny Weissmuller does a fantastic job as Tarzan. He was obviously cast for his looks and athleticism but he brings a sensitivity to the part that's unexpected. He plays him as a laconic manchild innocent and peaceful until the things he cares about are threatened. That famous yell of Tarzan's is unforgettable. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and easy to fall in love with. Her performance is so effortless and real for this period in film. She elevates every scene and makes whoever's acting opposite her give more relaxed performances as well. She has playful and at times sizzling sexual chemistry with Weissmuller. She also has a nice familial chemistry with C. Aubrey Smith. Their scenes have an authenticity about them that is rare to see but is appreciated. The success of the early Tarzan series owes as much to Maureen's Jane as it does to Johnny's Tarzan. Neil Hamilton an actor most will remember as Commissioner Gordon from the '60s Batman TV show does fine playing the part of the guy in love with Jane but can't compete with the rugged but kind Tarzan.Let's not forget this is a PreCode movie. Maureen appears scantily clad and even wearing a soaking wet thin dress in one scene. And of course Weissmuller wears nothing but a loincloth throughout. Being that it was filmed in 1932 there is some inevitable creakiness an overuse of stock footage and some spotty rear projection effects. But these things are minor negatives. The action scenes are great. Tarzan wrestling with an obviously stuffed leopard may seem hokey to many modern viewers but it holds a certain quaint appeal for me. The animals are fun. Who doesn't love Cheeta? The matte painting backdrops are also nice. It's exciting romantic escapism with a good cast and solid direction from Woody 'One Take' Van Dyke. Followed by many sequels the first of which is even better than this classic.";

	schema:reviewBody "TARZAN THE APE MAN MGM 1932 directed by W.S. Van Dyke the first of three movies bearing this title arguably the best of the trio introduces Olympic swimming champion Johnny Weissmuller to the role that made him legendary and this is where it all began. While not the first Tarzan movie ever made the Tarzan of the movies was first introduced during the silent era as TARZAN OF THE APES 1918 starring Elmo Lincoln as Edgar Rice Burrough's jungle hero. Few stories have captured the world's imagination as Burrough's fictional character and who would have imagined the legend to remain popular long after its debut. With a few more Tarzan's carried over through the 1920s as played by various actors it is Weissmuller's carnation whom many remember best actually Tarzan more according to MGM than Burroughs. The movie leaves many questions unanswered giving no indication to Tarzan's origin  who is he and how did he get to be in the wilds of Africa? In spite of numerous changes from the book TARZAN THE APE MAN became successful enough to spawn numerous sequels and imitators thus keeping Weissmuller as the Hollywood swinger for twelve more movies in the next 16 years. The long reign of Tarzan began here starting with the overly familiar jungle theme underscored during the opening titles that was presented as recently as 1931's adventure of TRADER HORN MGM 1931 starring Harry Carey and Edwina Booth with excess footage filmed in Africa.The story begins where Jane Maureen O'Sullivan a young English girl arriving in Africa where she comes to the trading post to accompany her father Colonel James Parker C. Aubrey Smith and his young assistant Harry Holt Neil Hamilton on an expedition in search for ivory that can be found in an elephant burial ground. After encountering near death experiences such as encountering dangerous animals climbing large mountains and walking through narrow paths and the fall through the deep canyon of several African native aids the safari nearly reaches its destination until they hear the sounds of a jungle yell followed by the disappearance of Jane. Jane who had been whisked away by a white jungle man Johnny Weissmuller has taken his captive to his tree top home surrounded by apes. At first Jane is fearful of the man who calls himself Tarzan but in time she calms down long enough in an attempt to teach him to speak her language. After Jane rejoins her father and Harry Tarzan follows. Harry who is in love with Jane is jealous of her interest in this jungle man and makes several attempts to get Tarzna out of the way by shooting at him in spite of Jane's pleas. Holt's attempt only injures Tarzan putting him out of commission for a while. Later after Parker's safari is captured and held prisoner by a savage dwarf tribe they find they are in great danger as they are placed into a deep pit one by one where they are to be sacrificed by Zumangani a giant gorilla.This MGM production which consists of rear projection photography featuring African natives stock animal footage and villages sets the pattern for future installments to come. Aside from Tarzan's realistic approach in killing animals either for food or in self defense certain scenes come off on a graphic level such as the climatic scene where Tarzan comes to rescue the safari by battling with the giant gorilla and saving himself from being torn to peaces by throwing his knife in the direction that leaves the result to become quite hideous. Other than that TARZAN THE APE MAN doesn't disappoint when it comes to action and adventure with Weissmuller being the ideal choice as Tarzan who doesn't make his first screen presence until a half hour from the start of the story. In spite of its popularity TARZAN THE APE MAN had limited television revivals until the early 1980s when it became the first Tarzan movie of the Weissmuller series to be distributed on video cassette. It's interesting to point out that TARZAN THE APE MAN which plays regularly on Turner Classic Movies was the only movie in the entire long running series not to become part of the Tarzan package during the four year run 19972001 on American Movie Classics. In some certain parts of the United States TARZAN THE APE MAN didn't play on the same TV channel along with the others and yet this is actually part of the series but treated as an individual movie. Later displayed on DVD along with the five MGM sequels TARZAN THE APE MAN has assured cultural status especially with good stories plenty of action with Weissmuller and O'Sullivan enacting their parts to perfection. Next installment TARZAN AND HIS MATE 1934. ".

With Tarzan I thought this movie was the worst of the bunch or at least the first six which comprise my Tarzan Collection DVD package. I will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but I am through sitting through this turkey thanks to several characters.Well let's start with the good news firstTHE GOOD  Plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display even if they are just stock footage. You see lion attacks crocodiles hippos panthers you name it and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds including pygmies called dwarfs in the movie. Since this movie was made almost 75 years ago I can't knock any of the realism because they didn't have it in the movies that long ago. They do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds. However Weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape. He and O'Sullivan make a wellbuilt handsome couple if there ever was one in those Golden Years of cinema.The film has historical value with so many sequels in that it shows how Tarzan acquired Jane and his beginnings of learning the English language.The BAD  From the moment Jane Parker is taken by Tarzan almost every scene with her is Maureen O'Sullivan in hysterics shrieking and screaming scene after scene. It's enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film. Thankfully she calmed down in the sequels but not in this movie. The movie also does no favors for The Great White Hunter image as C. Aubrey Smith playing Jane's father and Neil Hamilton as Harry Holt the safari guide shoot at every animal within sight whether the beasts is threatening or not. These people are kill happy particularly Smith. On another note it's too bad there isn't anything in here explaining how Tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place. There is no history of him in here or footage of his growing up. He's just there when Jane and the group get to a certain point in Africa.".

	schema:reviewBody "This would be a very interesting movie to study as a case of synthesis in filmmaking. A number of sets were made on the back lots and on location in Californiasome of the trees are recognizably California trees perhaps the Eucalyptus imported long ago. And then they use stock footage shot in Africa and perhaps a bit shot in zoos as well. In the early part of the movie the actors perform in front of backprojected film of Africans in traditional costume gathering and drumming and dancing. The actors walk around the corner of the bamboo houses and stand in front of the people supposedly gathered for trading. In other scenes there is often intelligent intercutting between animal footage and live actionreal alligators hurry toward the water and swim amongst real hippos and then cut to a safe pond where mechanical crocodile backs churn across the surface in perfect coordination like water ballet as Johnny Weismuller swims his championship crawl. The mixture of actual apes chimpanzees and people in ape costume is perhaps the least convincing blend.The story is rather dim and missing key elements of continuity but it doesn't seem to matter so much since the main point of the film is to bring Tarzan and Jane Maureen O'Sullivan together. There's a crusty father C. Aubrey Smith determined to find the elephants' graveyard and a stalwart colonial hero Henry Holt Neil Hamilton who begins well but goes downhill as the trek through the jungle shows him to be a brute and there are perhaps a dozen expendable black porters killed along the way by falls from cliffs arrows of hostile tribes crocodiles and some sort of captive gorillagod. There aren't any left at the end of the trip though all the white people survive. This isn't good.Weirdest of all is the appearance of the hostile tribethey're not pygmies they're dwarfs as the father explains in matteroffact tones. Sure enough it's the entire stock of Hollywood small people in black makeup. Tarzan and the friendly elephants take care of them.What is decidedly not pleasant here is the explicit racism the profiteering and imperialist motives and the callousness toward African human and animal life. Even Tarzan is guilty for he dispatches several of the porters himself after Holt has shot one of his apefriends. Jane tries to prevent Holt from shooting Tarzan by crying out He's White! Not so much according to the father who deems Tarzan little more than an animal and Holt sneers and glowers. And well he might because he'd imagined Jane was his property.There's the other fascinating thing about this movie the attraction between the nearlymute beautiful apeman and the nearlyalwaysspeaking beautiful civilized girl. It can't be anything but animal magnetism or rather pure sex. Weismuller spends the whole film nearly naked and looking pretty good and O'Sullivan indicates her potential sexiness when she changes clothes early in the film pausing in her silky undergarments to laugh at her father's discomfiture. By the time her clothes get torn and she goes swimming with Tarzan her curves and general loveliness become an integral part of the story. Tarzan and Jane are fascinated by each other and can't stop staring. Tarzan is curious and innocent and hypnotized and Jane passes through the obligatory stage of being frightened into an appreciation of Tarzan's character beauty and sense of identity in and with the jungle and at last into a happy ease in her own sensuality. This last development allows her to stay in Africa as Holt retreats on the back of a borrowed elephant.This is a ridiculous and offensive movie and it is also rather wonderful. The best moment other than O'Sullivan and Weismuller at play in the water and all wet on shore is when Jane is bandaging the wounded Tarzan's head and the young chimpanzee puts his arm around her shoulders.".

Aubrey Smith determined to find the elephants' graveyard and a stalwart colonial hero Henry Holt Neil Hamilton who begins well but goes downhill as the trek through the jungle shows him to be a brute and there are perhaps a dozen expendable black porters killed along the way by falls from cliffs arrows of hostile tribes crocodiles and some sort of captive gorillagod. There aren't any left at the end of the trip though all the white people survive. This isn't good.Weirdest of all is the appearance of the hostile tribethey're not pygmies they're dwarfs as the father explains in matteroffact tones. Sure enough it's the entire stock of Hollywood small people in black makeup. Tarzan and the friendly elephants take care of them.What is decidedly not pleasant here is the explicit racism the profiteering and imperialist motives and the callousness toward African human and animal life. Even Tarzan is guilty for he dispatches several of the porters himself after Holt has shot one of his apefriends. Jane tries to prevent Holt from shooting Tarzan by crying out He's White! Not so much according to the father who deems Tarzan little more than an animal and Holt sneers and glowers. And well he might because he'd imagined Jane was his property.There's the other fascinating thing about this movie the attraction between the nearlymute beautiful apeman and the nearlyalwaysspeaking beautiful civilized girl. It can't be anything but animal magnetism or rather pure sex. Weismuller spends the whole film nearly naked and looking pretty good and O'Sullivan indicates her potential sexiness when she changes clothes early in the film pausing in her silky undergarments to laugh at her father's discomfiture. By the time her clothes get torn and she goes swimming with Tarzan her curves and general loveliness become an integral part of the story. Tarzan and Jane are fascinated by each other and can't stop staring. Tarzan is curious and innocent and hypnotized and Jane passes through the obligatory stage of being frightened into an appreciation of Tarzan's character beauty and sense of identity in and with the jungle and at last into a happy ease in her own sensuality. This last development allows her to stay in Africa as Holt retreats on the back of a borrowed elephant.This is a ridiculous and offensive movie and it is also rather wonderful. The best moment other than O'Sullivan and Weismuller at play in the water and all wet on shore is when Jane is bandaging the wounded Tarzan's head and the young chimpanzee puts his arm around her shoulders.";

The main idea was to use some expensive film that had been shot on location in Africa for Trader Horn but never seen on the screen. It's believable. There's not much evidence of effort having been put into the story or characters. A lot of animals chase each other through the jungle.Maureen O'Sullivan is Miss Jane Parker the daughter of C. Aubrey Smith. They an extraneous white guy and their native bearers are on safari in a part o the Dark Continent where the hand of man has never set foot. They're searching for an elephant graveyard. You know the place where moribund elephants wander to die among their ancestors' bones? That's how Jane puts it anyway. Why there must be a fortune in ivory in all those tusks! Of course it's the devil of a time getting the tusks out of the skulls. In Alabama the Tuscaloosa. I don't care. I refuse to put any more effort into a joke like that than the writers Cyril Hume and Ivor Novello have put into the script.And man have they butchered Edgar Rice Burroughs' original story and characters. I was addicted to them when I was barely a teen. They were implausible then. Now the story and characters are dumbed down so that a fiveyearold can absorb them. Eg. the original Tarzan was a Viscount by birth. You won't find that mentioned here. Somebody might ask What's a Viscount? And if I remember Tarzan spoke not only ape language which apes don't have but was self taught in English as well. And his English was as good as any Brit's. His lexicon encompassed words like scarcely and width. However having Tarzan speak English means writing more dialog which takes time effort skill and money. Better  and easier  to have Johnny Weismuller thump his chest say Tarzan then thump Maureen O'Sullivan's chest at the sternoclavicular notch and say Jane! There now. Isn't that easier than having him ask something like I say actually what is your sincere impression of this verdant paradise? There are so many scenes of combat involving so many different kinds of animals from hippos lions leopards gorillas and crocodiles to dwarf humans that I lost interest after a while. My interest was piqued momentarily as Jane's dress was gradually ripped to shreds by the jungle shrubs and when she deliberately tore some swaths off to make a bandage for Tarzan's head.That brings up another subject. I don't know what Tarzan thought of Jane per se but she evidently grows affectionate towards him after spending some time in his tree house. She comes up with something like Oh Tarzan you don't even know what a kiss IS do you? Well he may not know how to kiss but he sweeps her up tenderly in his arms and carries her slowly off to his rude budoir. And what does Jane do you ask? Protest? Hardly. She submissively buries her face in his shoulder and allows herself to be taken away. To do what  make fudge?The next time we see her it's day time and she's lying on a leopard skin rug in the tree house wreathed in smiles of satisfaction. And at the fade out Tarzan and Jane wave goodbye to the departing remnants of the safari content to seek happiness alone in the jungle. Well not alone  all those elephants. But without benefit of clergy I might add. I ask you what kind of movie IS this? Would you let your children watch this salacious filth? What do you suppose they'll learn from it  that it's fun to swing from the chandelier? How to play doctor in the tree house? No no. Take us back to the original where Tarzan and Jane remain pure and Tarzan is articulate enough to say Now Tarzan will wage war on the miscreant Gomangani.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the 1930s1950s there were a long succession of jungle pictures in theaters. And for the most part they sucked. These films featured gradez actors and directors significant use of bad stock footage often of Asian or South American locations even though the films were supposedly set in Africa and dumb writing. Because of this after a while I stopped watching themthey are very dull indeed. However MGM's Tarzan the Ape Man is an exception I am going to makeafter all instead of the usual poverty row studio this one was made by the most prestigious studio on the planet. Instead of lousy actors MGM pulled out their Agame with Maureen O'Sullivan Neil Hamilton at the time a big starthough mostly forgotten today except for his role as 'Commissioner Gordon' on TVs Batman and C. Aubrey Smith. And not surprisingly they cast a new actor as Tarzanas it would be hard to accept an actor with an established reputation as a jungle savage! So they obtained the services of Olypmic champion swimmer Johnny Weismuller to play the lead. I couldn't wait to see a good jungle film! Would this fit the bill? The film skips the story of the Greystokes being lost in Africa with their young baby who would grow up to be Tarzan. Instead it begins many years later when an African expedition happens to find the young manquite by accident. But before Tarzan meets the entire expedition he meets Jane and they hit it off in some cute scenes.On the negative side for this film there is STILL the significant use of stock footagesome of which clearly doesn't fit the film such as the scenes where they show various tribesmen who are filmed in very different locations than where the action is set. And unfortunately there are some guys dressed up as chimpssomething that just looked cheap though these were a bit better than the usual chimp suits. There also is a fake crocodile that looked pretty silly conversely the fake hippos in this same scene were pretty good. And because of all this I just can't understand reviews that gave the film 10s. On the positive despite the cheesy stock footage the acting was lovely and the script very good. These were able to make up for a lot of the film's deficiencies. The mountain hiking scene is very impressive for 1932and a very nice use of trick photography and matte paintings. Also a few real animals were used on the setssuch as a hippo and baby chimps and fights with real live lionsnot dead stuffed ones which I HAVE seen in other Tarzan films. It clearly skimped a bit here and there but also did have impressive touches a better budget would allow. As a result the film is significantly more watchable than the usual jungle filmincluding many of the later nonJohnny Weismuller films. It's worth seeing as it's among the very best of the Tarzan filmsif not the best.By the way the followup film Tarzan and His Mate is a notorious movie. That's because it features a very very risqu nude swimming sequenceone that ran afoul of the new toughened Production Code in an effort to make movies more familyfriendly. This very nude scene was anything but familyfriendly! And by the time it was ready for release the code was being strengthenedand these changes forced the scene to be severely edited. Recently the edited footage has been restoredand it is rather hoteven by today's standardsand certainly not what you'd expect in what is seen as a kids' film. Both this risqu and the previous film excel however as they are quite romanticsomething that CAN'T be said of other jungle epics!Also in Tarzan the Ape Man they use Asian elephants. While I am usually a stickler for realism especially since the animals often shown in jungle films are just the wrong species for Africa I don't object to this in this particular case as African elephants are a lot more dangerous and I wouldn't want the studio to use these beasts though some circuses haveat much greater risk.".

But before Tarzan meets the entire expedition he meets Jane and they hit it off in some cute scenes.On the negative side for this film there is STILL the significant use of stock footagesome of which clearly doesn't fit the film such as the scenes where they show various tribesmen who are filmed in very different locations than where the action is set. And unfortunately there are some guys dressed up as chimpssomething that just looked cheap though these were a bit better than the usual chimp suits. There also is a fake crocodile that looked pretty silly conversely the fake hippos in this same scene were pretty good. And because of all this I just can't understand reviews that gave the film 10s. On the positive despite the cheesy stock footage the acting was lovely and the script very good. These were able to make up for a lot of the film's deficiencies. The mountain hiking scene is very impressive for 1932and a very nice use of trick photography and matte paintings. Also a few real animals were used on the setssuch as a hippo and baby chimps and fights with real live lionsnot dead stuffed ones which I HAVE seen in other Tarzan films. It clearly skimped a bit here and there but also did have impressive touches a better budget would allow. As a result the film is significantly more watchable than the usual jungle filmincluding many of the later nonJohnny Weismuller films. It's worth seeing as it's among the very best of the Tarzan filmsif not the best.By the way the followup film Tarzan and His Mate is a notorious movie. That's because it features a very very risqu nude swimming sequenceone that ran afoul of the new toughened Production Code in an effort to make movies more familyfriendly. This very nude scene was anything but familyfriendly! And by the time it was ready for release the code was being strengthenedand these changes forced the scene to be severely edited. Recently the edited footage has been restoredand it is rather hoteven by today's standardsand certainly not what you'd expect in what is seen as a kids' film. Both this risqu and the previous film excel however as they are quite romanticsomething that CAN'T be said of other jungle epics!Also in Tarzan the Ape Man they use Asian elephants. While I am usually a stickler for realism especially since the animals often shown in jungle films are just the wrong species for Africa I don't object to this in this particular case as African elephants are a lot more dangerous and I wouldn't want the studio to use these beasts though some circuses haveat much greater risk.";

The fight scenes between Tarzan and animals which look damn realistic are bloody and violent and it's HEAVILY implied that Tarzan and Jane have sex.  Also Weissmuller wears next to nothingnot that that's a BAD thingthe guy is handsome young tall and has a GREAT figure.  And Jane isn't wearing much either.  The sequel got even worse with more explicit violence and Jane having a lengthy underwater swimming scene totally nude.  After that the Production Code clamped down on them.  So this movie does have a very adult tone and was not aimed at children.  Also Weissmuller is very good as Tarzanhe acts just like you would expect him to act.  He's like a little boy just finding out thingsjust as the part should be played.  He was just a little too grimI was shocked when he actually smiled!This is not the classic I was led to believe it isTarzan and His Mate is 20 times better.

Combine those three aspects in a narrative that explores the grieving process of a welltodo business man and you have the basic plot for this film.Each of us grieves in our own way but generally in a manner that's wellknown and understood. The man of this story Pietro Palladini Nanni Moretti is different however when his wife dies unexpectedly in the first ten minutes his attitude is one of apparent indifference. Moreover his behavior takes another turn when he insists on remaining outside his daughter's school every day all day instead of returning to his highly paid highpowered position as a senior executive with a company that's infighting a merger with an American outfit. When called by his office he insists he can do his work in his car or while sitting on a park bench opposite the school...That sort of aberrant attitude raises questions and helped this viewer to stay with the story to peel back the layers and find out what's eating Pietro.As the widower Nanni Moretti gives a quietly brooding and pensive performance that has an almost di Nero quality. It's contrasted nicely with Carlo Alessandro Gassman Pietro's celebrity brother who is as extroverted as Pietro is the opposite  the veritable chalk and cheese. Between the two is Pietro's daughter Blu Yoshimi who also displays a marked lack of affect after the death of her mother. On the periphery to those three are the women who intrude upon Pietro's solitary quotidian watch over his daughter's school Marta Valeria Gollino his nervously unstable sisterinlaw Eleonora Isabella Ferrari the woman whom he rescued from drowning in the film's opening sequence and the stunningly ravishing Jolanda Kasia Smutniak the young woman who insists upon walking her dog  and herself  closer to where Pietro sits with each passing day. As Pietro sits and watches her his gaze tells us he's wandering into fantasy without a doubt...And from time to time some of Pietro's colleagues from the office turn up to discuss office politics and the impending merger  capped I might add with a cameo from Roman Polanski as Steiner the business mogul who wants to use Pietro to help with the merger.Except for one torrid animalistic sex scene  simply a cry for connection between two lonely people  this is a gentle story that's beautifully photographed around Rome and Lazio Italy. The acting especially from Moretti and Yoshimi is without fault I think and Valeria Gollino always gives pleasurable viewing. The soundtrack is adequate the pacing is in sync with a story that is very much about selfanalysis and introspection i.e. some might think too slow  but the editing and direction keep the narrative moving well.So enjoy the views the music the shaded park and the transient visitors as Pietro comes to terms with his loss.

I mean it as a compliment when I say it is the sort of movie Jane Austen might have scripted had she survived to the ripe old age of 233. The film happens to be set in presentday Italy so there is a bit of local color for Italophiles but it could have been set in any modern Western nation. Pietro a successful businessman confronts the sudden death of his wife as he seeks to ease the transition for his now motherless tenyearold daughter. Apparently to show her he is fully there for her he abandons his office and waits for his daughter in the piazza outside her school each school day. Tutto il mondo comes to that piazza  gossiping mothers a developmentally challenged boy Pietro's hot sisterinlaw on the verge of a nervous breakdown his secretary with papers to sign his colleagues from the office stewing over the progress of merger negotiations and what it means to them a young beauty with a big dog who needs a hug the beauty I mean even Roman Polanski in a cameo appearance. Over the course of the picture Pietro convincingly works through his feelings about marriage loss grief friendship family and desire. The emotional center of Caos Calmo is like a toned down more serious sitcom like Seinfeld on downers. As in life there are small mysteries unsolved but no scene  surely not the muchdiscussed nighttime scene that serves to affirm life  is out of place. The film works. Enjoy it.".

If you like Moretti's movies you're gonna love it but you'll be much more interested if you are wishing to see a fresh and sweet'n'sour story. Despite a mournful start The death of a motherwife Grimaldi tries not to show us tears or desperation. We see a huge number of hugs instead and a large amount of children The bench is in front of a school. We see sunny days and professionals on their break enforcing the human aspect of every character. The film is never raw as it's never too soft.

It's been said that's a movie about the absence of grief but even to that effect the sense of grief should be somehow somewhere implied which it is not in the least. The ending is there just because the movie had to be ended but it could have happened like that at any point. There is no change or development. Seemingly adult people talk as if they were permanently immature teenagers and a little girl comes out with a typically adult comment on her pairs. Comments upon life society corporations etc. are a sequel of common places typical of talk shows. Would be dramatic sequences seem picked out from fashionable advertising clips and have the same emotional impact. The overrated and overdiscussed torrid sex scene is just a softer imitation of hard core platitudes. No doubt there was matter for drama but apparently the author didn't know how to deal with it may very well be that under this viewpoint the script has been quite truthful to the Veronesi's novel it's been based on.".

Out of nowhere a woman whose life he saved the same day of his wife's death pops out of nowhere and has wild sex with him.Then Claudia asks him to go back to work as she is probably embarrassed by his freakish behavior and off he goes.Considering the plot this is a strangely emotionless movie. Watching it one can easily forget that the Pietro is a widower and Claudia an orphan who just lost her mother. This odd couple is  allegedly  dealing with grief through denial or perhaps just plain indifference.Besides this movie suffers from a typical Italian problem the lack of an ending that justify the storytelling in the first place. Like many other Italian movies the plot starts believably and ends in a big nowhere. Boring.".

	schema:headline " Haneke has an amazing clarity about people's alienation";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is the last in Michael Haneke's trilogy about alienation called Vergletscherung die Gefhle and it ends in a violent climax which is a result of the previous fragments that Haneke presents to us. In this film Haneke developed a style that is very reminiscient of his 2000 film Code Inconnu. It features rather short episodes and within each episode there is scarcely editing or camera movement. Each episode is divided by a second's black screen and Haneke often interrupts and ends the episode in the middle of a person's sentence. This is a very economical style of filmmaking and it certainly demands a lot of the viewers because you only get the information you really need to connect this episode thematically to the others. Because this is a thematic film and it is a brilliant stylish icecold halfmisanthropic study of people's lack of ability to perform tender acts with each other. I have never seen people make love in a film by Haneke except for the masochistic and sad attempts in La Pianiste. Rather Haneke shows his characters in situations where they are tired fed up irritated or full of hate quite ordinary human emotions. You cannot blame Haneke for not being a positive director for he is the only filmmaker working today who can portray and observe his characters so coldly and so unpassionately. And his project seems to be to expose our lack of love and passion for each other but most of all our lack of ability to tell it as it is. Speak to each other and solve everything seems to be Haneke's advice without him really giving it. I never seem to like Haneke's characters and that is a good thing really. Like fellow Germanspeaking directors Herzog and Fassbinder Haneke seems a bit misanthropic in his characteristics. Too many directors try too hard to give characters sympathetic traits and you just lose interest in the story. 71 Fragmente einer Chronologie des Zufalls is quite an achievement in filmmaking and it is a film that will stick with me forever. I will never forget because I never knew why the incident at the end. That is how I will remember this film and how many times in real life is why the only question never answered?".

If you're looking for something that you can watch with half a brain then avoid this movie like the plague. 71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance is an experimental film from visionary mastermind Michael Haneke. The film is 71 different scenes that highlight small tidbits of the lives a seemingly random collection of people. News clips of war and Michael Jackson are spliced into the film as well creating a disjointed and difficult narrative that in some ways all ties together but in other ways stays loose and frivolous. The interpretation of this kind of narrative style is at the viewers discretion.If you're at all familiar with Haneke's work then you'll know not to expect anything straightforward going into this film. If you go into this film knowing nothing about Haneke then may God have mercy on your soul. Not really just be prepared. This is not an easy film to follow being that there seems to not be much to follow. The majority of the film spends its time laying down the various puzzle pieces with very little rhyme or reason to the distribution of the pieces. Towards the end of the film the pieces begin coming together for a fairly anticlimactic ending that reflects the perpetual sadness of a world full of violence hardship neglect and hatred. You'll never miss Haneke's macabre cynicism in any of this films and especially not this one.It's difficult for me to form a steadfast opinion on this film because it is so out there and so difficult to fully comprehend. As always I respect Michael Haneke for the being the true genius he is. He's created something wholly original and intuitive here I just can't quite place what it is. There are a lot of lines going in different directions here and they never seem quite seem to meet up. This film challenges the ideas of your typical film narrative and I have to give it kudos for taking such risks and ending up with something that works more or less. 71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance isn't a film you just watch it's something you experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film last night and I found it very inspirational. I adore Haneke and the subject matter he chooses. For me this was completely gripping from the beginning. I loved the clarity of the scenes and the honest depiction of the various characters was chilling in parts. There is so much packed in this film I came away full of ideas. Two scenes stick in my head. The first is a scene at a kitchen table where a man tells a woman he loves her. I found it very realistic and its portrayal of this married couple was for me brutal but unflinching in its directness about the lives that we lead and the cages we build for ourselves. The second scene is an amazing shot of a character playing table tennis against an automatic opponent. It's a great shot. It's a shot that says so much. As it continues we as a viewer concentrate more on the character's face and what is written on it. Pain anguish fear and despair. A man so locked onto a path that he realises perhaps in this scene he is no longer able to return to normality. I waited for him to become exhausted but he never does and Haneke cuts the scene with him still playing hoping perhaps the machine will break but not able to control what now controls him. As far as I know he may have gone on for hours more. A superb insight into a character's psyche encapsulated in one shot. A shocking ending rounds off a well constructed film that tries to explain why some of these events happen and does so in a thoughtprovoking way. There is never a dull moment in this film and I would recommend it to anyone as essential viewing. The film speaks for itself.".

What follows is a ninety minute procession of apparently unrelated stories unfolding before us detailing the lives of everyday people. From a lonely old man to a couple fostering an aloof child a border hopping street urchin to an austere and religious security guard and his wife the film covers many lives and relationships. The transitions between these are marked by a black screen with occasional footage of news stories interjected throughout. These show us the chaos and anarchy of the characters' world bitesize glimpses into everyday horrors. Perhaps the only discernible thing connecting them is the mire of insanity which occupies their television screens something best remembered for later. Each miniature story is compelling and interesting a fine achievement given the limited screen time each gets with such an array of characters to be explored. Some of course engender more interest than others the old man and student characters two which I found myself particularly drawn to. Haneke unsurprisingly constructs long and unconventional shots beautiful in their individuality. An early morning ritual scene recalls Der Siebente Kontinent the camera's focus on actions rather than faces an important technique in establishing the life of this particular family. A long and winding scene featuring the elderly man on the phone to his daughter is though entirely banal and mundane one of the film's strongest moments its ability to so simply yet comprehensively detail a character quite wonderful. Though one might argue that the film appears to go in no clear direction for most of its running time this is a clear part of its slowly unfolding eventual plan. It is only in the last ten minutes of the film that we see anything more than a flyonthewall documentary of regular lives and are introduced to the film's true message one that is impactful subtle and the perfect finale for a trilogy that delightfully explores its chosen theme.Creating portraits of a wide number of characters each more intimate than many films' main characters 71 Fragmente einer Chronologie des Zufalls is a very fine final act in a very fine trilogy. Just as subtle removed and nonjudgmental as its predecessors this is a comprehensive and thoughtprovoking social commentary which will doubtlessly benefit from multiple viewings perhaps even more so than its cinematic siblings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before Austrian film director Michael Haneke got wellrecognized and appreciated in the international film circuit with such films as Code Unknown Time of the Wolf and The Piano Teacher all of which were made in France and shown in Cannes he already made his mark with a number of films made in his native Austria one of which is this film called 71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance1994. This work is the third installment in the director's glaciation trilogy the other two being The Seventh Continent and Benny's Video thus called because of the central theme of the fine line between barbarism and civility in modern urban life being completely hopelessly blurred. The barrier has been broken so to speak.As the title suggests the film consists of 71 fragments or vignettes seemingly random unrelated and mundane of various characters going through the motions and vagaries of daily existence in urban Austria. But one can sense that this only seems to be so as the film's prologue suggests that this is the event that will loom over the succeeding fragments. And that is the 1993 Christmas Eve reckless shooting done by a 19yearold student named only as Maximillian B. inside a bank and on the streets before eventually shooting himselfone that is purportedly based on a reallife incident.No explanations or backstories are provided to the characters and their situations being shown episodically on the screen a Romanian boy refugee a bank delivery man an old pensioner a childless couple and of course the student himself. More often than not a specific fragment is abruptly interrupted or ended by a black fadeout an alienating technique Haneke once again utilized in the equally visceral and demanding Code Unknown. Some fragments happen for not more than a minute while some last for as long as five or even eight minutes notably the scene where the student practices pingpong tennis facing an automated opponent and the scene where the old pensioner argues with his daughter over the phone both of which vividly displaying a whole gamut of simmering emotions without ever resorting to histrionics. Even reinforcing the clinical cold approachfor which Haneke is really knownis the utter lack of an accompanying soundtrack and the wordlessness of some scenes.The sense of dread is punctuated by the everpresent television as is the case in the two other films in the trilogy from where a specific world news is being broadcast like the ethnic war in Somalia and the child abuse charges against pop star Michael Jackson. This is as if to suggest that the looming event foreboded at the film's start is itself to become a subject of a TV news coverage which albeit small in scale when compared to the news indicated above is nevertheless not without a lasting cost to the human lives involved physically emotionally and psychologically. Having said this how has the line separating civility and barbarism come to be completely violated in this thoughtprovoking film?The trigger shooting perpetrated by the young student which serves to be the film's denouement appears to have been done for no apparent reason at all. It's senseless killing in its purest meaning which arguably is the underlying essence of the middleclass family's suicide in The Seventh Continent and the teenage boy's videotaped murder of the girl in Benny's Video. And this is what makes the act all the more chilling. It's as if to suggest that such a selfdestructive act is inherent in everyone of us if not what makes up our essence waiting only to be brought to the surface by a seemingly random and inconsequential spate of events in 71 Fragments' case it's to be rooted in the student's lack of enough cash to pay for his car gas.And when the event does finally happen rather than to serve as an important foodforthought it's sadly reduced to no more than a piece of media sensation regarded as the hot news of the day focusing more on what happened than on why did it happen. The alarming incident thus becomes another piece of media entertainment to be savored by mass consumers who always crave for what is sensational and controversial without ever thinking of its deeprooted incitations and implications. This is a thought which Haneke is to delve fullblown in Funny Games both the Austrian and American versions though I really prefer the first one.If in Polish auteur Krzysztof Kieslowski's world chance incidents and fateful encounters are all part of a grand design to convey deep layers of human emotional truths like in the truly majestic Three Colors trilogy in Haneke's or at least in the world of 71 Fragments such randomness is to be put in order by an inherent barbarism that's only barely creeping out of the human psyche.".

It's as if to suggest that such a selfdestructive act is inherent in everyone of us if not what makes up our essence waiting only to be brought to the surface by a seemingly random and inconsequential spate of events in 71 Fragments' case it's to be rooted in the student's lack of enough cash to pay for his car gas.And when the event does finally happen rather than to serve as an important foodforthought it's sadly reduced to no more than a piece of media sensation regarded as the hot news of the day focusing more on what happened than on why did it happen. The alarming incident thus becomes another piece of media entertainment to be savored by mass consumers who always crave for what is sensational and controversial without ever thinking of its deeprooted incitations and implications. This is a thought which Haneke is to delve fullblown in Funny Games both the Austrian and American versions though I really prefer the first one.If in Polish auteur Krzysztof Kieslowski's world chance incidents and fateful encounters are all part of a grand design to convey deep layers of human emotional truths like in the truly majestic Three Colors trilogy in Haneke's or at least in the world of 71 Fragments such randomness is to be put in order by an inherent barbarism that's only barely creeping out of the human psyche.";

	schema:reviewBody "It is a tough choice between Das Schlo and 71 Fragmente einer Chronologie des Zufalls although I have not seen most of his nonGerman works. This movie here is over 20 years old and the last and weakest chapter from a trilogy of films that Haneke made about violence young delinquents and young victims the first. His film here also has lots of social commentary mostly about the War in Kosovo which was a big subject at that time. The acting is strong as usual especially from the old guy in Haneke's films but somehow his bleak and atmospheric approach the one he always has did not really do too much for me here. I wasn't particularly interested in the characters and I did not really care enough for them to be really sad at the end I guess. But it is also Haneke's usual strategy to go out with an unhappy end and that is not a problem at all. it actually gives several of his works a more realistic and authentic touch.This movie here is the only one from the trilogy that was not submitted by Austria to the Oscars so it is fitting I guess that there were no further installments and that Haneke pursued a career about Frenchlanguage films too. The first 75 minutes of 71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance just weren't good enough to sit through and watch the thrilling last 15 minutes. Also the way Haneke divided the film into fragments with brief blackscreens as intermissions did not add too much for me. I personally hoped and thought from the IMDb rating that this would be a better film. I do not recommend watching it. Thumbs down. Quite a shame as I quite like the filmmaker's approach and totally enjoyed several of his more recent works.".

Several different seemingly random stories are mixed together. We watch vignettes of varying length. Among them are the stories of a homeless Romanian boy who has illegally crossed into Austria a lovingly married couple adopting a new foster child another married couple at odds with each other an old man starved for attention and a group of frustrated college students. We are told at the beginning that one of these students will murder three people at a bank and we immediately realize that at least some of the other people we have met will be at that bank. I'm not sure how I feel about this technique I'm certainly a bit conflicted. And I'm not 100 sure what I'm supposed to get out of this all. I guess it's always worth being reminded of the unpredictability of life and that at any moment we could disappear from this Earth. Interspersed between the various stories there also appear long clips of the evening news where various atrocities and tragedies are reported in a manner that desensitizes its audience to them. And the climactic event pops up right alongside them. Which of course reminds us also that these atrocities happen to real people a fact that's so easily forgotten when watching the 10 o'clock news. Structurally the film is brilliant. It is similar to what Altman was doing with Nashville. Haneke would improve upon this film with Code Unknown which stands as my favorite of his films and perhaps as my favorite film of the current decade.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hanake's 71 Fragments has been in my estimate misunderstoodat least when discussing the final sequence involving Maximillion and the senseless murders he commits at the bank. Other people have since commented the end crime is without motive in cold blood in other words the work of a psychopathic youngster who has one day suddenly decided to kill a group of people or the mediacreated archetypal teen who after to many bloody films and video games can no longer resist the violent urge these violent images create. What a shallow film this would be if the above were true. Understandably this is the initial reaction the film produces since there doesn't seem to be any motive whatsoever but upon closer inspection the motive is unveiled in a most interesting way it is the motif of the televisions which are transmuted into the Maximillion's motive. There is a constant presence of televisions throughout the filmthey're always on in the backgroundthe film begins with a newscast criticizing Clinton America's golden democrat etcand so this constant this motif must mean something but what? Let us consider the television motif in the following way the television is just an extension of the very technology which gave it life and so that being said we shouldn't limit ourselves by seeing television as an independent object but rather a single object in a system of objects. And incidentally it is in the last scene where the film's focus radically shifts from television from the whole of technology and it is in this shifted focus where Hanake reveals the film's significance. The film is a critique of technology or more specifically the alienating effects of said technology including of course but not limited to television. A simple survey of technological interaction in the final scene might help demonstrate this the boy drives up to an automated fuel dispensary technology and finds that it is out of order if any of the following details are slightly off please forgive me it has been a number of months since I last viewed the film he goes to the ATM machine tech and discovers it is out of order inside a vehicle a driver tech begins to honk tech incessantly at the boy whose car is occupying the automated fuel machinelet's stop for a moment. It should be clear there is a strong presence of technology here what might not be clear is how these technologies are alienating Max or driving him towards his own end. The phenomena taking place here is similar to that of road rage in that the driver who is honking his horn is honking simply because there are no other options other than using it and of course as everyone knows the very sound is enough to cause somebody to erupt. Unless the person is a complete lunatic if you bump into somebody on the sidewalk chances are you'll apologize and move past and continue on your way but in the vehicle no such social nicety exists and so human interaction is reduced to a shrill honk. Inside the bank Max is pushed to the ground as he tries to cut in line so he can pay for his gas but these dehumanized beings think only of themselveshaving already been alienated themselves through technology from their speciesbeingand act selfishly and cruelly towards Max. What occurs afterwards is the culmination of what can simply be regarded as a bad day and personally I can see where this anger comes from. Banks are notoriously stressful as is driving a vehicle and while Max's response is anything other than normal we can at the very least understand why he is acting this way. To say that this crime is unmotivated or senseless is to rob the film of it's meaning. There are people who commit terrible acts without reason but Max isn't one of them. To believe him so is a failure in my opinion to understand the film which is an honest depiction of the effect technology has on individuals a failure to sympathize with Max in the exact same fashion those people leading up to the shooting failed to sympathize with him.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hanake's 71 Fragments has been in my estimate misunderstoodat least when discussing the final sequence involving Maximillion and the senseless murders he commits at the bank. Other people have since commented the end crime is without motive in cold blood in other words the work of a psychopathic youngster who has one day suddenly decided to kill a group of people or the mediacreated archetypal teen who after to many bloody films and video games can no longer resist the violent urge these violent images create. What a shallow film this would be if the above were true. Understandably this is the initial reaction the film produces since there doesn't seem to be any motive whatsoever but upon closer inspection the motive is unveiled in a most interesting way it is the motif of the televisions which are transmuted into the Maximillion's motive. There is a constant presence of televisions throughout the filmthey're always on in the backgroundthe film begins with a newscast criticizing Clinton America's golden democrat etcand so this constant this motif must mean something but what? Let us consider the television motif in the following way the television is just an extension of the very technology which gave it life and so that being said we shouldn't limit ourselves by seeing television as an independent object but rather a single object in a system of objects. And incidentally it is in the last scene where the film's focus radically shifts from television from the whole of technology and it is in this shifted focus where Hanake reveals the film's significance.

I ticked 71 Fragments off last night and was left feeling slightly underwhelmed. It isn't a bad film or anything it's just very pedestrian for Michael. It lacks the emotional power of The Seventh Continent the shock of Benny's Video and the technical skill of Code Unknown yet it resembles all three. If those three films had a hideously depressing threesome then 71 Fragments would probably be its mediocre child.Thankfully it's not as horrifyingly boring as The Castle or the second half of Benny's Video even though the plot description sounds like it could be. It follows about four unrelated characters going about their everyday business. There's a ping ponging student a stowaway boy a depressed couple and a lonely Granddad. Haneke gives us very brief snapshots of their lives which is reminiscent of Code Unknown and Happy End although not as focused or engaging. I didn't find any of it boring just a little bit repetitive. The ending also isn't as shocking as it would like to think it is.So in the end it's a wellmade little film which some interesting themes and the odd great scene however it's not worth going out of your way to find. To my mind Haneke's greatest films are Amour The Piano Teacher and Hidden.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is very much like a late 1940s film noir except it's filmed in the mid 1960s. It has that same edgy dialog and feel to it as private eye Lew Harper goes looking for a missing man. His character is based on Ross McDonald's bestselling P.I. Lew Archer.In Harper all the characters are suspicious and they vary from suave Allan Taggart Robert Wagner to the coquettish late teen Miranda Sampson Pamela Tiffin to a lawyer Albert Graves Arthur Hill who's infatuated with the hot teen and also carries a gun. Then there's the overweight hasbeen entertainer Fay Esterbrook Shelly Winters the druggie jazz singer Betty Fraley Julie Harris the New Age scam artist Claude Strother Martin and a bunch of gangsters and thugs who are the obvious targets. Of them all I though Winters was the biggest hoot.Along the way Newman wins all the verbal bouts but loses the physical contests. He zings everyone with some great putdowns but takes a physical beating a few times too. He sports a nice shiner in the last half of the film.This film will put you smack into the time period when people danced The Frug and referred to cops as the fuzz. People were starting to wear Beatletype haircuts although you'd never find Newman giving in to that counterculture fad. In here at least he's old school tough relentless and suspicious of everyone......which at it turns out is as it should be.The DVD is now part of the Paul Newman Collection and it's shown with a very sharp 2.351 ratio transfer very much showing off Conrad Hall's cinematography. Johnny Mandel's music score adds to the coolness of this film too.".

Is it the classic that The Big Sleep is? No because its world is smaller than that of ChandlerFaulknerHawks even though it glitters more and Smight is a solidly competent director but not an 'auteur'  which works in the film's favor Smight just gets on with the job and tells his story he doesn't stop for extra flourishes.But although all the acting in the film is topquality it is Newman's performance that carries the film over the top witty cynical detached yet with glimpses of passion and commitment Newman uses Harper to define prehippie cool once and for all.Historical note although this is not TheMalteseFalcon classic noir film the detective film was believed to be a genre of the past at best fodder for bad TV when this came out. Harper kept alive what many thought a dead tradition. The reviewer who wrote that this film made the Elliot Gould Long Goodbye possible is right on the money and when nine years later Jack Nicholson starred in Polanski's tribute to the genre  Chinatown  it was Newman's performance here that he is referencing not Bogart. That makes this an important film and one should give a second look to a film that influenced so many others.".

No because its world is smaller than that of ChandlerFaulknerHawks even though it glitters more and Smight is a solidly competent director but not an 'auteur'  which works in the film's favor Smight just gets on with the job and tells his story he doesn't stop for extra flourishes.But although all the acting in the film is topquality it is Newman's performance that carries the film over the top witty cynical detached yet with glimpses of passion and commitment Newman uses Harper to define prehippie cool once and for all.Historical note although this is not TheMalteseFalcon classic noir film the detective film was believed to be a genre of the past at best fodder for bad TV when this came out. Harper kept alive what many thought a dead tradition. The reviewer who wrote that this film made the Elliot Gould Long Goodbye possible is right on the money and when nine years later Jack Nicholson starred in Polanski's tribute to the genre  Chinatown  it was Newman's performance here that he is referencing not Bogart. That makes this an important film and one should give a second look to a film that influenced so many others.";

Harper is more acerbic than Macdonald's Lew Archer and the novel of course fleshes out the characters and their motives a little better. But I think the movie stands up pretty well by itself. It has an outstanding supporting cast and except for Pamela Tiffin the acting is good with high marks especially for Paul Newman and in my opinion Arthur Hill. The photography is gorgeous and I can listen all night to any music by Johnny Mandel. All that and those great oneliners by Newman! I'd give it a 7 or 8 out of ten.".

	schema:headline " Bluesy Blueprint For Butch?";
	schema:reviewBody "Paul Newman was three years away from Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid when he starred in this a similarly breezy caper flick employing the same writer and cinematographer as would Butch. But Harper tries too hard to be cool falling short both as story and character study.Lew Harper Newman is down to recycling used coffee filters and waiting for his wife's divorce to come through when he gets a plum assignment Find a rich drunk named Sampson with a talent for making enemies. Suspects include his convalescent wife Lauren Bacall his beautiful daughter Pamela Tiffin his private pilot Robert Wagner and his tipsy astrologer Shelley Winters. Harper's also trying to reconnect with his wife Janet Leigh even though he is unable to take their relationship seriously.Watching Newman play cutup is a lot of fun and Harper coasts on its sunny charm  for a while. Harper's a new type of detective who chews gum instead of cigars tools around in a tiny twotone car and ignores the hottie daughter for a tray of finger food. With a little luck we'll all be bombed by suppertime is Harper telling someone he's about to crack the case.Two things hold Harper back both major One is the story is way too underbaked. There's a kidnapping at the center of the story and then a second apparently unrelated bit of business involving Mexicans smuggled over the California border which throws more suspicious folks into the mix. How the two tie in is never clear except that Harper stumbles across one while investigating the other and has to deal with both. Neither case generates much intrigue  what you get is a lot of cars driving fast and Harper getting punched around rote business without a clear connecting story.The second major problem for which I blame director Jack Smight is the film's harsh tonal shift. It goes from being a somewhat lighthearted takeoff on a noir mystery to a hardboiled film in its own right with Julie Harris overplaying the part of a sad junkie and Harper himself betraying his true colors as a GradeZ stinker. Conrad Hall's lenswork and Johnny Mandel's theme music remain zippy and bright however and William Goldman's script still goes for the punchlines even as the body count rises and Harper looks ready to throw himself in the Pacific Ocean.Newman established himself in the 1960s as the ultimate antihero and his take on Harper gives us more of the same only with an effort at comedy he sometimes overplays. He grimaces doubletakes winks snorts snickers and spits out enough gum to plaster the San Andreas Fault. He seems to have fun though and watching him is fun at least in the first half with Tiffin and Wagner presenting his best straight men.Do you think I'm attractive? Tiffin asks Harper while lounging on a bed.You're young rich and beautiful and my wife's divorcing me Harper answers. What do you think I think?For his part Wagner's character helps Harper out of a jam and banters with the guy. Harper calls him Beauty a heckuva thing for Newman to call anyone but their chemistry works at least until the film turns dark and weird and even Strother Martin as a kooky New Age preacher man can't force a smile. Hey you think if Wagner grew a moustache dyed his hair blond and hung around for more than a few scenes he and Newman could have made something fun out of this?".

	onyx:emotionText "Paul Newman was three years away from Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid when he starred in this a similarly breezy caper flick employing the same writer and cinematographer as would Butch. But Harper tries too hard to be cool falling short both as story and character study.Lew Harper Newman is down to recycling used coffee filters and waiting for his wife's divorce to come through when he gets a plum assignment Find a rich drunk named Sampson with a talent for making enemies. Suspects include his convalescent wife Lauren Bacall his beautiful daughter Pamela Tiffin his private pilot Robert Wagner and his tipsy astrologer Shelley Winters. Harper's also trying to reconnect with his wife Janet Leigh even though he is unable to take their relationship seriously.Watching Newman play cutup is a lot of fun and Harper coasts on its sunny charm  for a while. Harper's a new type of detective who chews gum instead of cigars tools around in a tiny twotone car and ignores the hottie daughter for a tray of finger food. With a little luck we'll all be bombed by suppertime is Harper telling someone he's about to crack the case.Two things hold Harper back both major One is the story is way too underbaked. There's a kidnapping at the center of the story and then a second apparently unrelated bit of business involving Mexicans smuggled over the California border which throws more suspicious folks into the mix. How the two tie in is never clear except that Harper stumbles across one while investigating the other and has to deal with both. Neither case generates much intrigue  what you get is a lot of cars driving fast and Harper getting punched around rote business without a clear connecting story.The second major problem for which I blame director Jack Smight is the film's harsh tonal shift. It goes from being a somewhat lighthearted takeoff on a noir mystery to a hardboiled film in its own right with Julie Harris overplaying the part of a sad junkie and Harper himself betraying his true colors as a GradeZ stinker. Conrad Hall's lenswork and Johnny Mandel's theme music remain zippy and bright however and William Goldman's script still goes for the punchlines even as the body count rises and Harper looks ready to throw himself in the Pacific Ocean.Newman established himself in the 1960s as the ultimate antihero and his take on Harper gives us more of the same only with an effort at comedy he sometimes overplays. He grimaces doubletakes winks snorts snickers and spits out enough gum to plaster the San Andreas Fault. He seems to have fun though and watching him is fun at least in the first half with Tiffin and Wagner presenting his best straight men.Do you think I'm attractive? Tiffin asks Harper while lounging on a bed.You're young rich and beautiful and my wife's divorcing me Harper answers. What do you think I think?For his part Wagner's character helps Harper out of a jam and banters with the guy. Harper calls him Beauty a heckuva thing for Newman to call anyone but their chemistry works at least until the film turns dark and weird and even Strother Martin as a kooky New Age preacher man can't force a smile. Hey you think if Wagner grew a moustache dyed his hair blond and hung around for more than a few scenes he and Newman could have made something fun out of this?";

	schema:reviewBody "It ought to have everything going for it. What a cast! And they're all good  with Paul Newman's Lou Harper at the top of his game and somewhere closer to her usual norm Pamela Tiffen. Newman's performance is among his best. He's a gumchewing cynical PI who's determined the find the truth behind the disappearance of millionaire Sampson. He has all the necessary tics nudges winks and shrugs. And he registers exquisite pain when somebody clobbers him. There is for instance a scene in which a big thug named Puddler sucker punches Newman in a bar then takes him out back and begins to deliver one or two heavy deliberately placed body blows. R. J. Wagner sneaks up on Puddler knocks him out then gaily begins to help Newman walk back to his car. But Newman groans and leans against the wall puffing and holding his belly and begs Wagner Wait a minute. A less imaginative actor would have had the character shake his head a few times to clear it then stride off snapping out orders.Shelly Winters is equally good in a comic role as an overripe overthehill exmovie star and alcoholic. I can't imagine anyone doing better than Winters when she's berating a hotel orchestra for not playing La Cucaracha shouting that they can't be REAL Mescins or they'd have their guitars and then stumbling off the platform. Shelly Winters is often nailed for spoiling the pictures she's in but I'm not sure why. Her whining evokes both irritation and pathos. She's brought some pizazz to some other films she's been in too. Ham should always be considered a part of any proper buffet.So why doesn't the picture come together? Why is the sum less than its parts. Where is the subtrahend? It has a flattish madeforTV quality. Settings are all comfortably upscale as in an episode of Colombo. The L.A. locations seem to be carefully chosen but because of the photography or Mandel's belowaverage score they have little impact. Compare Chinatown or Farewell My Lovely. William Goldman's script tries for the telling wisecrack Only cream and bastards rise but there aren't enough of them and they're mostly cracks without wit. The best repartee is between Lauren Bacall and Pamela Tiffen two women who hate one another and delight in mutual insults. I love your wrinkles. I revel in them. Still Goldman's script does manage to hold together a plot that is bilaterally symmetrical. On the one hand Newman is hired to rescue the kidnapped millionaire Samson and save the half million paid for his return. On the other hand Newman stumbles into an unrelated plot having to do with the smuggling of illegal aliens. The two stories have absolutely nothing to do with one another until more than halfway through the film when Newman alerts one gang to the operations of the other. It's all pretty easy to get lost in especially when so many disparate characters are involved.The plot lacks an engine too. I didn't believe for a moment that Newman was genuinely dedicated to his craft that it was a point of pride with him to crack this thing as he puts it. Humphrey Bogart was a cynical wisecracking PI in The Maltese Falcon but what was driving him as we discover at the end of the film was the murder of his partner Miles Archer. Certainly concern about the fate of the kidnapped rich guy isn't much of a motive. We never even meet him and everybody hates him anyway.What drives Newman's character? Nothing that we can discover. His marriage is a disaster he lives in his office he drives a beatup car he has practically no friends. In fact when you come right down to it Newman is not a particularly admirable guy in this film. He has a nasty habit of using people. He gets Winters' weak character drunk and then insults her as she lies passed out. He charms some information out of a goodnatured barmaid with his New York accent and when he's finished with her blows her off by asking directly Where's the boss? and her face falls with the realization that she's been had. He deliberately lies to his emotionally vulnerable but estranged wife from whom he gets some sympathy and a night in bed before leaving her flat the next morning. He in turn has no sympathy for anyone else.And then there's the end of the film a freeze frame that leaves us wondering whether Newman will turn his only friend Arthur Hill over to the police or whether Hill will shoot to stop him. The technique may be an integral part of the movie as it is in The Four Hundred Blows in which a delinquent child is frozen while looking at the camera as if waiting for the audience to judge him. Or it may as in this case be an arbitrary gesture a way of ending a movie that nobody could think of a good ending for. You know though having said that I still prefer an ending like this to the phenomenal shootouts that have since become so commonplace.See it for the performances.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Newman's first foray into detective playing came after Frank Sinatra had turned the role down. Quite what the other blue eyes would have done with the material is anyones guess but it's hard to think he could have been as effortlessly cool and have the comic nous that Newman puts into Lew Harper. Whilst I wouldn't go so far as saying that Harper revitalised a faltering detective genre I do however think it's fair to say that it stands as one of the genres most important post 50s entries. Harper has a bit of everything a dynamite leading performance a tricksy plot full of suspicious and near bonkers characters cool locations dames of all shapes ages and sizes and more tellingly a cracking screenplay that's inventive in structure and sizzles with humour. Hell even the end has a nice touch a conversation piece indeed.With its shades of The Big Sleep and its obvious Raymond Chandler conventions Harper for sure is hardly original. But it's so colourful in more ways than one it is able to hold its head up high and stand on its own two feet as a slickly constructed detective piece for the modern age. That it doffs its cap to those wonderful 40s  50s movies should be applauded not used as a stick to beat it with. From the off we know that Lew Harper may well be a cool dude that looks pretty but he's also the sort of PI that is fallible and is prepared to go low to get his leads. As he fishes out dirty coffee filters from his garbage can to take his morning hit we know we are in the presence of no ordinary detective. Where ever Harper goes he meets interesting characters if they are not sticking a gun or a fist in his face then they want something from him or intend to hinder his progress. The roll call consists of a guntoting attorney Arthur Hill a poolside gigolo Robert Wagner an alcoholic exstarlet who has let herself go Shelley Winters the missing man's horny daughter Pamela Tiffin a jazz loving junkie Julie Harris Harper's estranged wife Janet Leigh and the leader of nutty religious order Temple Of The Clouds Strother Martin. Then there's the secondary characters that file in and out as Harper chases clues hit men bagmen fresh faced cops and mysterious servants. All serving a purpose and giving the excellent Newman scope to act off.Tho Conrad Hall's cinematography is on the money Harper isn't stylish in the film noir tradition in that respect. There's no visual tricks and in truth this is not a film for the action junkie. What it is is damn fine story telling that is acted accordingly and yes it is very noirish in plotting. There's never a dull moment and all scenes are relevant. It's also very funny. Witness Harper's date with Fay Estabrook Newman  Winters are comedy gold. And Harper's phone calls to his estranged wife or simply lap up Martin's hilarious religious berserker turn. But ultimately you want and need a bit of hardness in a plot such as this and we get it as the last third of the film arrives in a ball of gun play and torture. It's a smashing film for those after a slick detective piece driven by a charismatic leading man. 810".

Whilst I wouldn't go so far as saying that Harper revitalised a faltering detective genre I do however think it's fair to say that it stands as one of the genres most important post 50s entries. Harper has a bit of everything a dynamite leading performance a tricksy plot full of suspicious and near bonkers characters cool locations dames of all shapes ages and sizes and more tellingly a cracking screenplay that's inventive in structure and sizzles with humour. Hell even the end has a nice touch a conversation piece indeed.With its shades of The Big Sleep and its obvious Raymond Chandler conventions Harper for sure is hardly original. But it's so colourful in more ways than one it is able to hold its head up high and stand on its own two feet as a slickly constructed detective piece for the modern age. That it doffs its cap to those wonderful 40s  50s movies should be applauded not used as a stick to beat it with. From the off we know that Lew Harper may well be a cool dude that looks pretty but he's also the sort of PI that is fallible and is prepared to go low to get his leads. As he fishes out dirty coffee filters from his garbage can to take his morning hit we know we are in the presence of no ordinary detective. Where ever Harper goes he meets interesting characters if they are not sticking a gun or a fist in his face then they want something from him or intend to hinder his progress. The roll call consists of a guntoting attorney Arthur Hill a poolside gigolo Robert Wagner an alcoholic exstarlet who has let herself go Shelley Winters the missing man's horny daughter Pamela Tiffin a jazz loving junkie Julie Harris Harper's estranged wife Janet Leigh and the leader of nutty religious order Temple Of The Clouds Strother Martin. Then there's the secondary characters that file in and out as Harper chases clues hit men bagmen fresh faced cops and mysterious servants. All serving a purpose and giving the excellent Newman scope to act off.Tho Conrad Hall's cinematography is on the money Harper isn't stylish in the film noir tradition in that respect. There's no visual tricks and in truth this is not a film for the action junkie. What it is is damn fine story telling that is acted accordingly and yes it is very noirish in plotting. There's never a dull moment and all scenes are relevant. It's also very funny. Witness Harper's date with Fay Estabrook Newman  Winters are comedy gold. And Harper's phone calls to his estranged wife or simply lap up Martin's hilarious religious berserker turn. But ultimately you want and need a bit of hardness in a plot such as this and we get it as the last third of the film arrives in a ball of gun play and torture. It's a smashing film for those after a slick detective piece driven by a charismatic leading man. 810";

It has the feeling and ambiance of just about every 70s madeforTV cop drama. Except it lasts twice as long.People said Paul Newman's acting in The Silver Chalice 1954 was bad. That was Oscar material compared to Harper. The sensitive torn up inside young man from Cat On A Hot Tin Roof 1958 and Sweet Bird of Youth 1962 the starryeyed idealist from Exodus 1960 and Hud 1963 fumbles badly as he attempts to field a hardboiled detective role. Mostly he does it through ludicrous mugging and overacting.Julie Harris is equally miscast as an ex ? junkie. She is too beautiful and middleclass looking to be the fungus she is supposed to be portraying. She can deliver the goods emotionwise of course but not believably so in this picture.Shelley Winters is pretty good but I don't know why she took the part. She is nothing but belittled and insulted by all the men who come in contact with her made out to be something so repulsive that nobody in their right mind would go near her. What happened to her? She got FAT! is how she is introduced and it goes downhill from there.In fact the movie is very misogynistic all the way through. You're so oldfashioned I bet you think women belong in the home taunts Tiffin. Not in my home retorts Newman. The only sex he has in the entire film basically amounts to a date rape.The titsandass appeal are provided by Tiffin and Wagner she doing a gogo dance in a brief bikini on a diving board that was imitated by both Goldie Hawn and Pamela Rogers on LaughIn 1967 and he with his Nair'ed chest and plethora of butt shots.There are lots of laughs most of them unintentional. The best is when Strother Martin's bracero cult members rise up out of nowhere like zombies in Night of the Living Dead 1968 or The Omega Man 1971 and surround Newman. He even holds them at bay by swinging a burning torch!Bacall is solid but her part is small. Most enjoyable moment is an exchange of vilifications with Tiffin with Newman kibitzing Puss puss puss from the sidelines.Standing out like a beacon amidst all this mishmosh is Janet Leigh who plays the only character I liked Newman's ex ? wife. Once again her part is rather small but she has the only worthwhile moments in the entire film.Too bad too because with its complex plot and its abundance of quirky characters Harper could have been another Big Sleep. Instead it turned out to be more of a Big Snicker.".

	schema:headline " A 40s Style Detective Story Set In The 60s";
	schema:reviewBody "Harper is a typical 1940s detective story which was based on Ross MacDonald's novel called The Moving Target. It features a quick witted private eye an investigation into the disappearance of an eccentric millionaire and an assortment of characters who between them are involved in drug addiction alcoholism and smuggling people across the border from Mexico. It starts very much in the style of The Big Sleep as the private investigator visits his invalid client in a mansion and gets distracted by his employer's spoiled young stepdaughter.This is also however a 1960s movie which has a number of characteristics which reflect the period in which it was made. Some of these are the presence of bright colours gogo dancing and a guru. The mood of the piece is noticeably more light hearted than would be normal in a 1940s movie and the private eye is also more laid back. The fashions and music reinforce the movie's 60s credentials and overall the blend of 40s and 60s influences work together remarkably well.Lew Harper Paul Newman is hired by the extremely wealthy but crippled Elaine Sampson Lauren Bacall to find her missing husband. Mrs Sampson's very bitter about the way she's been treated by her heavy drinking spouse and assumes that he's probably with another woman. At the Sampson mansion Harper meets the millionaire's airhead daughter Miranda Pamela Tiffin and the family's private pilot Allan Taggart Robert Wagner.A photograph he finds in Sampson's L.A. apartment leads Harper to Fay Estabrook Shelley Winters. She's an overweight alcoholic exactress who Harper charms before going to her apartment where a telephone call provides him with another lead. His further investigations bring him into contact with a junkie nightclub singer called Betty Fraley Julie Harris and a religious cult leader called Claude Strother Martin.Sampson's been kidnapped and the ransom money is duly paid. Trouble follows however when Betty Fraley steals the cash and this leads Harper to suspect that she and Taggart had conspired together to kidnap Sampson. Harper is threatened at gunpoint by Taggart but escapes injury when his old friend Albert Graves Arthur Hill appears on the scene. Fraley later leads Harper to the location where Sampson is being held but then some other unexpected developments follow.Paul Newman is ideal for the lead role which calls for him to adopt a cool casual and laid back style whilst also showing just how quick witted and professional his character really is. His ability to seemingly meet these requirements with consummate ease is very impressive and really enjoyable to watch. Predictably Robert Wagner Shelley Winters and Janet Leigh are also excellent in their roles and Arthur Hill makes a big impression as Harper's lawyer friend who has an enormous crush on Miranda Sampson and great faith in the benefits of isometric exercises.Harper is a movie with a tremendous cast an absorbing plot and a variety of very colourful characters. The dialogue is full of entertaining oneliners and there are also plenty of humorous as well as dramatic moments to enjoy.".

It seems as though disembarked his private aircraft from the airport and vanished.

Newman really wades through the muck on this one as he interviews a range of persons of interest one sleazier than the next. And both the widow who hired him and the missing husband turn out to be pretty sleazy themselves.Paul Newman was really born to play Harper. As much as I liked this one his second go around as Harper in The Drowning Pool was even better. But that's a review for that film.Of the supporting cast I particularly liked Julie Harris as the junkie jazz singer and Strother Martin as leader of a wacko religious cult that has some criminal interests.By the way the ending is left very much up in the air in terms of what knowledge Newman will divulge to the authorities.

He's an alltoofallible smalltime detective who investigates a kidnapping case involving a rich industrialist and lots of ransom money.The plot is very complex and leads Harper into a seamy corner of society interacting with a variety of characters Dwight Troy Robert Webber a human smuggler Fay Estabrook Shelley Winters a former glamour girl turned fat and alcoholic Betty Frales Julie Harris a drugaddicted bar patron who's after the ransom money Claude Strother Martin a phony preacher Miranda Sampson the luscious Pamela Tiffin the kidnapped man's daughter Susan Harper Janet Leigh Harper's frustrated and estranged wife Allan Taggart Robert Wagner a playboy and member of the kidnap gang and many others. There's no happy ending thoughthe kidnapped Ralph Sampson ends up dead. The fate of the big pile of ransom money provides a great twist ending to the film.The cast has many wellknown stars and is uniformly excellent led by Newman of course. His antihero Harper character is always fun to watch. I also loved Shelley Winters' work as the fat hasbeen Fay Estabrook and of course Pamela Tiffin is easy on the eyes. I especially enjoyed Robert Webber's role as the ultraslimy Dwight Troy a contemptible rascal who gets what he deserves toward the end of the movie. The movie moves quickly provides great dialogue and action and showcases Newman as he gracefully moved toward middle age.".

He's an alltoofallible smalltime detective who investigates a kidnapping case involving a rich industrialist and lots of ransom money.The plot is very complex and leads Harper into a seamy corner of society interacting with a variety of characters Dwight Troy Robert Webber a human smuggler Fay Estabrook Shelley Winters a former glamour girl turned fat and alcoholic Betty Frales Julie Harris a drugaddicted bar patron who's after the ransom money Claude Strother Martin a phony preacher Miranda Sampson the luscious Pamela Tiffin the kidnapped man's daughter Susan Harper Janet Leigh Harper's frustrated and estranged wife Allan Taggart Robert Wagner a playboy and member of the kidnap gang and many others. There's no happy ending thoughthe kidnapped Ralph Sampson ends up dead. The fate of the big pile of ransom money provides a great twist ending to the film.The cast has many wellknown stars and is uniformly excellent led by Newman of course. His antihero Harper character is always fun to watch. I also loved Shelley Winters' work as the fat hasbeen Fay Estabrook and of course Pamela Tiffin is easy on the eyes. I especially enjoyed Robert Webber's role as the ultraslimy Dwight Troy a contemptible rascal who gets what he deserves toward the end of the movie. The movie moves quickly provides great dialogue and action and showcases Newman as he gracefully moved toward middle age.";

He sends regular emails to Tina but unknowingly gets responses from Pooja. Through these responses he falls for the girl he thinks is Tina but in reality is Pooja. When he finally realizes the truth tragedy strikes and peoples morals are tried and tested and true love wins.Rani looks fab. She is the embodiment of a sexy lady. She dresses very well can relate to the character and acts very naturally. Kareena is all Kareena and what we have come to expect from her. She is very well suited to the crazy bratty girl remember Po from K3G but falls flat on her face when it comes to emotional and challenging roles. Hrithik is good in the role and has done the role some justice. Support staffs are just part of the background. The songs are good and with the times however the mixed medley is really good to see we should definitely have more of them in movies to come. Overall an entertaining movie but definitely not a classic or a milestone in Indian cinema.".

Add the MAINE PYAR KIYA inspired song parody sequence and end it hurriedly inspired from K2H2 again. Add the regular YASH CHOPRA sauces i.e. melodious music and cool choreography. Garnish it with foreign locales jazzy costumes and grandeur sets. MDK is ready. The CHOPRA restaurant also gives you an extra papad Uday Chopra free of cost.So the story is about 3 friends who are separated in their childhood. Raj Hrithik shifts to London and from there mails regularly to Tina Kareena who isn't much interested in replying. All those emails are replied by Pooja Rani but under the name of Tina Well I suppose the net wasn't introduced in India about 15 years from now. Raj comes to India and gradually falls in love with Tina but when he realizes that all those letters were written by Pooja his heart suddenly flips over towards her in less than a second like they say Hrithik Ki Tarah o sorry girgit Ki Tarah rang badal na. Then starts the triangle. Finally friends become lovers and lovers become friends. And when it comes to Hindi cinema there isn't much difference between the two terms.Filmcriticturneddirector Kunal Kohli handles many sequences with sensitivity but relies too heavily on the tried and tested stuff. Like the climax that shows a pinch full of sindoor falling on Rani's forehead appears way too clichd. Moreover Words like farz vaada saccha pyar qurbani are bandied about so many times that they lose their significance.Finally the movie clearly belongs to Rani Mukherjee who has the meatiest role comparatively and does full justice to it. Hrithik is good but suffers from Shahrukh hangover at times. Kareena's role is just an extension of what she did in K3G.Recommended only for the sweetfilm toothed.".

It focusses on the friendship and subsequent love triangle of three childhood pals.....Raj Tina and Pooja. As one of them pithily puts it......pyar dosti hai....oh wait sorry that was dil to pagal hai. Moving on....so mdk has this cool triangle between the scantily clad  nisha the chopra version of the bharatiya nari  pooja and the gap clad  rahul.....oops that was also dil to pagal hai but you get the drift. Since the plot is redundant let's talk exciting stuff like this wonderful pseudo antakshari routine between sridevi anil kapoor and anupam kher......my bad that was lamhe. Okay song picturisations then.....shot beautifully atop snowclad mountains  like every yash chopra movie since 1988 around the red telephone boxes and escalators of london  see ddlj and k3g for more details and an exciting on stage number see kkhh for a slight but better variation on the same. Since nothing else is particularly new.....let's talk climax which features this awesome concept of the big man on top......yes God himself dropping in to sort matters out.....and there's this cute family dog....no no that's hahk....ok well mdk climax is hahk without the dog. Well atleast kunal kohli moved on to steal ideas from another banner instead of sticking with yash raj traditions.MDK is not a bad movie but it's a movie we've all seen over and over again in some form or the other. The fact that it liberally borrows ideas from other famous yash raj produced movies does not help since all of the other movies are close to classics with characters songs and sequences that still resonate with moviegoers. Even the English original The Truth about Cats and Dogs which itself is inspired from Cyrano de Bergerac was no Oscar contender....but it was a well made romantic comedy exuding warmth and goodness which is something one cannot say for MDK.The story is nothing to write home about neither are the songs the direction the cinematography or even the acting. Kareena plays a watered down version of Poo Rani plays a longer version of the saintly but soon dead Tina and Hrithik well he does what he's being paid pots of money to do  exude charisma shake a shapely leg or two and twinkle at the ladies. The biggest pity is these are all actors who are capable of much more yet they settle for poor copies of roles they themselves have played before. And that's perhaps is the final word on MDK itself. It's a poor copy of movies made before by the same production house and that's a huge pity because the banner itself is capable of so much more.So do you watch it.......i wouldn't reccomend it.....go rent ddlj kkhh hahk even qsqt and mpk and see what romance is truly about.....why settle for a cheap copy when the original is just a movie rental away".

Another minor gripe was that we were supposed to find Pooja to be nowhere near as beautiful as Tina but Rani Mukherjee is stunning and and this concept was a little too unbelievable.Hrithik Roshan has battled the critics for the past two years aside from K3G  and has finally netted another decent role to perform and this should restore him to Not Finished Status He is a decent actor and I would be hard pressed to identify anyone else in Bollywood that can dance as well his movements are as graceful and natural as any man can muster  He is the human slinky!Kareena although named Tina Swapping her K3G name for Rani's KKHH name manages to bring back her Pooja role from K3G and until the last reel is note very appealing in anything other than physically the character finally starts doing some things that show a little depth later in the film and by the end you actually like her. Providing you aren't Amisha Patel.Rani Mukherjee has finally been given a major role that she deserves no she isn't the acting genius that her cousin Kajol has proven to be but that doesn't keep her from continuously delivering solid performances regardless of the size of the role and screen time. This film is no exception. Rani plays the role very well and she seems to be headed to being a big star. As people may know Rani is a sweet person who can't manage to say anything bad about anyone and I wish her all the best she deserves it.So if you are an actor your father is the producer and your brother is a screen writer do you think you will find trouble getting a role of course not Uday Chopra comes into the movie halfway through and while I really want to like him and his performance I find that every time Uday is onscreen in this film or others he looks like he is having too much fun In other words he looks like he is acting rather than getting lost in his character like the other performers. This sometimes is distracting and brings down a scene. I think that eventually someone will clue him onto this fact and he will become much more believable. But note until the day that someone has the nerve to tell the son of one of the most successful men in Mumbai...Great soundtrack In some of the musical numbers choreography seemed nonexistent but other scenes such as the Medley of Chopra hits were done very well.Overall the movie was fun I would give it a 7.5 out of 10 while not perfect it was an enjoyable film and perhaps will get the critics to chup chup Shut up about Hrithik for a while.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS   SPOILERS 'Mujhse Dosti Karogi' is typically a teen movie. If this were a Hollywood movie it would have most likely starred someone like Freddie Prinze Jr. or Sarah Michelle Gellar or both. The only difference being that they can actually just pass off being in their late teens early twenties.All in all this movie is quite entertaining. The story revolves around three teens Raj Pooja and Tina who are seperated when Raj leaves with his parents to Britain. Raj has a crush on Tina and stays in contact with her through email. Tina is bored with Raj so smitten Pooja emails Raj in Tina's name. After a decade or so Raj returns and the problems ensue. Pooja doesn't want to admit she wrote the emails but it doesn't matter anyway because Raj falls head over heels with the much more beautiful Tina. Personally I think Pooja Rani Mukherjee is much hotter than Tina Kareena Kapoor. Until of course he finds out that Pooja wrote the emails.First of all let me say I loved Rani in this movie. Her character was truly endearing. Which made it even worse she ended up with a schmuck like Hritik who falls in and out of love at the drop of a hat and manages to blaim everything on the person who has loved him his entire life. POSSIBLE SPOILER When he reproaches Pooja for lying to him because he is really in love with her I wanted to smack him. But naturally Pooja wouldn't just roll over and gave him good by telling him that he's the one who didn't recognise her as the person who had been sending the emails. After all he had told her that when they would meet his heart would recognise hers... aaahhh...As far as the acting goes like I said Rani was brilliant. Hritik was so so. It's quite remarkable that whenever Hritik tries to display emotions like anger or grief he looks like his eyes are about to pop out of his head his head is then gonna explode and he wants to smack someone elses head into a wall. I much rather prefer Shah Rukh Khan who when displaying grief or anger stays admirably calm and controlled and turns on the puppy dog eyes. As far as Kareena is concerned her acting is good except she comes across as a real lightbulb as usual. But I would like to give her the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps her character Tina is a lightbulb in which case Kareena's acting was really good. All in all this movie is quite enjoyable if you don't mind a Bollywood teen movie. It would have been nice if it had a more original ending for instance if Rani in the end fell madly in love with Uday Chopra and let Hritik and Kareena make each other miserable.5 stars".

The story revolves around three teens Raj Pooja and Tina who are seperated when Raj leaves with his parents to Britain. Raj has a crush on Tina and stays in contact with her through email. Tina is bored with Raj so smitten Pooja emails Raj in Tina's name. After a decade or so Raj returns and the problems ensue. Pooja doesn't want to admit she wrote the emails but it doesn't matter anyway because Raj falls head over heels with the much more beautiful Tina. Personally I think Pooja Rani Mukherjee is much hotter than Tina Kareena Kapoor. Until of course he finds out that Pooja wrote the emails.First of all let me say I loved Rani in this movie. Her character was truly endearing. Which made it even worse she ended up with a schmuck like Hritik who falls in and out of love at the drop of a hat and manages to blaim everything on the person who has loved him his entire life. POSSIBLE SPOILER When he reproaches Pooja for lying to him because he is really in love with her I wanted to smack him. But naturally Pooja wouldn't just roll over and gave him good by telling him that he's the one who didn't recognise her as the person who had been sending the emails. After all he had told her that when they would meet his heart would recognise hers... aaahhh...As far as the acting goes like I said Rani was brilliant. Hritik was so so. It's quite remarkable that whenever Hritik tries to display emotions like anger or grief he looks like his eyes are about to pop out of his head his head is then gonna explode and he wants to smack someone elses head into a wall. I much rather prefer Shah Rukh Khan who when displaying grief or anger stays admirably calm and controlled and turns on the puppy dog eyes. As far as Kareena is concerned her acting is good except she comes across as a real lightbulb as usual. But I would like to give her the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps her character Tina is a lightbulb in which case Kareena's acting was really good. All in all this movie is quite enjoyable if you don't mind a Bollywood teen movie. It would have been nice if it had a more original ending for instance if Rani in the end fell madly in love with Uday Chopra and let Hritik and Kareena make each other miserable.5 stars";

	schema:reviewBody "Yashraj is considered to be the most prime bollywood production house but however their few films are really notable. Mujhse Dosti Karoge released in 2002 starring Hrithik Roshan who was still trying to gain his foothold he had a superhit debut but post that his career was going downhill this film took it further down Kareena was going through a repetitive Poo Phase while Rani too was struggling. The film like most Yashraj films is shot abroad larger then life sets characters are dressed stylishly whether there are poor or rich. This film was also directed by Kunal Kohli who was a film critic before perhaps after watching this film he would never criticise a film again. The storyline is pretty ordinary Raj Pooja and Tina are childhood friends played by Hrithik Rani and Kareena respectively Raj goes abroad but promises that he will keep in touch through internetin 1992 10 years since the film is set. How realistic YRF films are!!!!! Anywayz when they get old after years Raj comes back The twist in the tale is it was Rani's character chatting with Hrithik whom he mistakes to be Kareena and then some typical song n dance till the twist is revealed. The film follows a predictable format and has clichs and melodrama. Nothing really worthwhile to speak about. The director also adds Uday Chopra as the second lead the Salman Khan kinda character from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. The climax is perhaps the worst climaxes in a love triangleDirection is nothing great thank god Kunal gave us Hum Tum after 2 years Music was typical Yrf though Jaane Dil Mein is decent the medley leaves a lot to be desiredHrithik Roshan was repeating himself film after film except Mission Kashmir FIZA though he plays well in emotional scenes yet he needed a makeover Rani Mukherjee gets the meatiest part and does a good job Kareena Kapoor was getting irritating with her same Poo act she did over and over again she gets also the lesser role Uday Chopra gets a sidey role and is nothing great Kiran Kumar Satish Shah and others are okay".

The story was nothing new in fact it was very clichd. The writer attempted a new style but fell flat. The performances the characterization was a huge drawback. Kareena's role was completely wasted. Her acting also was okay. Rani was good but not great. Hrithik is a good actor and tried his best but the because of the disaster screenplay and poor direction Hrithik could not bring out his true potential. But he was still good. The length is also very long I must say I watched this film twice and both times I almost died from boredom. This film was was a flop at the box office. I see a lot of people praising this film. And I see nobody praising good films of Hrithik's like Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne lage and Na tum jano na hum which were released the same year as Mujhse Dosti Karoge but also flopped. Those films were amazing and Mujhse Dosti karoge is trash compared to those films. Take my advice as a hrithik fan watch his every film except for this one. listen to the songs though.".

I love watching him when he actsas I see..he looks more outstanding! Nowadays he's the best actor i have ever seen after Shahrukh Khan.I may say so Hritik is the one actor who becomes popular in Bombay. But the spoiler here in this film is Rani Mukherjeee..SPOILER seeshe absolutely doesn't match with Hritik..I watched it many times and I was realized while Rani's acting as a Pooja with Hritik she seemed more an awkward and she's thunderous because she never acts with hritik before..and i wanna say again..she does not match with Hritik anywaythat's the point!What's up with Rani? So the conclusion is she should have played more stronger anyway or the best i think she shouldn't have acted with Hritik anymore! So has anyone seen Rani played film with Hritik afterward? For meshe has no attraction yet like the others actress have and she doesn't play well like the others actress do. what i could say about Kareena..yes she's hot and gorgeous girl and she plays well even though she's youngactress to take part more bollywood films by now. Rani is a person who has to be change in her stylecharacter and changed how to play more stronger in others film next time! or might be not! She has no attraction i may thought!".

Still Oulette does a good job in leading us through this dash through campus with the hideous shedemon behind us. The idea of the split demonnormal girl is intriguing and the lovely Maria Ford is convincing as the 300yearold coed. Mark Kinsey Stephenson is again solid as the scholarly and fearless Randolph Carter. Doesn't every college English Department have a senior bookworm like this?My only complaintand this is one I might not have even thought of before returning to grad schoolis that the professors are all Scooby Dooish allknowing' doctors. Professor Warren John RhysDavies apparently is an oral folklore specialist within the English Departmentunless he is possibly in sociology or some similar field. For him to have a passing knowledge of quantum physics is not unthinkable. For him to look at a mutilated body and tell claw marks from incisor marks is stretching it considerably. For a literature professor to be running around with a portable microbiology lab in his little black pouch though and setting up a microscope etc. in a dank dark cave and making glib pronouncements about the blood however is akin to no one suspecting Old Hank' or whoever as being the Scooby Doo villain. Folks as one who is around professors every day and who hopes to BE a college history professor in a couple of years I can attest that the average English or history professor barely understands how to connect to the Internet or operate PowerPoint let alone set up a miniscience lab in a dark cave in five minutes!This one is okay but I need to see the original again.

Seeking guidance from an authoritative figure he can trust and respect Carter goes to Professor WarrenJohn RhysDavies a delightful presencewhose field of expertise in in ancient history among other things. On an expedition where the beast was seen nearby Carter Eliot  Warren find the entrance to an underground tunnel in an ancient graveyard which leads to the prison of the shebeast whose caught in a thicket of heavy sticks and treebranches. Having found the Necronomicon in Winthrope's home Carter and Warren discover that the shebeast is actually Winthrope's beautiful daughter AlydaMaria Fordinvaded by the demonic spirit of an evil winged creature. Warren concocts a successful plan to release Alyda of the evil creature by using insulin tricking the monster into believing that the human host was dying. The spirit fleeing Alyda she is awakened to a brand new world..but the demonic winged creature with sharp fingernails that rip human flesh easily wishes to retrieve it's host and will kill anyone who stands in her way. After Warren discovers too late that the creature has remained in the tunnel Carter and Eliot will attempt to find Alyda help..she was kept in an attic during her young life and only knows the Cthulu language taught to her by popswhile staying one step ahead of danger. Unfortunately students of Miskatonic University and Arkham County's finest will not be so lucky as the demonic winged creature goes on a killing spree ripping the throats of everyone it comes in contact with. The creature seems impervious to the bullets fired from guns as it pursues Alyda with an intense will. What will Carter do to help keep Alyda safe from harm? Can he stop the beast from infiltrating the body of Alyda once again? Inspired by the works of Lovecraft like a lot of horror films coming out in the late 80's and early 90's The Unnamable II is more of a monster movie. The demonic creature's rampage is not as gory as I would've liked with a great many of the murders occurring offscreen. Too bad. But substituting those potential thrills is Maria Ford practically naked under long hair..which amazingly keeps her breasts hiddenfor nearly the entire film only wearing a gown when a female student pal of Carter's influences her into putting it on by disrobing. The love that strengthens between Carter and Alyda is rather sweet and Ford is adorable and convincing as a newborn pup introduced to a new world she's never known. The creature itself is none other than sex siren Julie Strain unrecognizable under the scary makeup and costume. While there's little actual violence shown you are treated to the creature's hand going through a man's chest. And there is some fantastic makeup grue displaying ripped necks. Stephenson as the nerdy intellectual with craziness and chaos all around him wisely plays his character completely straight displaying a calm and reserve needed by the leader in charge of keeping Alyda from danger. David Warner is rather wasted in a cameo as Miskatonic University's Chancellor who warns Carter to not pursue the creature. Most of the other characters are fodder for the beast to destroy. Spirited direction from JeanPaul Ouellette..this is definitely an improvement over the first film which is more of a slasher flick a nifty creature with cool wings and a likable cast really enhance what could've just been yet another Lovecraft adaptation that missed the mark. The climax takes place in the Miskatonic library as Carter and Alyda have ran out of places to hide discovering the missing pages of the Necronomicon within a secret room of books thanks to an air conditioning duct. The use of a wooden chair in battling the demonic creature when attempting to invade Alyda's body is kind of neat. Truth be told though my favorite scene would have to be when Alyda discovers a bed and is caressing her naked body throughout it..Ford's sensuality even while portraying an innocent is very present.".

Some things happen offscreen but there a few twisted and ravaging acts caught. The slick tone seemed to be aiming for pulpy fun in a fastmoving chase format than the simmering atmospheric jolts in a confined setting and for most part it works.Returning characters Randolph Carter exaggeratedly acted by Mark Kinsey Stephenson and Eliot Damon Howard a solid Charles Klausmeyer make for a fruitful chemistry as they must do battle again with the demon with no name. Along for the ride is John RhysDavies and Maria Ford who spends plenty of screen time in the nude under her flowing long hair is very convincing in her part. Julie Strain is the lucky one who gets suited up in the creatively effective makeup FX of the titular demon and David Warner also gets in the act but with very little in the way to do.This time around the story with a consistently witty script holds a little more substance and character to its framework where modern science and ancient folklore come to terms and explores the possibilities than reverting to a simple stalk n' slash exercise. After the leaving the tunnels under the Winthrop house this time the action mainly occurs in the illustrative backdrop of the University grounds. The openness of it didn't do much in the favor of holding suspense but the atmosphere is glum and its straightlaced quirkiness lends well.".

I just had to purchase it on DVD when I had the chance.I loved the story and found it to be thrilling and good. It drew from the Lovecraft universe in a good way and I was nailed to my chair throughout the entire movie and it still does whenever I put it into the DVD player.I have watched this movie maybe 5 or 6 times over the years and never gotten tired of it. Of course a certain amount of time have to pass before you put this one in the DVD player again.When I watched this for the first time I was fairly unfamiliar with John RhysDavies but found his acting here to be believable and good. And this movie also introduced me to Maria Ford which I must say is a plus for this movie.The atmosphere of the movie is dark and brooding which works well throughout the entire feature. Of course the effects are sort of bad in today's standards but back then they were great. Especially for a fairly low budget movie. I liked the makeup on the creature and were surprised to find out that it was Julie Strain underneath it.If you like the work of Lovecraft and have a taste for the movies based on Lovecraft's work then you should not let this movie pass you by. Even today this movie is worth watching. Even though Jeffrey Combs is not in this Lovecraftbased movie it is still providing good entertainment. It has a good solid story no real boring moments throughout the length of the movie and I think it is a must have in any horror fan's DVD collection.".

It drew from the Lovecraft universe in a good way and I was nailed to my chair throughout the entire movie and it still does whenever I put it into the DVD player.I have watched this movie maybe 5 or 6 times over the years and never gotten tired of it. Of course a certain amount of time have to pass before you put this one in the DVD player again.When I watched this for the first time I was fairly unfamiliar with John RhysDavies but found his acting here to be believable and good. And this movie also introduced me to Maria Ford which I must say is a plus for this movie.The atmosphere of the movie is dark and brooding which works well throughout the entire feature. Of course the effects are sort of bad in today's standards but back then they were great. Especially for a fairly low budget movie. I liked the makeup on the creature and were surprised to find out that it was Julie Strain underneath it.If you like the work of Lovecraft and have a taste for the movies based on Lovecraft's work then you should not let this movie pass you by. Even today this movie is worth watching. Even though Jeffrey Combs is not in this Lovecraftbased movie it is still providing good entertainment. It has a good solid story no real boring moments throughout the length of the movie and I think it is a must have in any horror fan's DVD collection.";

It flirts with quantum physics and other silly theories even adding some comedic scenes to the events which oddly enough do work. John RhysDavies is amusing as always but lasts only half the movie. The always reliable David Warner has a cameo. Being a creature feature the creature design worn by actress Julie Strain lives up to the expectations. The story picks up right after the events of the first film and meanders in slightly different directions this time. Just like the first film which was much more a slasherorientated effort this sequel's hardly a masterpiece. But it's got some spirited moments a handful of nasty kills and it remains a fun entertaining watch nonetheless. The beautiful Maria Ford steals most of the show here as she's walking around completely nude during half of the movie's running time. Furthermore The Unnamable II stays true to the spirit of Lovecraft with a lot of amusing inside references to his works. So fans should be pleased since a lot worse Lovecraft adaptations have been made throughout the years.".

	schema:reviewBody "This adequate sequel follows the HALLOWEEN 2 route of being set just minutes after the events of the first one. Whereas THE UNNAMABLE was a typical let's all go to the haunted house and get killed by the monster onebyone entry in the teenage slasher genre this sequel tries to be more as it expounds on the original story and also adds in plenty of false science and mumbojumbo to make things sound good. In fact this kind of ridiculous wouldbe science told in a straightfaced manner is one of the things I love to hear. Who would have realised that by injecting an evil demon with insulin it would cause the girl's soul to separate from the monster? One thing the film does lack is the spooky atmosphere which the first film provided. This is because after the initial setup the characters move from place to brightlylit place to escape from the creature following them. The pacing isn't all that good either with sections towards the end where nothing much happens for half an hour or so. The film covers a lot of areas with romance violence science fiction and horror but by spreading itself to cover all genres it also appears to be toned down. For instance there's none of the brutal gore which made the first film such an eye opener. Some people get slashed apart and ripped but it's never very gruesome.Instead we have a beautiful girl played by Bmovie regular Maria Ford wandering around naked for much of the film perverts beware this is no LIFEFORCE  the girl has long long hair in this case plus lots of light comedy stuff to make things supposedly enjoyable. And that's the trouble because this just isn't as enjoyable as the first. The problem is that the film falls apart after the initial setup which is in itself good jumping from one silly scene to another until the headscratching climax which makes you think they couldn't think of any other way to end the film.Okay so the budget is higher and the special effects are notably better including lots of crackling energy and an improved rubber suit but the creepy magic of the first film is missing. It's no fault of the actors either as they all do an okay job. Stephenson is a lot better in his role here he's not as irritating and he has fun with his weird mannerisms. The character of Howard returns from the first but is played by another actor however as he is completely identical to the first Howard you wouldn't realise. Alexandra Durrell is nowhere to be seen in the film but bizarrely she acted as an associate producer instead. Maria Ford is pretty good as the innocent girl caught up in a world she doesn't recognise or understand while good old David Warner cameos as the school's chancellor in one scene. Kudos goes to John RhysDavies who puts in a good performance as the nice professor who unfortunately gets killed early on which is a shame as I'd have liked to have seen more of his character.If you liked the first film then you will probably enjoy this one but there just isn't enough incident to propel it along. Instead it moves on like some secondrate slasher killing off minor characters every once in a while to make things more interesting. Okay to watch but not that good really when you think about it.".

It turns out the Unnamable has a name after all it's Alyda. Somehow John RhysDavies and Mark Kinsey Stephenson separate the real Alyda from the demon. The real Alyda is played by Maria Ford who spends most of the movie naked while the demon is played by Julie Strain who we never see out of the ugly makeup. Maimings and killings result as the demon chases Alyda all over Miskatonic campus. Stuart Gordon this is not. Hell Brian Yuzna this is not. Unnamable II clocks in at 104 minutes which is just ridiculous considering that so much should have been trimmed. Not could have been SHOULD have been. There are completely unnecessary characters David Warner has a three second cameo that goes nowhere boring exposition galore and so much more. Watch Reanimator again instead.".

	schema:headline " Much more enjoyable than the first but more plot flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was much more original than the first movie which was just a typical teens get killed in an old house movie. This one took a new approach with a bit more humor a fresher plot and a more entertaining atmosphere. I enjoyed this a lot more than the original but unfortunately this film had a few problems. If you have not seen the movie yet and want to be surprised DON'T CONTINUE READING there are SPOILERS ahead. SO still with me I see? Okay. The idea is that the creature has been trapped by tree roots to the wall of an underground cave or something and Randolph now being helped by the dude who played the Professor in Sliders apparently tried to figure out what the most stupid approach to the problem would be. they finally decided that they should use a spell from the spellbook Randolph foundthe Necronomicon in fact a spell which will seperate spirit from flesh. It wasn't until after the spell was cast that one of the characters said aloud Is this a very good idea? I laughed at that one. I don't have a problem with this bit of nonsense though many people would be just that dumb. The main problem I had was the creature is now seperated one half is a beautiful girl and the other half is a monster which is now MANY TIMES MORE POWERFUL than when it was in the body of the girl. Yet the creature was chasing them around the whole time trying to get back into the girl. WHY?! It had MORE STRENGTH FLIGHT etc. Now what would have made sense was if they said the demon had to be in a human body by sunrise or it would be banished back to its dimension. This would have made a beat the clock scenario and also explained why it actually wanted to rejoin the girl and become weaker! The only other problem I had was the ending. It just seemed very phony and cheap. On the other hand if they had done the beat the clock version then the monster could have been beaten by eluding it until sunrise thereby eliminating the really dumb ending they used. Still I enjoyed the film and give it  out of .".

But here I am in 2014 watching a 90s movie that looks more like an 80s movie.Something happened in a house. Bodies are being dragged away. A guy named Howard survived and now he has visions of a creature. A guy named Carter was standing nearby so he's a witness. But he investigates into the house and discovers a scary past involving the Necronomicon. He enlists another professor and of they go into a cave beneath the house. Howard is also with them but he stays outside.Inside the cave they find a creature that's a pairing of a womanthe daughter of the former house ownerand a demon. They manage to separate the two. Carter takes the girl with him to the university. The scholar stays behind researching the demon which ends up killing him. But the girl feels that the demon is going to come after her. And sure enough the demon appears and Carter the girl some friends the cops all have to face the demon.This movie can be credited with one achievement a very questionable one though it stars Maria Ford and Julie Strain in 1992 and yet shows no nudity. Ford is not wearing clothes for a good part of the movie but a huge wig covers up her body. It would have been even a greater annoyance in the 90s when the two ladies where in their softcore heyday.Aside from that major weakness the movie is of course slow 15 minutes longer than it needs to be. It feature some good acting and some poor acting. It has good physical gore and prosthetic effects and some cheesy visual effects. The story is alright but more could have been made of it. And of course a lot more could have been done with such a cast.".

The first one really wasn't too bad and even occasionally entertaining but seriously nobody needed a sequel. And this time writerdirector JeanPaul Ouellette even had a slightly larger budget at his disposal meaning the script is a lot more ambitious and there even was some money left to pay famous Bmovie stars like John RhysDavies and the minuscule cameo appearance of David Warner. Even though part two came out five years after the original we're supposed to not notice that the actors look a lot older and wear their hair in completely different styles. The Unnamable Returns carries on where the first film stopped with Howard and Randolph escaping from the cursed Winthrop house. Notwithstanding the fact they quietly walked away unharmed at the end of the first film they're now being taken away in ambulances and under massive police supervision. Randolph Carter the selfproclaimed expert in demonology returns to the catacombs underneath the house to investigate the origin of the halfwomanhalfdemoniccreature along with his university professor John RhysDavies. When they find it they do what every rational scientist would do and inject the creature with insulin to separate the woman from the demon. Apparently it works as the demon assumes something's wrong with the body and exits leaving only the beautiful host Alyda. Randolph takes the 200yearold naked beauty back to the dormitory but the hideous winged demon creature follows their path. The original The Unnamable was perhaps a dumb and unmemorable film at least it was entertaining. Part two is quite boring pretentious and outstays its welcome with a running time of nearly 105 minutes. The script is full of incomprehensible gibberish about quantum physics and I sincerely doubt that any of the actors understood the lines they were speaking. The gore is minimal but it nevertheless is an unpleasant movie to look at because far too many innocent people die. Innocent bystanders supportive characters that have done absolutely nothing to deserve to die and people that only wanted to help are being demolished by the creature's claws whilst the dimwitted main characters get away with everything. That's just not right not even if you exclusively watch horror films to see gore.".

In this feature Skolimowski exploits a favourite gambit unresolved blending of fantasy with reality while also fashioning a strongly political theme to demonstrate how an encounter with vendibility can convert idealism into hypocrisy and dispassion.

He is relying upon a benefit show that he will be staging in a West End theatre to create a large base of support for a dissident Polish subculture opposed to a repressive Warsaw regime that has become reliant upon imposition of martial law but his increasing need for funding generates strain between Alex and his family in particular with his oldest son Adam played by Michael Lyndon.  Respective cultural and identity crises plaguing Alex and Adam have become correlative since the younger Rodak resents his father's dependence upon capital in order to stage what is planned as an abstract drama because Adam believes that Poland would welcome more a diaspora of patriots.  Sadly the time in which this review may be read is about equal to the amount of comprehensible narrative offered in this production due to an extraordinary engulfment of meaning by Skolimowski who tenders a perpetual gathering of imagery certainly never dull in itself but having an exhaustive effect upon a viewer by reason of an unduly complex structure whereby it becomes virtually impossible to fathom precisely what might be occurring.  No character as presented displays virtue with but Jane Asher's role with her single scene seeming to be clearly defined probably as a result of its linear nature firstclass work with the camera by Mike Fash in addition to creative editing and sound design by Barrie Vince are insufficient to offset a nearly complete reliance upon form over substance.".

	schema:headline " BAND OF ASSASSINS  Powerful historical drama with flawless Mifune";
	schema:reviewBody "SHINSENGUMI aka BAND OF ASSASSINS 1970 is a largescale Japanese samurai drama based on actual events and historical figures. It tells the tale of what is essentially a paramilitary group of citizens who become swordsmen in the service of the Shogun in his conflict with the Emperor during the final years 18631868 of the Tokugawa Shogunate. This conflict precipitated by the opening of Japan to the west paralleled America's own Civil War which happened roughly around the same time 186165. The result in Japan was the onset of the Meiji Restoration which led to Japan restoring the Emperor to power adapting to new knowledge from the west and emerging as an industrial and world power in its own right.Toshiro Mifune stars as Isami Kondo the noble and idealistic farmerturnedswordsman who becomes chief of the Shinsengumi as the group is known after killing Serizawa Kamo played by Rentaro Mikuni the first chief a samurai who had become corrupt and arrogant. The film follows key events and battles in the course of the period covered 186369 and the shifts in the political winds as the Emperor soon aligns himself with prowestern forces the Shogun withdraws from the struggle and the Shinsengumi find themselves declared outlaws and rebels despite the fact that the group had originally formed to combat rebels opposing the Shogun. All of this is seen through the eyes of Kondo an honest but hardened man who has imposed on his men a strict set of samurai rules which require the act of seppuku ritual suicide by any of them if they break a rule. As he tries desperately to hold onto his obsolete code his world comes crashing down around him and he and his men and Japan pay a huge price. At some point it all must seem supremely futile to him yet he trudges on following his destiny to the sad bitter end. The movie doesn't seem to take sides but simply presents scenes from the rise and fall of the Shinsengumi. Their values seem horribly outmoded even at the time the events are taking place and they seem to cause an awful lot of pointless death and destruction. Kondo is neither romanticized nor glamorized although Mifune's portrayal certainly ennobles him as a sincere loyal man who was simply swept up and engulfed in the tide of overwhelming historical and social forces that had been building up throughout the feudal era. Japanese viewers don't need a guide to the background story since this is a piece of history that is rigorously taught in their classes. NonJapanese viewers however may need to study a little before watching this film and I don't mean watching THE LAST SAMURAI first since it's never clear from the film what the differences are between the Shogun and the Emperor or why they're at war. Who's fighting who and why are questions not adequately answered for viewers not already familiar with the history behind the movie so I would urge some research into the period first. There were a lot more issues at play than the question of Japan's impending modernization.This is one of the most important Japanese samurai films although I would hesitate to group it with such other classic samurai films as SEVEN SAMURAI YOJIMBO the SAMURAI trilogy SWORD OF DOOM and SAMURAI REBELLION to name a few. There is no adventure here no excitement or romance. The swordplay is not intricately choreographed. It is awkward messy and grueling exactly the way it would be if undertaken by farmersturnedinexperienced swordsmen. The only one who wields unmistakable skill in battle is Kondo who is established as a farmer with years of sword practice and training of others. One of the new recruits is an accountant from an affluent family whose fate is particularly heartwrenching and provides the turning point of the film. It's all masterfully photographed and staged complete with a somber music score by veteran composer Masaru Sato. This is a film that should be seen by all those interested in Japanese cinema and Japanese history. I would particularly like to single this film out for fans of the Japanese animated TV series Rurouni Kenshin and its madeforvideo prequels marketed in the U.S. as Samurai X all of which touch on in some way or other the turbulent period covered by this movie. I should also point out that a liveaction TV series entitled Shinsengumi on the same subject premiered on Japanese TV in 2004.".

The result in Japan was the onset of the Meiji Restoration which led to Japan restoring the Emperor to power adapting to new knowledge from the west and emerging as an industrial and world power in its own right.Toshiro Mifune stars as Isami Kondo the noble and idealistic farmerturnedswordsman who becomes chief of the Shinsengumi as the group is known after killing Serizawa Kamo played by Rentaro Mikuni the first chief a samurai who had become corrupt and arrogant. The film follows key events and battles in the course of the period covered 186369 and the shifts in the political winds as the Emperor soon aligns himself with prowestern forces the Shogun withdraws from the struggle and the Shinsengumi find themselves declared outlaws and rebels despite the fact that the group had originally formed to combat rebels opposing the Shogun. All of this is seen through the eyes of Kondo an honest but hardened man who has imposed on his men a strict set of samurai rules which require the act of seppuku ritual suicide by any of them if they break a rule. As he tries desperately to hold onto his obsolete code his world comes crashing down around him and he and his men and Japan pay a huge price. At some point it all must seem supremely futile to him yet he trudges on following his destiny to the sad bitter end. The movie doesn't seem to take sides but simply presents scenes from the rise and fall of the Shinsengumi. Their values seem horribly outmoded even at the time the events are taking place and they seem to cause an awful lot of pointless death and destruction. Kondo is neither romanticized nor glamorized although Mifune's portrayal certainly ennobles him as a sincere loyal man who was simply swept up and engulfed in the tide of overwhelming historical and social forces that had been building up throughout the feudal era. Japanese viewers don't need a guide to the background story since this is a piece of history that is rigorously taught in their classes. NonJapanese viewers however may need to study a little before watching this film and I don't mean watching THE LAST SAMURAI first since it's never clear from the film what the differences are between the Shogun and the Emperor or why they're at war. Who's fighting who and why are questions not adequately answered for viewers not already familiar with the history behind the movie so I would urge some research into the period first. There were a lot more issues at play than the question of Japan's impending modernization.This is one of the most important Japanese samurai films although I would hesitate to group it with such other classic samurai films as SEVEN SAMURAI YOJIMBO the SAMURAI trilogy SWORD OF DOOM and SAMURAI REBELLION to name a few. There is no adventure here no excitement or romance. The swordplay is not intricately choreographed. It is awkward messy and grueling exactly the way it would be if undertaken by farmersturnedinexperienced swordsmen. The only one who wields unmistakable skill in battle is Kondo who is established as a farmer with years of sword practice and training of others. One of the new recruits is an accountant from an affluent family whose fate is particularly heartwrenching and provides the turning point of the film. It's all masterfully photographed and staged complete with a somber music score by veteran composer Masaru Sato. This is a film that should be seen by all those interested in Japanese cinema and Japanese history. I would particularly like to single this film out for fans of the Japanese animated TV series Rurouni Kenshin and its madeforvideo prequels marketed in the U.S. as Samurai X all of which touch on in some way or other the turbulent period covered by this movie. I should also point out that a liveaction TV series entitled Shinsengumi on the same subject premiered on Japanese TV in 2004.";

The Shogunate of the Tokugawa was fighting the murderous ideology of sonn ji Revere the Emperor Expel the Barbarians whose followers had began to commit acts of murder in Kyoto. In response to this the Shogan formed the Rshigumi a group of 234 Ronin who were to protect the Shogan from harm.One of the leaders of this group was a man named Kondo Isami Mifune a man who would eventually dissent and go on to form the Shinsengumi. The former group the Rshigumi became suspicious of the Shinsengumi and sent spies to infiltrate the organization. Henceforth the Shinsengumi not only had to deal with the task of protecting the Shogun but also with treachery within their own group. This is the setting of Shinsengumi Assassins of Honor a carefully researched and violent historical piece set in 19th century Japan.Shinsengumi is an incredibly complex film. I must caution viewers that they might want to read up on the history of the time period before watching this film if you choose not to you might have problems following the plot. That being said as complex as it is Shinsengumi is just as good and rewarding.To be honest I knew from the first shot of this film that it was going to be great. The opening shot is of a westerner being slain by a samurai a torrential downpour of blood spraying into the camera. I have to say the first shot set my expectations high and I wasn't disappointed. After the bloody opener the film slows down and sets up the highly intricate plot and then introduces the viewer to Isami expertly played by Toshiro Mifune...as always.Isami is a former farmer and a ronin who helps form the Shensengumi. After the current leader goes crazy from alcoholism Isami slays him and becomes the head of the Shinsengumi. Once in power Isami's finds out his troubles are just beginning.Personally I don't think I've ever seen a bad performance by the late Toshiro Mifune and Shinsengumi is another testament to his great acting ability. As far as acting goes Shinsengumi features a great acting ensemble from Mifune down to Katsuo Nakamura's tragic portrayal of the clan's accountant.The only thing more exquisite than the acting is the wonderful detail poured into the set and wardrobe. Vivid colorful kimonos haori's and hakam's abound contrasted with beautifully reconstructed 19th century Kyoto add Kazuo Yamada's expert cinematography and Hiroshi Ueda's capable art direction and you have a historical epic.To be clear Shinsengumi is not an action film. Although it contains it's share of action the scene in the Ikeda mercantile factory is incredible!!!it's primary focus is on character development and an objective look at the political and social problems of late 19th century Japan.Bottom LineDirector Tadashi Sawashima delivers a violent samurai masterpiece with great acting score cinematography and a flawless Mifune.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm bursting with good things to say about this film. Japan's maybe the world's greatest actor playing one of Japan's greatest heroes is already goosebump inducing. In fact all of the cast is stellar. As the other comments have pointed out if you don't know the story of the Shinsengumi you're at a disadvantage. This is a sort of Japanese Iliad a real life story of heroism and tragedy. Everybody in Japan knows the names of the leaders of the Shinsengumi in the way that American children learn about George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. The good news is that the DVD program notes are fairly encyclopedic. They cover the major characters places and events. Serizawa's entry mentions that his hobbies include drawing long fights on the beach and driving foreign invaders from his homeland. The film starts out well by including the ugliness of the Wolves of Mibu period. Hijikata is portrayed in a very dark way. Toward the end Kondo actually says that Hijikata did all the dirty work so that Kondo could keep his hands and soul clean. Even though the Shinsengumi are the heroes there is a point where you will be yelling at Hijikata to commit seppuku. The shogunate is a mess and you end up rooting for Kondo's devotion to the shogunal party at the same time that you want the shogunate to dry up and blow away. The film manages to be nuanced and yet get you jumping up and down yelling at your television.The production is beautiful everything that you would want a samurai film to be. The costumes of the Shinsengumi are semiaccurate unlike the beautiful but wrong ones in Gohatto. Although the pattern is correct in this film the real colors were much more lurid. In real life they must have looked like a troop of murderous peacocks as they charged through Kyoto. The exterior shots are gorgeous and the interior shots are lovely as well although everybody seems to have brand new tatami at every point throughout the movie.".

Kondo himself had been adopted into a samurai family and was headmaster of the Shieikan Dojo which taught Tennen Rishin style swordsmanship and several of his high ranking students and instructors had joined him in the Roshigumi and Shinsengumi.

When multiple people are talking the text appears in various colors so it's easy to know who's saying what. But I was especially impressed that while they do a very very good job translating like some anime there are little explanatory notes at the top of the screen that appear to explain what is happening. That way Westerners who watch this understand the context for what is occurringat least to a point. I the quality captioning but still think that some particularly those not acquainted with Japanese history and films will be a bit confused from time to time especially which side is which. I know I wasand I am pretty knowledgeable about the history and have seen quite a few other films about this important time period in Japanese history. So if you see the film try reading through the program notes in the special featuresit helps explain things quite a bit.This film is set during the Meiji period in Japan. During the 1860s Japan was changing rapidly as a result of the opening of Japan thanks to Admiral Perry's visit in the 1850s. Perry forced the country to open up to foreignerssomething that had been banned for about 200 years. But many in Japan longed for the old ways and a serious struggle ensuedlike a civil war. The forces of change supported elevating the true power of the emperor who had only held ceremonial power for hundreds of years. The traditionalists favored keeping the old waysthe expulsion of all foreigners and supported a strong Shogun sort of like a boss who assumed power through diplomacy skills and force. In the midst of these struggles Japanese society was torn apart and chaos ruled the land. This is the background for the filmsomething the film assumed the audience knewand if they were Japanese this is probably true. But since this is an export film this background is necessary and was never included in SHINSENGUMI.Into this chaos came the Shinsengumia group made up of masterless samurai ronin who wanted to restore order in the land. They were traditionalists in many ways hating foreigners and supporting the Shogun but they also supported the Emperormaking them sort of like an independent force to ensure the peace. But to do so they needed to remain pure in spirit and deed as well as obey orders without question. This complete obedience is a theme throughout the film and several times their oath is put to the test as followers were expected to kill themselves by committing ritual seppuku if they broke their oath.The leader at least initially of the group was a man who had a drinking problem and brought reproach on the group. And since he would not kill himself since he was a selfish jerk the group took action on their own. The film never made this clear who killed the leader but I did some reading and found out that Kond Isami Mifune's character ordered this killing in order to purify the group from such corruption. Now the leadership mantle was passed to Isami characterwho was pretty much the type guy you'd expect him to be since he had a long track record in starring in Samurai epics. He's tough obedient and selfsacrificinglike he expected the rest of the Shinsengumi to be.The film is unusual because it varies so much in mood and pace. Much of the time the film is rather calm and talkative but then at others it quickly becomes brutal and violent the code of the shinsengumi required thiswith some amazingly bloody scenes for 1969. Be prepared to see geysers of blood severed limbs and the likewhich makes since as they're fighting with swords! In addition it's unusual in its fatalismmaking the film a bit of a downer to watch. If you are looking for a happily ever after film you can't get any more unlike it with this film!! I liked the film though did find it a bit long and in need of even more explanatory notes! Or perhaps I should brush up on my Meiji history a bit morewhich is what some viewers might want to do before seeing the film.By the way when I looked up this exceptional DVD on Amazon it was only 5.99an awfully good price when you consider the quality of the packaging that goes along with the movie.".
