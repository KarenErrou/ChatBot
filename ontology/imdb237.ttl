Ludvik Jahn served in a noncombatant military unit then spent a year in a prison without conviction and had to work for six years in the mines for lack of university degree just because his colleagues and Party comrades took very seriously a stupid joke he wrote to his beloved for absolutely personal reasons. Jahn's revenge had to take the form of a joke because his major concern was namely that how could these men take so seriously an innocent charade? Yet his joke turned out bad instead of humiliating Pavel the once leader of the students' party organization by seducing his wife Jahn humiliated the innocent and naive woman broke the heart of her young suitor and most unfortunately had to realize that Pavel the allegedly serious communist fared much better in the field of adultery enjoying the company of 20year old attractive students who have absolutely no notion of Marxism and the construction of socialism. It is through this realization and not so much through his earlier ostracization that Ludvik is confronted with the consequences of his own misplaced joke. His lonely protest against the system failed.ADDED IN 2009 now that Kundera was revealed to have himself denounced a capitalist spy to the police authorities and thus contributed to the longterm prisoncorrection camp sentences of several people this bookmovie develops in an unexpected dimension. Was it a deliberate or subconscious way for Kundera to deal with his own guilt a way to explain to his younger self that what he did apparently out of good faith and sense of civic duty at the age of 20 seemed nothing but utter stupidity at the age of forty?".

Nevertheless viewed as an independent art piece shorn of its erstwhile political context it still can hold courts in terms of Jires' nifty visual and editing modality but at the same time is severely undermined by several unsavory blemishes not least its blinkered misogynous treatment. In 1968 a middleaged scientist Ludvik Jahn Somr returns to Prague after almost two decades and gestates a vengeance to his former college schoolmates who have expelled him from both the college and party due to a facetious Long Live Trotsky postcard he sends to his sweetheart Marie Obermaierov to cheer her up. The joke recoils badly and Ludvik is sent to reeducation in the military where sadistic corporeal punishment is subject to those political dissenters. In the face of the film's 20yearapart pastandpresent correlation Jires adopts an impetuous cross cutting technique to juxtapose those two timeframes together often predicating upon the incidents in the present time a celebration of newborn babies a music rehearsal of his old bandmates etc. which evoke Ludvik's memory of tonally diametrical situations and subjective angle is also craftily applied to give the audience a vantage point of a haphazardish narrative. So Ludvik's halfbaked plan is to seduce Helena Dtetov Why don't you grow a pair? the wife of Pavel Munzar who is his former friend and treacherously betrays him in the trial of his joke. His plan works to our utter incredulity because Somr's Ludvik is the antithesis of his dashing counterpart in Kundera's source novel a bald portly reticent type inept in his action and disaffected in his cynical gaze so the reason why Helena falls for him so hard is a total myth and very much contrived loneliness maybe but as a successful TV anchorwoman she is not shy of suitors even younger prettier ones. It is a plain pathetic male wishfulfillment in establishing Helena as a desperate erotomaniac albeit Dtetov's willed attempts to extract some compassion out of her poorly devised character arc and overall the female characters are either a masochistic cougar a priggish party devotee or a candyfloss trophy girlfriend no wonder Ludvik frankly admits that he prefers whores.To shame a man by sleeping with his wife the stratagem itself is petty malicious and misogynous to a fault if Jires' intention is to make Ludvik a miserable reprobate he has it on a silver platter. A trenchant reproof of an inequitable polity or a pessimistic take on an individual's ingrown corruption? THE JOKE begins as the former but ends up in close proximity of the latter that is a letdown with a capital L.".

For this Ludvik was expelled from college and the communist party and had to serve in a military punishment battalion and a couple years of hard labor. Before this point all the flashbacks are from Jahn's point of view after we get to see our protagonist with more hair as he is pointlessly drilled by sadistic sergents and digs out granite in a quarry. His revenge is simple cuckold Peter by starting an affair with Helena then dump her. However things do not go as planned... Without the political undertones Zert would be a typical example of the manage a troi picture Europe was cranking out during the sexual revolution.

This is not a review as such other than to say that Sundays and Cybele is without doubt the most exquisite heartbreaking sublime delicate moving and transcendental movie ever created. The purpose of this 'post' is to let you all know that way downunder here in Melbourne Australia I am the fortunate owner of a 16mm cinemascope print of this absolute masterpiece. My email address is displayed above. You are welcome to email me personally. If there is ever a possibility that you could get to beautiful Melbourne I would be proud and delighted to screen the film for you. I myself have resisted the temptation to acquire the film on video...that would seem only to trivialize it by reducing it to the same size  therefore stature as television programs. It is a film to be enjoyed on the big screen and I am doubly fortunate because there is a small cinema here in Melbourne seating about 50 which I hire out on those occasions when I can't wait another day to see the film. At the present rate I screen it about 4 or 5 times a year sometimes just with myself and 1 other sometimes with an invited audience of 15 or 20. If at any time any of you readers of this communication would like to take the trouble to journey to Melbourne Australia I would gladly run the movie for you at no cost to you. When I meet you I will also proudly show you Hardy Kruger's autograph to me written on an original A4 size poster for the film which as a reckless teenager I stole from its display case on the final day of its big screen season here in Melbourne in 1964. 14 years later in 1978 I was lucky enough to meet Hardy when he came to Australia to promote a film he made here Storm Boy. And guess what he said to me when I unrolled the poster and asked if he would sign it? Ah my favorite film!!. I am like many of you...I have been haunted inspired intoxicated transported in ecstasy plunged into the deepest of despair by that extraordinary film ever since. It is an unforgettable encounter with great beauty. Let me know if you can come here to see it. We'll have a wonderful evening. Peter Byrne Australia.".

Alas had Serge Bourgoinon gone on to make more films of equal quality it would be remembered alongside Jules and Jim instead of being just a footnote. The earlier poster who noted that it is precisely because he and Patricia Gozzi were meteors who cooled quickly that this film is forgotten was absolutely right.Another point is the haunting Maurice Jarre We're Home theme. So much of his later soundtrack music was bombastic that is astonishing to find a simple poignant melody used here to evoke the tenderness beauty and vulnerability of the world that these two are able to create in the park.".

Alas had Serge Bourgoinon gone on to make more films of equal quality it would be remembered alongside Jules and Jim instead of being just a footnote. The earlier poster who noted that it is precisely because he and Patricia Gozzi were meteors who cooled quickly that this film is forgotten was absolutely right.Another point is the haunting Maurice Jarre We're Home theme. So much of his later soundtrack music was bombastic that is astonishing to find a simple poignant melody used here to evoke the tenderness beauty and vulnerability of the world that these two are able to create in the park.";

It must've been the era or the black and white photography or just the way the actors and the setting were filmed but it's one of those pictures that you can't describe you must experience to get the joys from it. Although I don't get affected by what most people call art this film to me represents the highest form of art and it affected me greatly as a human being.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's taken me a long time to catch up with this outstanding film but it was well worth the wait and I am further indebted  if that is possible  to my good friend in France for making this available to me. The theme of two wounded birds attempting to heal each other is far from new the theme of adult and child bonding whether sexual or otherwise is if anything even older so this movie had a lot to beat and to say it does so hands down is to underrate it. The phrase 'adult and child' evokes anything from Lolita to Le Papillon and everything in between but nothing comes even close to this uniquely beautiful film that is reminiscent in its complex simplicity of Au Hasard Balthazar and equally unforgettable. The two leads are absolutely SUPERB  and Hardy Kruger is the last person I thought I'd ever say that about  and completely dominate the support fine though it is. One of its strengths is the way in which Writing Directing and Acting surmount easily the main stumbling blocks of coincidence and outrageous fortune consider what are the chances that one wounded bird Kruger would encounter another Pozzi at Exactly the right time for both their psyches to respond to the healing elixir in the other or for that matter that a father would more or less cheerfully abandon a daughter without either a second thought or a plausible reason and that a second man bearing no resemblance to the biological father would not face even the most basic interrogation when turning up claiming to be the father and be allowed to remove her from the care of the nuns Sunday after Sunday. Perhaps paedophilia was just a word in 1964 but whatever the Artists involved in this film as I have already stated make us completely forget practicalitiesrealism and draw us inexorably into THEIR world where the tragic end is equally inexorable. I cannot speak too highly of this magnificent film which I will watch again and again.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film's subject was risqu fifty years ago and it remains so even now. How can one make us believe in the delicate charm of this wondrous love story between Pierre Hardy Krger a shellshocked amnesiac thirtysomething man and a lonely twelveyearold child Cyble Patricia Gozzi without promoting or raising the specter of pedophilia? It is the intense love story of incredible purity a love that the cynical adult world cannot understand and will eventually condemn. Reading this film's synopsis one immediately thinks of Lolita except for the fact that in Sundays and Cybele the adult man is not the sexually obsessed Humbert Humbert and the young girl is not the treacherous nymphet Dolores Haze. Under Director Serge Bourguignon Sundays and Cybele becomes an authentic masterpiece deeply moving a film touched by grace and poetry which is made even more miraculous by its controversial subject.The relatively small cast is brilliant starting with Patricia Gozzi's extraordinary portrayal of Cyble as an extremely feminine intelligent and enchanting little girl. She plays this character with astounding insight evoking the apparent understanding of a mature woman. Her attachment to Pierre is a mixture of her budding sexual stirrings and of the impulses to reach for the male affection she has never known in a loveless broken home. Gozzi is without a doubt the finest child actress I have ever seen. Hardy Krger fulfils his difficult role of Pierre with panache as a misfit on the margins of society. He portrays a man whose life has been shattered and who is desperately trying to find a way out of his amnesia and vertigo to start anew and in the process of his healing Pierre becomes as much of a father to Cyble as he is her big brother her boyfriend and even her son.Nicole Courcel as Madeleine acting underscores her welldeserved reputation in the role of a loving and understanding mistress who has brought Pierre to physical health and is patiently trying to restore his mental health through her unconditional love. Daniel Ivernel as Carlos is also excellent in his role as Pierre's best and only friend and confident a man who has tried to understand and accepted his friend's relationship with the young girl.Sunday and Cybele is based on the eponymous novel by Bernard Echassriaux. This was Serge Bourguignon's feature film debut and what a debut! and it became his magnum opus. Besides the grace of the cinematic conceit and the dialogue Bourguignon's miseenscene is praiseworthy from beginning to end instead of physically and literally recreating an imaginary world he suggests its reality through its magic. For example there is a traveling framing of Pierre's and Cyble's reflections in the water rather than on them directly as well as the many contemplative shots of nature during which the dialogue is superimposed. The camera behaves as another character a silent witness intimidated by their love who does not dare to look them directly in the eyes lest their innocence be corrupted. With these simple effects Bourguignon renders the beauty and purity of their union  and also its fragility. The film puts great emphasis on intimate silent scenes such as the walks along the pounds and in the forest in the cold and the mist of the winter Sundays. Although this film was made during the birth of the Nouvelle Vague Bourguignon's film is closer to the poetic realism of Carn Renoir and in particular the tone in Ren Clment's Forbidden Games 1952. The setting is Ville d'Avray a small community near Paris which at the time of the filming had still retained its rustic setting its forest with its hunting roads and famous pounds which so inspired the painter Jean Batiste Corot. The sublime photography in black and white is by Henri Deca who has 84 films on his rsum including such memorable films as Louis Malle's The Lovers 1958 and Franois Truffaut's The 400 Blows 1959. Maurice Jarre's discreet and beautiful musical score together with a very appropriate old French song Aux marches du palais and other musical excerpts ranging from Tibetan music to works by classical composers including Thomaso Albinoni and MarcAntoine Charpentier and exquisite natural sounds creates an otherworldly timeless atmosphere.As mentioned above the film's subject the relationship between an adult man and a young girl might be extremely controversial. Although no sexual relation is ever suggested between Pierre and Cyble their relationship being primarily emotional in nature in Greek mythology the goddess Earth Mother Cybele had a eunuch mendicant priesthood. Nevertheless many viewers and critics were none the less shocked and outraged. Times have not much changed at a recent screening of the film at a cinclub a few years ago many viewers were appalled that such a eulogy to pedophilia could be shown. The strength of Bourguignon's film is the subtlety and sensitivity with which the subject is handled. He never looks for the shocking or the melodramatic or poses himself as a moralist. He is simply an emotional witness to the story where a child who has grown perhaps too fast and an adult who has reverted to childhood meet and emerge from their individual loneliness. Bourguignon distances himself from the melodramatic by adopting an outsider's point of view his genius has been to put the viewer in the position of Madeleine and Carlos rather than that of Pierre and Cyble. Choosing the latter for the viewpoint would certainly have been detrimental to the film manipulating the viewer's emotions to the extreme. Following Bourguignon's suggestion we should become a Madeleine or a Carlos merely observing and through our observations try to understand".

I can add no other useful information except although this film had dated slightly well after all it is over 45 years old! it's more than watchable it's unmissable and unforgettable! Hardy Kruger's acting is perfect spot on as a dysfunctional adult and Patricia Gozzi's acting will take your breath away. Why she did so little after this film I only saw her again in RAPTURE 1965 is a mystery to all who witnessed her acting abilities.

	schema:headline " The essence of unfair competition";
	schema:reviewBody "is what many an adult woman might call the result when a man she loves develops a romantic entanglement with what we call a child in any case as in this one a little girl.  Generally presumed to be sexual on its face such a relationship seldom involves actual sex but always an emotional intensity which is often even commonly lacking from the carnal attractions of a man and woman.

Unsurprisingly the accolades which accompanied SUNDAYS AND CYBELE opened for its undeniably talented director Serge Bourguignon the doors of Hollywood but perhaps just as predictably his work there never amounted to much and sadly 7 years and 3 films later he dropped completely out of sight and mind.

Over the film's opening credits Kruger is shown mowing down a child during an air raid  a traumatic event which left him so guiltridden that the vile abandonment of the little girl by her father at a railway station is unbearable to himto the extent that he impulsively takes to impersonating him every Sunday picking her up at her convent school and going on afternoon outings in the woods. Meanwhile Kruger is being cared for and lives with his nurse Nicole Courcel and has bonded with a friendly sculptor Daniel Ivernel who while appreciating the soothing effect the meetings with Gozzi are having on Kruger also fear that his violent mood swings may eventually endanger the girl. Events come to a head during an enforced wedding party and the subsequent visit to a fairground and especially the fatal intervention of the nurse's jealous colleague who brings in the Police when Kruger goes missing on Christmas Eve. As I intimated earlier the potential sentimentality of the story is kept admirably at bay by the ultrastylish handling and excellent performances all round conversely the main flaws of the film are a rather deliberate pace and a slightly misjudged ending while I found the choice to have Kruger's demise occur offscreen effective I think it would have been even more so had Kruger fallen to his death while trying to steal the allimportant to Gozzi weathercock off the church steeple rather than being shot dead by the Police for approaching Gozzi with a knife clasped in his hand! The print I saw was a serviceable but very battered one extremely soft with a virtually inexistent blackscale and the hardcoded white subtitles occasionally unreadable when appearing against the snowy landscape  which again points to the unfortunate neglect this film has been subjected to over the years.".

	schema:reviewBody "After killing a child on a routine bombing mission in Vietnam Pierre Hardy Kruger suffers from delayed stress and partial amnesia. Returning to France he lives like a vegetable until he meets a young girl Patricia Gozzi who has been dumped by her father at a boarding school.What makes this film notable in retrospect is its story of Vietnam and the torment it caused a man. Although countless American films have done this most were late on the scene and almost all focus on the American experience. Myopic Americans may have forgotten the French had a much greater part to play in the region and their story is rarely told.Oddly the controversy that resulted from this film had nothing to do with its theme of Vietnam but rather with the theme of pedophilia which never even explicitly comes up. Despite the clear relationship of an innocent surrogate father Pierre has been painted by some as a predator. Why? Perhaps because of the novel's take on him which is markedly different. Coincidentally Kubrick's Lolita was released this same year 1962 if viewers wanted to compare film about adult relationships to children they did not have far to go in order to find grossly disparate stories.Regarding the cast Patricia Gozzi is a charming young actress perhaps better known for her role in Rapture 1965. For some reason she stopped acting following Hung Up 1973 when she was only 22. Kruger has had a much longer career and is thought of as one of the greatest German actors of the 1960s and is arguably the first German actor to have been accepted as a protagonist by audiences outside Germany post World War II.Director Serge Bourguignon is a great unknown with any attempt to learn about him leading back to this film. We know prior to this he had studied painting and sculpture and made some short documentaries including the Cannes favorite Le soirire in 1960. He gave up directing in 1969 following some American flops which have since gained small cult followings although he lived for a great many more decades as of November 2014 he is still alive. What has he been up to? The film's success took an unusual path. Initially turned down in France for distribution the movie was a huge critical success in America being hailed as a masterpiece by the New York Times and winning the foreign language Oscar. Then French theaters could not wait to screen it. The second time in France was mixed as critics had become obsessed with the New Wave and Bourguignon had a very different sensibility than his peers.This is a film well worth discovering or rediscovering by all especially the young at heart.".

Myopic Americans may have forgotten the French had a much greater part to play in the region and their story is rarely told.Oddly the controversy that resulted from this film had nothing to do with its theme of Vietnam but rather with the theme of pedophilia which never even explicitly comes up. Despite the clear relationship of an innocent surrogate father Pierre has been painted by some as a predator. Why? Perhaps because of the novel's take on him which is markedly different. Coincidentally Kubrick's Lolita was released this same year 1962 if viewers wanted to compare film about adult relationships to children they did not have far to go in order to find grossly disparate stories.Regarding the cast Patricia Gozzi is a charming young actress perhaps better known for her role in Rapture 1965. For some reason she stopped acting following Hung Up 1973 when she was only 22. Kruger has had a much longer career and is thought of as one of the greatest German actors of the 1960s and is arguably the first German actor to have been accepted as a protagonist by audiences outside Germany post World War II.Director Serge Bourguignon is a great unknown with any attempt to learn about him leading back to this film. We know prior to this he had studied painting and sculpture and made some short documentaries including the Cannes favorite Le soirire in 1960. He gave up directing in 1969 following some American flops which have since gained small cult followings although he lived for a great many more decades as of November 2014 he is still alive. What has he been up to? The film's success took an unusual path. Initially turned down in France for distribution the movie was a huge critical success in America being hailed as a masterpiece by the New York Times and winning the foreign language Oscar. Then French theaters could not wait to screen it. The second time in France was mixed as critics had become obsessed with the New Wave and Bourguignon had a very different sensibility than his peers.This is a film well worth discovering or rediscovering by all especially the young at heart.";

	schema:reviewBody "Sundays and Cybele is a film that would be very very difficult to make today. Even back in the early 1960s folks were probably a bit uneasy about the plot...especially since it did seeem to POSSIBLY hint at pedophilia. Today with a greater awareness of these issues I really think it couldn't be made today...at least without some major revisions.Hardy Kruger plays Pierre a pilot with a bad case of PostTraumatic Stress Disorder. He has huge gaps in his memory is occasionally explosive and is quite sullen. However when he meets a sad girl being taken to an orphanage his life completely changes. Through some odd coincidences the orphanage thinks HE is the child's father and since he feels sorry for her he begins seeing her on visiting days hence the Sunday in the title. However much of their time together is spend not as father and child but almost like lovers...and the child talks out loud about marrying Pierre when she is older.Oddly Pierre does not tell his girlfriend about this situation and when she finds out she is not enraged or worried that he might be a pedophile. She observes the pair covertly during one of his visits and thinks they are good for each other. However all this comes to a tragic ending at Christmas when Pierre's behaviors get a bit goofy even for him and the police get involved.This is a very well made but slow film. The cinematography is often quite interestingparticularly with its use of keyholestyle shots. As for the story...as I mentioned it is very slow and often made me feel uncomfortable. I think it was worse for me because I used to be a therapist who worked with sexual abuse victims and the strange relationship between the pair seemed pretty consistent with some pedophiles and the way they groom their victims. Still if you can somehow ignore this and that would be tough the story has some interesting aspects. Not a bad film at all...but a rather disturbing one.By the way I have no idea why Hardy Kruger a German actor was chosen to play Pierre...a Frenchman. It did seem odd.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the opening credits you get your first clue that this spaghetti western is going to be much different that what you typically get. The Mario Migliardi score is subdued sounding quieter and playing at a much slower pace than in your typical spaghetti western. It continues this way for the rest of the movie with the occasional addition of odd nonmusical sounds.As it turns out this score fits this particular western very well. The focus isn't on action but more on the various conflicts between the characters. The first half of the movie almost exclusively takes place in a coach stop building and its adjacent barn where most of the players first meet up and start all the conflicts. This half of the movie actually comes close to being a kind of thriller with various characters getting the upper hand at various moments people with secrets and an underlying feeling of tension.All these goingons played out with the odd score actually make the movie kind of creepy and this feeling continues in the second half when the characters hit the trail and cross the desolate landscape. Director Giuseppe Vari keeps a feeling of mystery and uncertainty right to the end adding some unusual camera angles to highlight this kind of disorientation. He also has a great assett with having the great Klaus Kinski as the chief villain. Though Kinski is dubbed and with a voice that sounds far from what he sounded like in real life he still proves a powerful villain with his creepy facial expressions and movements. Even when he simply stretches out he does it in a way that gives you the creeps! Highly recommended if you can find it.".

This Spaghetti movie gets the usual Western issues  such as greedy antiheroes  violent facing off  quick zooms  exaggerated baddies .

While waiting for the gold to arrive they meet a stranger  John Webb Paul SullivanPaolo Casella  who wants half the gold in exchange for guiding them safely to Mexico  but he is really seeking vengeance . John is a tough and rare gunslinger  he's an efficient Pistolero acting as judge  jury  and executioner . Reluctantly  Dan agrees under the condition that they give him fifty percent of the stolen gold they are transporting and they set across the brutal desert for a race to the border with the Rangers hot on their tail . Meanwhile  the nasty gang kidnaps the stagecoach passengers and the freelance gunman named John Webb is betrayed and deceived . John chases the nasty thieves and the ending settle disputes by shooting . It is an acceptable  passable Western with several titles Renegade Gun  Pray to Kill and Return Alive OR Prega il Morto  Ammazza il Vivo Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead To Kill a Jackal contains an interesting but twisted plot about a gang rob a bank and then they hire a mysterious man to guide them across the Mexican border in return for half of the loot . It packs violence  double crosses  shoot'em up and results to be quite entertaining  though drags at times  balancing in ups and downs . There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing some violence  crossfire or stunts every few minutes . It is an entertaining SW with lots of action  gunplay and fun . The main starring is Kinski who appears dressed in dark and with a killer look  gaining a reputation for his ferocious talent and equally ferocious temper . Here he plays with lots of gesticulation and excessive gestures . As he is fine  as he ravages the screen  hit and run and kills . It's a thrilling western with breathtaking confrontation between the protagonist Paul Sullivan against the heartless enemies formed by a brutal gang led by Klaus Kinski . This western is made during his Italian period when Klaus starred a lot of Westerns  later he collaborated with Werner Herzog with whom played several prestigious films . They later collaborated on five movies  Aguirre 1972 Woyzeck 1979 Nosferatu 1979 Fitzcarraldo 1982 and Cobra Verde 1987. As Kinski starred numerous Spaghetti such as Black Killer  If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death  Bullet King  Shangai Joe  Clint the solitary  The Ruthless Four  Nevada Kid  The return of Clint  and specially famous resulted to be his acting in For a fistful of dollars more . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as well as a lot of twists and turns  as the film approaches its climax  as in the final and the customary conclusion . Atmospheric Eastmancolor cinematography by Franco Villa in WideScreen  though being necessary a good remastering and filmed in Elios studios  as usual  and El Lacio .

	schema:reviewBody "Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead is an averageatbest spaghetti western that has its entertaining moments though it has many faults.The acting is very dry and somewhat wooden except for Klaus Kinski in the role of Dan Hogan the leader of an outlaw gang. Hogan is an overthetop ruthless character who is very entertaining to watch due to Kinski's mannerisms and acting style. Kinski is the only reason this movie merits a rating of 6 rather than a 4 or 5.The storyline isn't all that interesting. It starts off as one of those everyone's a badguy and we're all after the gold flicks then near the end of the movie we learn it is really a revenge story. The problem is a good revenge story needs buildup. We see nothing of how the protagonist was wronged nor do we see any anger or emotion of any kind from him. We only learn of his motivations when a Texas ranger matteroffactly tells them to someone. As a result we can't become all that drawn into the story and are only mildly interested in seeing the revenge played out.There is lots of sitting in a room and walking through the desert in this movie. It would have helped if there was more action.The music score is pretty decent and there is some good camera work especially during some of the closeups of the characters' faces.If you are an avid spaghetti western fan there is enough here to make this worth a watch mostly thanks to Kinski.".

A bit of a cynic he believes he is a selfmade man and that whatever he has achieved in life is due to his own hard work and nobody else's. His cynicism is extended to his views about marriage to his fianc Jenny Ayesha Takia and to the festival of Diwali too. Just as Sunny is cynical about life Michael Burnett Boman Irani is optimistic about it. 51 year old Michael is a simple minded man almost childlike and has recently landed job as a pizza delivery boy at Mummy's Pizza. Michael has sort of an inclination to lose every job he has ever had in 2 days flat. This time however he vows to keep this one no matter what. On the eve of Diwali Sunny has loads of stuff to do and very little time to do it...";

Boman Irani who worked in the home delivery pizza shop arrives at Viveks home to make his delivery...talks with Karan Johar on the phone of Vivek's behalf and gets the job done unexpectedly.The film mainly features on the fact that ONE SMALL MOMENT HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THE LIFE.overall the film is a very disappointing package.I would advise u to give free tickets of this film to all your enemies.Lets Hope That i will see a better film from Sujoy Ghosh in the future...............Cheers Anuj Puranik".

Many will never understand this movie and I feel very sorry for you that you do not. This is a classic that is underrated. I have seen it MANY times and can totally relate. Do not think you understand something when you do not because you have no place or business even thinking you do and giving it a false negative rating. I bought this digital video disc as soon as it was released. It was much better than most of the critically acclaimed movies and the music soundtrack was very good which helped the movie a lot. Kudos to the director who took the risk to tell it like it is. Thank you.".

Why was other top notch actors such as Samuel L. Jackson John C. McGinley and Famke Janssen used in the film? McGinley was uncredited and I don't know why? What was really the purpose of having Rosanna Arquette as the psychic? All four had such short roles in the film. Through out the beginning is all there was the big talk about the chew and didn't find out what the chew is until the middle. I really don't know what I watched. Jeff Goldblum performed very well. If you must watch this movie prepare for a hundred minute boring fest! If you are not sure about renting the film or not don't let the box fool you! Avoid it no matter what you do! Though if you want to see another Goldblum movie however watch the superior Mister Frost!".

	schema:reviewBody "In this 1992 film Jeff Goldblum and Rory Cochrane star as a father and son who despite having a somewhat strained relationship are bought together by a strange and dangerous ordeal. Directed by Paul Mones the film takes place in a Jersey beach town where most people seem to live normal ordinary lives. Right from the start Max and Ed are very intuitive. They're both in touch with their feelings and the world around them. But its the eerie presence of a mysterious shore killer with an uncanny appearance that causes them to feel on edge and drift into an imaginary world. As the killer encounters Max and Ed at different times they begin to have moments of ESP. The killer seems drawn to Max and Ed in a way that's creepy and unsettling. He appears out of nowhere and always manages to be in the same place at the same time. When Eddie is attacked in the end its Max's sudden intuition that saves his life.The dialogue between the characters is good. In addition the dialogue that was read from the book Cats  Dogs was very intriguing. The author of the book whose name is Isaac is someone not heard of by any of the characters although its possible that the author might be the killer himself. As several of the characters recite passages from the book it becomes clear that what they're reading is having a dynamic effect on them. The art of communicating without speaking and joining a universal community are themes from the book. Its great to see the characters particularly Ed develop a deeper understanding of what these ideas are about even though the intentions of the author are ominous and insincere.The relationship between Max and Ed is good to watch Both of them are connected in such a way that is deep and profound. Its wonderful how Max's sudden intuition bought them closer together in the end. Jeff Goldblum is great as the loving father trying to establish a closer bond with his son. Rory Cochrane gives a decent performance as the distant and somewhat rebellious teenage son.Through solid directing Paul Mones does a fantastic job in demonstrating the mental and emotional similarities between Max and Ed. In addition he not only shows how meaningful any relationship can be but he also shows how tragedy can bring a family closer together forcing them to love and appreciate each other a lot more.".

A Thanksgiving diner degenerates into a boisterous wild party complete with drinking dancing potsmoking and Louie Louie blasting on the soundtrack. A tavern holds New England clam chowder women's wrestling matches. A solemn funeral procession gets rudely disrupted by a stray cat. Dr. Joyce Brothers is branded a heretic at a witch trial when she diagnoses the puritans as paranoid homicidal sexually frustrated lunatics! My favorite gag has the delectable Barbara Carrera transforming into the spectacularly ugly and haggish Anne Ramsey whose remarkable resemblance to a squat gnarled unsightly garden gnome is ingeniously taken advantage of here. Okay so this ain't exactly a highly insightful and sophisticated work of refined cinematic art but it's definitely rowdy wacky amusing and above all irreverent enough to still earn this particular reviewer's seal of approval.".

The plan is going real well when suddenly a real witch Faith for witchcraft accuses the innocent Sara Lee. She uses this as a chance to get to her boyfriend Miles but he stands by Sara and tries his best to convince the town she's no witch.Love at Stake is a reasonably obscure and smallscale bgrade spoof that amusingly sends up the infamous Salem witch trails with quick fire gags and lowbrow tone. There's a certain Zucker and Abraham style think of Airplane  Top Secret! about this comedy. It even has a touch of Monty Python about it. The martial has a cheeky hit and miss selfmockery about itself but it's always on the move and there are some inspired lines of dialogue. The corny premise is quite an original take with plenty of zing and a playfully raunchy touch. There's plenty of room for minor jokes to feed off the major one. It can get infantile and crass but the superb cast upped the material to another level with their blinding chemistry and welltimed performances. Stuart Pankin and Dave Thomas were sensational as the two weasels Judge John and Mayor Upton. They clicked when they came together. Kelly Preston was delightfully sweet and very effective in her role as Sara and Patrick Cassidy fitted perfectly as her concerned boyfriend Miles. A fickle turn by Bud Cort had me snickering quite a bit as the blind Parson Babcock and an alluring Barbara Carrera turns heads as the voluptuous witch Faith. It's directed with a lot of ticker by Saturday Night Live's John Moffitt. Which it's a shame that it goes by unnoticed.A fun flick with energetic performances but in the long run it's still a forgettable spoof. Well worth a look though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wacky and wonderful comedy spoofing the Salem Witch Trials of the 17th century in the great Mel Brooks tradition. It really is a shame this movie isn't better known because it really is rather good. A great cast makes the most out of the material as two crooked officials a judge Stuart Pankin and mayor Dave Thomas scheme to get their hands on the property of their citizens by falsely accusing them of witchcraft and having them burnt at the stake. Caught up in the shenanigans are endearing young couple Miles Patrick Cassidy and Sara as in baker Sara Lee played by Kelly Preston. Meanwhile a genuine witch named Faith played by the smoking hot Barbara Carrera arrives in town and stirs up some trouble. This slice of history may strike some as an odd choice of material to lampoon but it does work as the stiflingly puritan attitudes of the townspeople contrast with the sleazy goings on. The obvious anachronisms are a hoot to behold and incidental jokes also help in the entertainment value as for one thing when the citizens have dinner with the local Indians and people get high on peace pipe smoke we hear music more appropriate for East Indian characters. In one very weird but inspired touch a deputy speaks doing a Don Knotts impression and the actor in the role does a good job. There is lots of energy both in the presentation and in the performances. The huffy Pankin and the horny Thomas are particularly funny and the enticing Carrera is very easy to watch. The long list of capable performers also includes Bud Cort Harold  Maude as the parson who goes blind singer Annie Golden as Abigail David Graf a.k.a. Tackleberry from the Police Academy franchise as her husband Nathaniel the incomparable Anne Ramsey as an old witch and none other than Dr. Joyce Brothers who takes the stand at Sara's trial in her defense and is branded a heretic when she utters psychological explanations that the townspeople don't want to hear. The trial also gets simply hysterical when that rap number breaks out. Now some of the humour is obvious like playing upon the word pussy but for the most part this is irresistible stuff with some decent slapstick gags and some priceless lines of dialogue. Fans of Brooks's films and the actors involved really should give it a look. Eight out of 10.".

Anyway this was one of those comedies that is pretty much hit or miss. Some parts were hilarious. Other parts not so much. Personally I liked the performance of Parson Babcock Bud Cort the best. Additionally having attractive actresses like Kelly Preston as Sara Lee and the aforementioned Barbara Carrera in the movie didn't hurt either.

	schema:reviewBody "While I am a Bollywood aficionado I do feel Hindu commercial cinema could stand to improve the quality of their output while still maintaining those fundamental elements that make Bollywood so much fun. Such an effort would help to widen the commercial appeal of these films to western audiences while still allowing them to be what they should be first and foremost that is a national product for Indian audiences. KISNA is prime example of a film that could have followed the example of the brilliant LAGAAN and broken borders but instead falls into the same might have been category as so many other Indian musicals. There is a lot to like about KISNA. The story is interesting and one that would appeal to audiences not particularly familiar with the Bollywood genre the characters are intriguing the songs are above average and best of all the movie is shot with an eye for the spectacular. But despite all of this the director fails at pulling it all together despite having all the elements for a real classic. Apparently the film was written produced and directed by a single person but I'm sure a little oversight and collaboration would have helped. I suspect this director was a bit full of himself as evidenced by the final image of the film being of himself sweeping his arm out over a vast valley where the movie was shot as if to say this film is all mine! KISNA is bound to be compared to LAGAAN and with good reason. Both films are concerned with the British Raj and both depict a love triangle between an Indian man and woman and the British woman who comes between them. Yet whereas LAGAAN had a light fairytale feel to it KISNA is all drama and action. This is not necessarily a problem except it's executed with a heavy hand from the start. The worst parts however are the repetitive action sequences which are basically the same situations played out over and over again. By the third time the young British woman is carried away by a bad guy you sort of hope she doesn't come back. As well some of the stunts are merely implied by camera work rather than actually shown which feels a bit like a cheat and takes some of the excitement away.Still if you want an excuse to see KISNA the musical numbers certainly fit the bill. The cinematographer and dance choreographer do an exquisite job fueling the numbers with vibrance and excitement and some of the sequences are simply stunningly beautiful. There is however one very unfortunate exception. During one number which really should have been a touching song of unexpressed feelings by one character for another quickly devolves into the most absurd display of tasteless pop pandering I've seen in a Bollywood film in quite sometime. Rather than a deserted church in 1947 India we are transported into something akin to a Mariah Carey music video replete with glowing motion trails and video generated rainbows. I half expected to see a unicorn fly across the screen followed by a VH1 logo. As for the actors most do exceedingly well in their roles. Although I was less impressed with the young British woman due to her overlydramatic takes I suspect it was the director who pushed for this style. I'm sure the actress had a better performance that remained untapped. Though nowhere near the pinnacle of LAGAAN KISNA is worth a trip to the cinema if only to admire the wonderful musical numbers and also to ponder what this film might have been if it had been in the hands of a more capable director.".

The direction is disjointed. The Debutante. Isha Sherwani is incredibly coordinated if Ghai has his way her Career will be on hold meditating at the end of the rope. She and Hrithik Roshan would make a great dancing couple in a Musical if only a good producer could take a hint. Antonia Bernath must have graduated from the Aishwarya Rai School of dramatic acting. She speaks Hindi with a Cockney accentand this get to be painful and ridiculous after a while. Vivek Oberoi this guy has no Screen presence for a leading part he should confine to playing hoodlums in movies like Company. The music is goodspecially the last duet is an absolute melody.

This pathetic attempt at a storyline ruins the fledgling reputations of Sachin Bhowmick  Farrukh Dhondy and causes further damage to Ghai's already in tatters reputation as one of Bollywood's erstwhile Moguls! Elements of Titanic and Lagaan were blended together in the hope of finding favour with the audience but the story bored the hell out of viewers who went in expecting a different storyline! The ills of Kisna don't stop at unimaginative screenplay but extend to direction as well. The movie drags adding to the viewers frustration. I've never been one of those who walk out from a movie halfway but in this one I barely held on. I walked out cursing before the credits started to roll something I make a point to see in other movies. Others didn't wait. They had long gone...Even the acting was below par. Vivek Oberoi disappoints but I guess even he saw no point in the movie  just went along with the director. The two lead actresses weren't much either. Isha  Antonia each bare half a breast in the movie but even that will not salvage this movie. One can only pity Subhash Ghai...This was my last Subhash Ghai movie. In spite of Trimurti  Yaaden I had thought a filmmaker of his ability would come up with something interesting but that was not to be. Once again we had to be reminded that all filmmakers one day lose their touch. It's happened to greats like Hrishikesh Mukherji  Mahesh Bhatt. To lesser ones like Prakash Mehra  Indra Kumar. For it to happen to Subhash Ghai should come as no surprise. The signs have been there for some time.What irks me most about the state of Indian Cinema are people like Ghai who make movies for commercial success. They are scared of taking a risk. As a result we have a slew of mediocre films. This mindset also prompts new entrants to the industry to ape former greats by playing safe resulting in more bad films. There are actors in this category too who prefer playing safe rather than acting... Actors like Shahrukh Khan.And there are the gutsy filmmakers and actors. Govind Nihalani John Matthew Mathan Aamir Khan. Their movies are the ones that one should look out for. At least they're worth the wait. And your money. Because for now I very strongly feel that Subhash Ghai owes me Rs. 160!".

But lately Mr. Ghai has disappointed to say the least.I fail to understand what the point of Isha Shravani's character is in the film. Okay so the girl can do a rope dance that doesn't mean you put that in the story. Her character doesn't belong in the story. It seems like Mr. Ghai used the First Draft of his film. Doesn't he think he should read his script over to make sure it makes sense? It seems like he wrote it then forgot about it and then saw this girl who could do a rope dance and figuredOh I should put her in the film no one has ever seen a girl doing a rope dance. Mr. Ghai needs to reread his scripts to make sure there are no loose ends he seems like an amateur with this film. When I write a script I read it at least 5060 times and keep changing things until it makes sense. That's what a good writer does. You can't be happy with the first thing you write that's just wrong.The story could have been so good without the Isha Shravani character. Her character totally screwed up the plot and the story. Mr. Ghai needs to stop making formula films not every film needs to have a love triangle. Stories can be told without triangles. Mr. Ghai needs to take some pointers from the like of Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Mani Ratnam. Stop making the same story over and over and over again. What an idiot! If you're out of ideas don't make films anymore we don't need to be tortured like this.Mr. Ghai needs to go back to film school and learn the latest techniques of filmmaking and story telling. I feel sorry for anyone who's attending his film school. Doesn't he realize that the audience is getting smarter...People will no longer accept the crap they dished out 1020 years ago. This film is actually worst than the worst films they made 1020 years ago.Mr. Ghai did everything in the film from Direction to Writing to Producing to Editing. He seems to be very proud of that fact because its there in BIG letters in the film...perhaps he should concentrate on just one thing and leave the others to professionals. Okay...I don't want to talk about Mr. Ghai anymoreHe's leaving a bad taste in my mouth.All the performances are average and I'm being generous here. The only one that stands out is a cameo by Sushmita Sen. Isha Shravani need to climb back up the rope she came down from. She can't act and the only reason it seems she's in this movie is because she can dance on a rope. That's the dumbest thing ever!! On the whole I have never said this about a film but...I WANT MY MONEY BACK...Don't waste your time or money on this one. Unless you want to see a girl spinning on a rope at 20 different parts of the film for no reason what so ever there is no reason to watch it. This is the by far the worst Subhash Ghai film ever. One expects more from him. DONT WATCH IT AT ANY COST. Even if it's the last film left on earth it's better not to see it. I'm so disappointed. I used to be a fan of Subhash Ghai films...Can you believe that!!!".

The only point which does affect is the length of the second half of this movie ! The visuals are at par with any Hollywood period film and the music is just awesome.I would suggest that everyone should check this film themselves and then form an opinion....because in my opinion the presentation style of Kisna is something which has not been attempted in Bollywood !".

However I found that Kisna is rich is content but low in actual reproduction. The film builds up good . There is this foreign lady Catherine who is in her old age and comes to India to relive some of her childhood and youth memories !!! The movie is in a flashback.She tells her story as Catherine having Vivek Kisna as a childhood friend. It dates back to the times of Independence and caters to a small place called Devprayag in Uttaranchal. Her father was an English lord and Kisna the son of one of his servants. Her father did not like her association with the boy and sent her back to England only to return in her youth.He had also grown up now. By then it was 1947. The smell of independence gripped everyone...... A revolt!! and her house and family destroyed. She was in danger and Kisna's mother orders him to plunge and fill his 'Karma' of protecting her and safely deporting her to Delhi . In the way he has to pass through a tough phase of defending himself and her from many people including his own brother uncle and many more. Finally he manages to safely reach her to Delhi where she asks him to marry her and leave for Britain.Though by this time he is also deeply in love with her he must fulfill his 'Dharma' now that is to marry his fianc Lakshmi . He departs leaving in her heart memories of love . Their love is thus immortalized.The songs were just superb and the music thanks to Ismail Darbar and A.R. Rehman  fabulous. Backed by great visuals and great performances notwithstanding the length of the movie which is quite longI think it would be a descent watch. I give it a 810.".

What I appreciate is that the revolution fight for Indian independence and HinduMuslim riots were kept as a backdrop and that the movie didn't sidetrack into a historical film. It is a love story from the beginning to the end. It is an interesting illustration of how love can cross cultures and is not skindeep. The movie also shows good examples of where the British and Indian culturessocieties blend to create harmony and clash to create havoc. I thought everyone gave a good performance. The visuals are simply stunning. This movie has a very good script with excellent scenes that truly touches your emotions. The only thing I didn't like is the picturization of the songs during the church scene. It was unnecessarily melodramatic and just plain out weird. Also two beautiful songs are just jammed into each other in an earscreeching fashion. Other than that though this movie is an awesome romantic adventure.".

In The Last Ride the same softspoken character is dealing with Scarlett who is bent on self destruction. Mickey was so very cool in this film subtle but never dull. Watching him pull off those subtle moves is a delight to see the guy is such a gifted actor and so underappreciated. The rest of the cast put in excellent performances including Rodney A. Grant and Brion James. Lori Singer who in many peoples estimation is no actress put in a very good performance as far as I'm concerned. She displayed a wide range and was very believable. But hey this was Mickey's film all the way. Can you tell that I positively love the guy????".

The fact he had an input in the writing may have had much to do with the decision but in retrospect it was a bad move. Had Rourke taken the role offered to him in 'Pulp Fiction' his status as a Hollywood king of cool may have been restored.It had already been badly damaged by previous efforts such as 'Prayer for the dying''Wild Orchid' and the dreadful 'Harley Davidson  the Malaboro Man'That he did not take such a high profile role in the wake of these box office disasters showed a worrying lack of quality control from such a gifted actor. 'The last ride' was a faltering love story also staring Lori Singerabout an out of luck former Rodeo rider and a socially damaged girl. The whole story has been done before with bigger budgets and better casts. Singers character ends up returning to the only kind of life she knows after meeting Frank T. Wells and ends up on the run.Rourke plays the 'Wells' character with the usual subtle charisma he that made him famous in the 80s but the supporting cast just isn't up to the job. Singer's character is pursued by the cops and this sets of the inevitable chain of events that become the movies climax. Whilst i wont reveal the actual ending I'm sure you can guess. Avoid it especially if your a Rourke fan this was his first big mistake.".

He brought the idea in exact wright manner to move you to make you think about it to make your brain chew the theme maybe even to change your views. Same goes for the movies. And this is an kind of a movie that makes difference probably this is one of the best M.R. movies. I don't want my moviehero to use a gun or be cool. All this naive state of being cool is temporally Pulp Fiction is not cool. Cool means stable state of emotions or mental condition to be able to have under control the negative reactions that may accure. If your moviehero using F word and every two minutes reloads his gun he is sick person and needs medical attention and that ain't cool. In this movie FTW lost his years in prison after his release he decided to move on and leave the past behind. Emotionaly and mentally he require full recharge of his lost strength. You can witness him being cool emotionally balanced person. He had all his reasons to use every second the cool F word or kill every cop in this movie trying to be die hard outlaw. But I guess it is much harder not to do that. I actually grewup with the movies like Desperate hours Barfly F.T.W. Angel Heart Johnny handsome etc I guess I saw all his movies but I've lost my respect for this actor after I've forced my self to finish watching Exit in red and then Point Blank. I had bad feeling that MR needed so badly money for a new operation so he was willing to make any movie just to make another buck to get another facelift done. Sorry MR I love your early work...

	schema:reviewBody "What's the first thing you do when you get out of prison after 10 years served for manslaughter ? Why you shack up with a woman on the run from a botched bank robbery in which 7 police officers were killed. She is also heavily traumatised by being forced to have intercourse with her brother for years and has an irrational need to commit crimes at all hours of the day. Not exactly the right course of action if you're aiming to make 'a fresh start'.Yes Mickey Rourke is a nice guy in this film. He may have been in the big house for a decade but only because he was defending a friend. Lori Singer on the other hand is every psychiatrist's worst nightmare. She is childlike and not in an endearing way. She holds up convenience stores when she KNOWS her face is all over the press. She is as dumb as a sack of doorknobs and incredibly needy to boot. A bangin' body is NOT worth the amount of trouble she brings to the table.One of the key problems here is the disparity between Rourke and Singer's character. He is so calm and collected and she is so whacked out and uncontrollable you wonder how they can stand to be in the same room let alone romantically involved. I could not believe in this relationship because the script gives us no reason why these polar opposites should be together... Other than it WANTS them to be. Especially during the ludicrous finale but I'll get to that later...If you like rodeo you'll LOVE this. There's lots of footage of Rourke's stunt double hanging on for dear life on those buckin' broncos. Funny thing is though... I signed up to this film because I thought it was a thriller not a documentary about this no doubt fine sport. And aside from the bloody bank shootout at the start there's nothing else here to justify that tag. It's just a dull slog through a turgid 'romance' plot featuring two people who might look photogenic having sex in the rain but have next to nothing in common. Which brings me neatly to...The last 10 minutes which were so stupid I was rubbing my eyes with disbelief. Rourke has just managed to win 5000 dollars at the rodeo securing their future. SInger's been her usual moronic self and has just held up a bank being shot in the process... and ruining what chance they could have had. So what does he do? FORGIVE her for everything does NOT take her to hospital while she's bleeding to death and instead goes on a HORSEBACK ride to the wilderness to bury her body. Later he's pursued by mounted police officers then killed by a sniper from a helicopter as he's retreating.He had NOTHING to do with the murders of the dead cops was clearly running away unarmed... and yet he gets a bullet in the back. Even in America this is indescribably harsh. In fact it defies all credibility. This is the sort of daft conclusion you scribble down when you have a 10 minute deadline until submission. Later the studio hands you your script back and apologises for putting you under too much pressure and asks you to rewrite it. Except it didn't happen here. Oops.The FTW of the title refers to Rourke's character's initials Frank T Wells and a tattoo Singer has stands for F The World.... nice. Not Free The Whales. Or For The Win. Just thought you should know. 410".

Especially the character intros the fadingtostylized headshots with big block letters. I found this resemblance pretty annoying in an otherwise more or less original film. You might find some more interesting flashbacks from the opening battle from the Gladiator and the shootouts from the Desperado. I hope next time Mr rpa will reinvent instead of reuse the great moments from other great movies. Two more weak points in the film the storyline has some unnecessary curves and one of the lead actors the Milkman simply falls out from the rest of the cast due to his inability to present his role properly. Really shameful.Now let see the good points. The greatest asset the filmmakers have is the cast. Apart from Mr Oszter everyone of them are just perfect. They do not seem to be actors however at least some of them are but real everydaylife guys. The curvy plot has several hilarious gags frantic losers fighting for victories in a typical EastEuropean way.The low budget only moderately visible it seems that the crew used the resources in a very effective way. This film cannot be swapped with a Hollywood action movie however successfully turns the weakness small amount of money into style lots of closeups cheap but interesting locations etc.In summary I recommend this movie to anyone who are not annoyed by strong language and lots of artificial blood marks and wants some treasure chasing gangsterfun.I just wonder how this film will perform in a nonHungarian speaking world ".

There are a good few things that you wont get or laugh at unless you are Hungarian so that may take down the value of the movie for some but than again this movie wasn't really intended for the US audience. While a good number of jokes are verbal the sheer stupidity of some of the characters is mind blowing.

Eventually the four stowaways separate with Chico and Harpo posing as barbers Groucho acting as the captain invading the sanctity of the captain's quarters where he and Chico makes themselves at home by eating his meals Harpo later chasing the young ladies as well as entertaining little children at a puppet show while at the same time making a fool out of Gibson.

MONKEY BUSINESS is pure Marx Brothers nonsense that appears to be every bit as funny today as it possibly was way back in 1931. Anything goes with this film including many memorable shipboard moments including Groucho's comedic dance with Thelma Todd Groucho doing his bit by posing as a reporter interviewing and insulting the cultured Madame Pucchi Cecil Cunningham in a manner somewhat similar to Margaret Dumont Groucho's frequent foil and straightwoman. GROUCHO Is it true you're getting a divorce as soon as your husband recovers his eyesight? Is it true you wash your hair in clam broth? Is is true you used to dance in a flea circus? MADAME PUCCHI This is outrageous! I don't like this innuendo. GROUCHO That's what I always say. Love flies out the door when money comes innuendo. the Chico and Groucho exchange regarding Christopher Columbus GROUCHO Columbus sailed from Spain to India looking for a short cut CHICO Oh you mean a strawberry short cut? Harpo coming out from a barrel of hay in the barn and seen kissing a calf and much more.As with most of the Marx Brothers films produced by Paramount MONKEY BUSINESS is pure comedy at best. Had this been done over at MGM where the Marx Brothers would be employed 1935 to 1941 MONKEY BUSINESS most definitely be toned down some in comedy antics with extended romantic subplots and straightforward and lengthy musical numbers. MONKEY BUSINESS has none of that. Unlike most Marx Brothers comedies their characters in MONKEY BUSINESS have no background no professions and no spoken character names the closing cast credits them with their first names only. They are just unusual stowaways trying to keep themselves from being caught and taken to the brig. However in this case MONKEY BUSINESS has its full quota of bellylaughs. Nothing really drags and nothing provided is unnecessary. And whatever scenes may not be of importance or interest to the viewers it passes by very quickly. MONKEY BUSINESS hailed as one of the top 100 comedies by the American Film Institute has become a perennial favorite to many Marx Brothers enthusiasts. After many years being presented on commercial television on the afternoon or evening to after midnight hours it became available on video cassette through MCA Home Video in the 1980s and to cable television on several channels from the Comedy Channel shortly prior to 1990 then to American Movie Classics 19911992 and a decade later on Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere December 17 2001. Regardless of its age MONKEY BUSINESS for all its silliness continues to bring laughter to a new generation of movie lovers whenever shown thanks to those funny men billed as The Marx Brothers. Because of them no ocean voyage would ever be the same again which is why no self respecting ship should ever set sail without them either. Bon Voyage. ".

	schema:headline " Zeppo's best Marx Brother Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Zeppo Marx is frequently considered with a trace of a sneer the fourth brother who was not worthy of membership in one of filmdom's two best comedy teams. He was the fourth brother of Groucho Chico  Harpo Marx and is only slightly better remembered than fifth brother Gummo who never appeared in any of their films. He looked the best of the brothers he was the youngest so he could play the romantic lead if nobody else had the role like Oscar Shaw did in COCONUTS. However although his appearance was better than the other three brothers he was not a really handsome man like Robert Taylor or Tyrone Power. Also he had a serious problem with his sense of humor  he had one but it was remarkably similar to Groucho's. In fact during the Broadway run of COCONUTS Groucho was ordered by a doctor to take a long overdue rest. He took off for two weeks and was replaced by understudy Zeppo. At the end of two weeks he talked to the producers and they willingly allowed him to take an additional week off. In fact when that was finished they said he could take more time off if needed. They were not in a rush to get him back. Suspicious Groucho went unannounced to the theater one night and watched Zeppo being so good the audience was laughing hysterically at his delivery and acting. In a single day Groucho returned to the show. Groucho never made that mistake again.It would have been impossible for Zeppo to have played a smaller version of Groucho on screen. There would have been an imbalance with two Grouchos in the films. So Zeppo was usually put into the films as Groucho's assistant or secretary or even his son in HORSE FEATHERS. His part in COCONUTS as the film exists today is not very impressive there is one scene where he and Groucho try to greet Chico and Harpo as new customers at the hotel and keep missing their hands. In ANIMAL CRACKERS he is Jamison the secretary to Captain Spaulding and has an amusing sequence regarding the immortal firm of Hungerdunger Hungerdunger Hungerdunger Hungerdunger  McCormick. In HORSE FEATHERS he did take part in the mad football game at the end of the film. In DUCK SOUP as assistant to Rufus T. Firefly he had more sequences that were funny such as when he gets slapped for telling a story to Groucho that Groucho had previously told to him. He also takes part in the Fredonia's Going to War number and in the battle section at the end. But only the Hungerdunger scene in ANIMAL CRACKERS shared by Groucho and this film MONKEY BUSINESS gives one an idea of Zeppo as an effective comic.Here unlike the other four appearances he is not connected in the past with Groucho. He is paired with him when he and Groucho are hired by Alky Briggs to be his torpedoes. However he is frequently chased on the boat and finds time to romance the film's heroine in one particularly good moment telling her of his eternal devotion to her just before fleeing from her side to avoid being captured by members of the ship's crew. He also is able to romance her at her coming out society party and rescues her from Briggs' gang. Here he finally does something normal to assist the film. He is a passably pleasant leading man but nothing spectacular. MONKEY BUSINESS was also surreal in it's humor best in the puppet show sequence and also the attempt of the four brothers to get off the boat pretending to be Chevalier. It is a very funny movie  maybe not the best of all their films DUCK SOUP or A NIGHT AT THE OPERA are that but close to the best. As for Zeppo he remained part of the act and the films for two more years and then quit both to become a successful film agent. He would always be in Groucho's shadow as a comic and even in death soon after Groucho's death in 1977 passed on with hardly any impact on the public. Had he branched out on his own if anyone had shown interest in such a move he might have had a chance to show his talents but it is problematical.".

	schema:reviewBody "In all my years of criticing films I have never found a team of comedians more funny more satirical or more flexible as the four original Marx Brothers. Their comedy and their formula works in ways that no other comedy team has ever worked and results like this their third and IMHO funniest film prove what film historians already know Groucho Harpo Chico and Zeppo are some of the most influential Hollywood legends to ever live!Monkey Business works because all of the brothers are given the same amount of screentime and each of their characters were very important to the plot. In movies before and after this picture more emphasis would be spent on different brothers in each film i.e. Groucho in Animal Crackers Harpo in Love Happy and the other bros would have little to do but stand their with their mouths open. Not so in this. They are all main characters here and each of them are allowed to stick to their own unique formulas that they are best at Groucho with his wisecracks Chico with his conning Harpo with his silent antics and Zeppo the straight man with his womenswooning.As far as plotline goes the four brothers play themselves stowing away on an oceanliner and constantly avoiding the captain and his crew by any means neseccary and I do mean by any means!. The story itself is a very serious one and it could have passed for a pretty good if bythenumbers gangster movie There are two dueling mob bosses on this boat one of which is trying to come clean after making his fortune. He has a beautiful young college daughter and he is trying to get his life straightened out. The other mob boss has a failing marriage with a beautiful young wife Thelma Todd and he by no means is trying to reform. He wants his part of the other boss's money or else he plans on kidnapping the daughter and holding her for ransom.So what we have here is a pretty standard serious plotline....The writers were very smart in choosing to make it one so that it would eventually become allthemore funny. Suddenly into this serious movie the Marx Brothers are dumped into the scene and everything becomes chaotic. Groucho falls for the bad guy's wife. Zeppo falls for the good guy's daughter. Harpo falls for any girl in a dress. Chico falls for a cow. Chico and Harpo are hired to protect the goodguy. Groucho and Zeppo are hired to kill him. In the meantime they are still on the run and are constantly trying to foil the plans of the Captain who wants to put them in irons. The results of their slapstick are all the better now because they are surrounded by a bunch of straight men who are acting in a very serious film...and it is their job to make it funny.There is no greater film that better demonstrates just how genius the Marx Brothers' brand of comedy truely is. Groucho's constant insults and depression puns Harpo's....whatever you call what Harpo does.... Chico's conning and comebacks and Zeppo's romantic Renniasance man Mary I'll never leave you he promises his love before deserting her as he runs away in terror at the sight of the approaching the Captain all make this the greatest of comedies. It also features probably their greatest screen moment All four must do a Chevalier impression to get off the boat and the results are....well....interesting.Don't miss this movie if you want your sides to split in half!Would you mind getting off that flypaper and giving the flies a chance? out of ".

	onyx:emotionText "In all my years of criticing films I have never found a team of comedians more funny more satirical or more flexible as the four original Marx Brothers. Their comedy and their formula works in ways that no other comedy team has ever worked and results like this their third and IMHO funniest film prove what film historians already know Groucho Harpo Chico and Zeppo are some of the most influential Hollywood legends to ever live!Monkey Business works because all of the brothers are given the same amount of screentime and each of their characters were very important to the plot. In movies before and after this picture more emphasis would be spent on different brothers in each film i.e. Groucho in Animal Crackers Harpo in Love Happy and the other bros would have little to do but stand their with their mouths open. Not so in this. They are all main characters here and each of them are allowed to stick to their own unique formulas that they are best at Groucho with his wisecracks Chico with his conning Harpo with his silent antics and Zeppo the straight man with his womenswooning.As far as plotline goes the four brothers play themselves stowing away on an oceanliner and constantly avoiding the captain and his crew by any means neseccary and I do mean by any means!.

	schema:reviewBody "Just as zany as monkeys going over Niagra Falls in a barrel this concoction of fastmoving sketches moves so fast you'll think you're heading over the falls too. The four brothers are stowaways on a luxury cruise ship heading to New York and for a good 34 of this movie they are doing their best to avoid being caught even though a good deal of that time is conversing in marvelous doubletalk with the ship's crew after them. They infiltrate the captain's quarters Groucho insults a wealthy socialite an unbilled Cecil Cunningham and infiltrates the captain's quarters and Harpo searches for his missing frog then attacks a passenger in the doctor's office who claims to have a frog in his throat. A magnificent puppet show has Harpo standing in for one of the puppets as crew members stand right near the puppeteer's box then he makes a hysterical escape much to the viewing kiddie's delight. Like the later Hellzapoppin' and the Zucker Brothers movies of the 1980's this requires repeat viewings to capture all of the gags or remind you of them because they follow each other so fast you will be dizzy trying to take it all in. There's the shell of a plot involving the kidnapping of a mobster's daughter once the ship docks in New York and of course this leads to more zaniness with the presence of the brothers. There's a classy parody of the Maurice Chevalier craze with all four brothers including the mute Harpo trying to get off the ship while pretending to be Chevalier singing A New Kind of Love. Sexy Thelma Todd the almost forgotten comical star of a series of Hal Roach shorts provides some hot cha cha as one of the ship's passengers who hides Groucho amongst her wardrobe which leads to some amusing dialog about Groucho being in the closet. This is one of those comedies you might consider buying available with all of the brothers' Paramount films because you might find yourself pulling it out on a regular basis.".

Yes Monkey Business is the one where he clouts the bad guy and wins the girl not to mention performs a mean Maurice Chevalier impression to help his brothers escape imprisonment. But he doesn't get much appreciation for his efforts. The fact the Marxes have little to do once they get off the boat is not my problem unless I'm looking for a plot in this intentional shambles of a movie.Recognized as the first Marx Brothers comedy to be based not on a stage play but original material supplied by S. J. Perelman Will B. Johnstone Arthur Sheekman a couple of uncredited script doctors and probably much adlibbing Monkey Business is the first comedy the boys shot in Hollywood after replicating a pair of their stage shows on a set in Astoria New York. We meet them as stowaways on an ocean liner staying one step ahead of the ship's crew with no money no food and a lot of complaints.I don't care for the way you're running this boat Groucho tells the captain. Why don't you get in the back seat for a while and let your wife drive?When the first mate Tom Kennedy suspiciously asks Groucho if he knows about a stowaway going around with a mustache Groucho is unperturbed Well you couldn't expect a mustache to go around by itself.Monkey Business is shorter on plot than one has a right to expect even from a Marx Brothers movie. It's 20 minutes before one even puts in an appearance when we meet gangster Alky Briggs Harry Woods and his restless wife Lucille Thelma Todd. How Briggs gets the idea that Groucho and Zeppo would make ideal hit men is something that never makes sense. Nor is it supposed to. The plot is just something to keep us occupied inbetween comic bits and odd musical interludes involving various Marxes.The film at times seems to make fun of this very fact. Groucho can't even bother to help out when his brother Zeppo is getting roughed up in a climactic battle instead providing boxing commentary as he watches overhead. Chico seems to sleepwalk through this film until he spots a piano to play while Harpo has his most famous moment taking over a puppet show.The jokes aren't all winners but it's hard to complain when Groucho delivers them rapidfire With a little study you'll go a long way and I'd wish you'd start now.About the only person other than the Marxes to make an impression is Todd with whom Groucho has a couple of amusing scenes. She'd be back for the next film Horse Feathers playing up her sexy flapper persona to even bigger effect.There are several odd cuts and the pacing really drags in the last half hour but give director Norman Z. McLeod points for giving the Marx Brothers a platform to play off of. Monkey Business is not a great film but it's a fine comic vehicle that holds up well.".

	schema:headline " Off to Hollywood";
	schema:reviewBody "After filming their Broadway shows Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers in New York the Marx Brothers headed to Hollywood to make Monkey Business. This was their first original screenplay and it shows how difficult it was to write for the team. Starting with the premise that they are stowaways aboard a ship much of the film consists of the ship's officers chasing them around the deck which quickly becomes tiresome. Add to this mix a satire on popular gangster movies of the day Little Ceasar and Public Enemy and you have a funny but rather confusing movie. Of course Groucho is going to pursue beautiful Thelma Todd even the fact that she's a gangster's wife doesn't deter him but it's more fun watching him make love to Margaret Dumont since we know the only thing he could possibly be interested in is her money. My favorite scene in the movie is the one where Groucho wants to be a gangster's bodyguard. Let's say there are two men trying to attack you and two men trying to defend you why that's 50 waste. Why can't you be attacked by your own bodyguard your life'llbe saved and that's 100 waste. You've still got me and I'll attack you for nothing. So it's settled I'm to be your new bodyguard. In case I'm going to attack you I'll have to be there to defend you too. Now let me know when you want to be attacked and I'll be there ten minutes later to defend you. Unfortunately this brilliant comedy writing is diminished by jokes which seem to be left over from the Brothers' vaudeville act circa 1917. At one point Groucho tries to give Chico a history lesson by telling him the story of Columbus. Columbus sailed on a vessel and of course you know what a vessel is. Chico Sure I can vessel whistles a tune. When he tells him Columbnus' men were going to mutiny at night Chico replies Nah no mutinies at night. Mutinies Wednesdays and Saturdays. Zeppo gives his usual wooden performance while romancing the daughter of Joe Helton. Groucho always felt that Zeppo never got an opportunity to show what he could do. He had talent but there were three brothers ahead of him. Yet his successors the bland Alan Jones the awful Kenny Baker and the hideous Tony Martin fared no better if you can stand it listen to Tony sing The Tenement Symphony in The Big Store it's perhaps the worst piece of music ever written. In short this is an enjoyable outing for Marx fans not their best but worth watching.".

The film looks good as well it goes at a snappy pace and the direction is spot on. And the acting with all four of the Marx brothers is most enjoyable.

There are no musical numbers involving secondary characters good but there is a piano solo and a harp solo backtoback in the last 15 minutes bad structure. Seeing this film today it is Harpo's physical comedy that seems the most timeless in my opinion. Sure Groucho could deliver his lines incredibly fast and some of those lines were decades ahead of their time but Harpo is the life of the film's most memorable bits like the puppet show or his impersonation of Maurice Chevalier. He is like a visitor from another planet where people are allowed to do all the things we want to do but can't. He's extraordinary. 12".

It's no surprise their early film Monkey Business is a collection of miscellaneous mix ups and quirky events all strung together by the vaguest resemblance of a plot. It's funny intelligent and some of the purest and richest satire conducted in such a loose form.The film involves the four brothers Groucho Chico Harpo and Zeppo who are involuntarily placed on a ship as stowaways to North America. Along the way they become mistaken for toughs who work alongside gangsters and eventually become the alleged heroes when one of the gangster's daughters is kidnapped. About half the film takes place on the ship itself before they reach land and believe me the laughs continue there as well.Let's be honest for a second and admit with what has been released over the last seventy plus years into the mainstream and what new groups have formed it's easy to dub the Marx Brothers films dated and unimportant when they are the direct opposite. Dated maybe I don't think I can argue with that. The standard of humor has greatly changed and it's beyond rare we get a slapstick comedy that brings to light humanity and wit. But unimportant is the polar opposite of the brothers themselves. It is because of the Marx Brothers Abbott and Costello and the Three Stooges that comedy evolved into what would eventually be a neverending supply of audience enjoyment. They showed us in the black and white days of cinema what humor was. Simple and effective little events strung together by the bare basics of a plot littered with verbal puns and lunacy with a little satire and commentary on the side to create a feast of humor and intelligence. In the day and age of limitless raunchiness and where repetition among tiresome jokes has become normality it is great to revisit a classic comedy like Monkey Business that relies on its own personal intelligence to carry a film. And at seventyseven minutes feels neither bloated or too quick and empty although the end like in many Marx Brothers films is a blink and you miss it sort of setup.Notable scenes are scattered amongst the camaraderie and zaniness of it all. One of them Chico does a beautiful piano solo the infamous and interesting scene that involves a surreal puppet show with Harpo who again gives us some of the most hilarious physical expressionist comedy this side of film and Zeppo for once seems moved to the foreground here and is presented during the second and third act as Groucho's righthand man. Zeppo has always been ostracized by Marx enthusiasts as the least funny brother and the one who was always given the role of the realist or the seriousman. Here he shows us that giving him a role that occupies zany quirks and goofball antics is truly doable. Monkey Business is an anarchic piece of work knows it embraces it and most importantly lives it.Starring Groucho Marx Harpo Marx Chico Marx Zeppo Marx and Thelma Todd. Directed by Norman Z.

	schema:reviewBody "Monkey Business is a film that gets right down to business the laugh business that is. No buildup of any kind it starts off with the Marx four stowing away on a transatlantic ocean liner and merrily eluding captain and crew.You can't go into any kind of plot there really isn't one. As it happens there are two rival gangsters on board the ship Rockliffe Fellowes traveling with daughter Ruth Hall and Harry Woods normally a western heavy traveling with his wifemoll Thelma Todd.Groucho and Zeppo get hired by Woods and Harpo and Chico get hired by by Fellowes. Zeppo has some misplaced loyalty though he falls for Ruth Hall. But Groucho sticks loyally by Thelma Todd too loyally in the mind of Woods.The action moves from the ocean liner to a society party similar to the one Mrs. Rittenhouse was throwing for Captain Spaulding in their last picture Animal Crackers. Hall is captured and it's up to the Marx to rescue the fair maiden. After all for the one and only time in their film careers she was the sweetheart of one of their own.Monkey Business is famous for the Marx Brothers affectionate salute to Paramount's biggest star at the time Maurice Chevalier. They all get a crack at imitating Chevalier singing a few bars of You Brought A New Kind Of Love To Me from The Big Pond. All of them mind you even Harpo.Monkey Business was also the first film the Marx Brothers did in Hollywood their first two The Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers were done at Paramount's Astoria Studio in New York. It was also the first film written directly for them for the screen. It's a comedy classic enjoyed by Marxists of all kinds.".

	schema:reviewBody "Without question Monkey Business is one of my favorite Marx Brothers comedies. It is full of fastpaced action and clever wit from start to finish and it never appears to drag unlike the previous two Marx Bros. films The Cocoanuts 1929 and Animal Crackers 1930.Here are my favorite highlights from Monkey Business if you haven't seen it don't read on. By far the best scenes in this picture are those on board the ship as stowaways Groucho Chico Harpo and Zeppo who are not given any character names perform every kind of trickery they can think of to dodge the ship's commanding officers. After harmonizing Sweet Adeline while hiding inside kippered herring barrels they rush over to an orchestra pit where Chico tinkers on the piano as the others pretend to be saxophonists. Harpo invades a Punch  Judy puppet show and with his famous Gookie face which in real life he adopted from a humorless cigar maker tricks First Officer Gibson Tom Kennedy into believing he's just another puppet. Groucho plays a few strange guitar interludes when the pretty Lucille Briggs Thelma Todd tells him of her desire for excitement and hotchachacha! But perhaps the most celebrated scene on the ship is that of the foursome obtaining the passport of actorsinger Maurice Chevalier and trying to impersonate him singing You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me for any of you musicians who are interested Zeppo sings it in G Chico in F and Groucho in Aflat. At the party Chico performs arguably his best and flashiest piano solo on film I recently learned that the title of the last tune he plays is When I Take My Sugar to Tea. And at the barn during Zeppo's fight with racketeer Alky Briggs Harry Woods Groucho becomes an unofficial commentator and Chico creates a roulette game with Harpo.Monkey Business is a terrific Marx Brothers film. The chaos and mirth are nonstop resulting in an energetic movie that is quite a joy to watch from beginning to end.".

Gilmour's singing and guitar work are through the roof!  Nick Mason's drumming was awesome.  Rick Wright still plays a good synth after all these years I liked hearing him sing Time.The extra musicians are also good.  Guy Pratt who is now Wright's soninlaw is awesome on the bass and when he sings Run Like Hell.  Tim Renwick's guitar solos on Learning to Fly and Another Brick in the Wall were cool.  Jon Carin is a good second keyboardist alongside Wright.  Gary Wallis's percussion was okay but he seems to be making Mason completely obsolete.They played the entire Dark Side of the Moon album.  Amazing!  The On the Run video was extremely weird but the end of the song is cool with the airplane that's as much as I'm going to tell you about that you'll have to see it yourself.  Gilmour does just as good as Roger did on Brain DamageEclipse.Also watch for the threepiece encore performance.  Wish You Were Here better than the original Comfortably Numb best version EVER I wish I was there and Run Like Hell ultimate Floyd party song!!Absolutely fabulous concert!

	schema:headline " Floyd redeems themselves";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the best concert films I have ever seen and Floyd more than redeems themselves for the absolutely crappy Delicate Sound of Thunder concert video.  Here it's like you are there with the audience.  The camera work does of a good job of making you feel that way and the sound really is crisp and has great clarity.  Dave Gilmour looks better than he has in years he looked like he was in fighting trim and he sings better and with more power as a result of it.  Dick Parry the bands original sax player was sorely missed and brings some breathtaking sax solos on SOYCD Money and Us and Them.  The encore to end all encores Comfortably Numb literally does bring the house down with some really amazing effects and just when you think its over they come back with a really good version of Run Like Hell. But what makes this video a collectors item is just a chance to see them play the entire Dark Side of the Moon set live in concert. I did miss Rachel Fury the really hot backup singer who toured with them back in '87.  Some people have said Floyd uses the laser and light show to hide their age but after watching this I hope I look half as good as they do in my 50's. Also noteworthy is the heartbreaking movietribute to Syd Barrett who founded the band along with Roger Waters in the 60's.  The movie is played with their standard opening song Shine on You Crazy Diamond and it's a really brilliant short film directed by Strom Thurgenson.  Barrett suffered brain damage as a result of his massive drug habit and its gut wretching to see his story played up there on that video screen.".

	schema:headline " better than Delicate Sound of Thunder neat setlist though not the very best of Floyd live";
	schema:reviewBody "It's terrific to see Pink Floyd playing well together in their megadynamic way here in the PULSE concert now remastered wonderfully for a DVD set. They go through many of their hits most notably all of Dark Side of the Moon and seeing the band go through Shine on You Crazy Diamond is as amazing as it gets from the group a great opener that is hard to top. And overall the core of the musicianship of David Gilmour Nick Mason and Richard Wright do gel together at times. But then there's the thing of it being such a HUGE event live lasers and special videos on a big screen behind them included that they have to work that much more harder to keep up with the theatrics. They're up to task but there's something missing from it all too and not just the obvious Roger Waters who is now doing his own version of this show more or less on his Dark Side tour. Maybe it's me putting it too much into perspective seeing the film that preceded this one some twenty years before Live at Pompeii PULSE isn't as forceful and tremendous even on such a scale as playing in Earl's Court to who knows how many people.I guess this is my way of saying that the concert for me at least is not a flawless one like Pompeii comes close to even if that is by turns not in the same style of performance as in PULSE. And in comparison with many of the classic Floyd songs of the 70s the newer work with a couple of exceptions like Learning to Fly and Keep Talking sort of falls up short with a song like High Hopes one that I fastforward past. But this aspect of the concert is not very detrimental just a minor liability for more diehard oldschool Floyd fans. In terms of just capturing the band live and the band with its immense ensemble of backup players and singers the director gets it all down without a hitch. If it also has a little added historical value to it too it may also be because unless something happens in the next few years and in 2006 both Gilmour with the occasional Mason and Wright in tow and Waters went on their own solo tours this might be the last time Pink Floyd are seen live on video.".

Rarely do we find an album that tells a story seamlessly.PULSE is the first live concert I have ever actually gotten chills down my spine during some parts especially the glass ball during Compfortably Numb and the incredible jam session One Of These Days. Their renditions of classics like Astronomy Domine Another Brick in the Wall and Shine On You Crazy Dimond all lived up to their respective history.The Great Gig In The Sky Is surprisingly well done. The three backup singers deservingly get their time to shine.But the absolute best and the one that really makes this DVD a must have to any musical collection is Compfortably Numb. David Gilmours' solo is unforgettable. The visual effects including the previously mentioned 16 foot wide glass ball perfectly moved with the mood of the song. When the ball opens its as if the entire concert climaxes.The reaction from the recordbreaking audience makes me jealous to have not been...there...to see it in person.

Songs like Run like hell comfortably numb The Wall Sorrow and a dozen others from all of his famous albums. Richard Wright who was the keyboardist died a few years back which halted the troupe's concert tour. Yet with all of the incalculable audience members who attended the concerts throughout the years Pink Floyd who consisted of David Gilmour Guy Pratt Nick Mason Dick Parry Tim Renwick John Carin and Gary Wallis gave the world a gift of the surreal the fantastic and the strange through their songs which will to this day survive another four decades.Like the album 'Dark Side Of The Moon' which for over twenty nine years has never left the charts of the top 100 billboard. No other group in history let alone the history of music has ever achieved such a feat. Since Syd Barret's death David often told the audience that his music was the pinnacle to their success. With drafts of original songs which later were recorded and labelled as some of the most ingenious material David had ever read and sang.After the album had left the charts most of the residual singles stayed on for another 1750 weeks which made Dark Side Of The Moon the most successful album to date. Even in the present times most of today's youth listen to these classics for reasons to them that they don't sound like a classic song Eg. Run to the hills By Iron Maiden or Relax By Frankie Goes To Hollywood. With their unique types of sounds people can distinguish those tunes as classical yesteryear albeit for some updated renditions to fit today's crowds. Yet Pink Floyd somehow managed to keep their stories blended well enough so that they can live on further into the future.Today however Roger Waters still hangs onto the idea that the wall is the ultimate concert. With continuous tours around Europe his blends of singing and keeping the band hidden away for most of the show somehow lost the audience's faith in the Genre. After some deliberations between Gilmour and Waters who was the original song writer for the movie The Wall... both had put away hatchets and began to give performances again together later in the early part of the 21st century. Since then Gilmour has more or less retired from the stage to appear now and again for other up and climbing bands who play and sing most if not all of their songs to newer audience members.Critics around the world has hailed Pink Floyd as The Ultimate Concert Band Of All Time. From the late sixties to now this band can never falter on giving those dreamers the best way to imagine the unknown the surreal and the strange. Highly recommended to those over 13.".

There will always be those who don't see this as Pink Floyd because Roger Waters wasn't involved but attacking the film for that alone just doesn't make too much sense to me. I will admit that I didn't care too much for the music during the first portion of the show which is included on disc 1 of the DVD. The show itself in regards to the colors is downright amazing as it's so easy to just get caught up in the terrific light show that you really don't need to notice anything else. However as a fan of music I must admit that I didn't too much for some of the songs including High Hopes Take It Back and Keep Talking. As you can tell these are all songs from The Division Bell so if you're a fan of that album then perhaps you'll enjoy the first part more. The second set on disc 2 kicks off with a complete playing of the Dark Side of the Moon album and it's beautifully pulled off with an effective stage show as well as strong performances vocally and musically. The entire album is pulled off to perfection and at times it's quite breathtaking to watch and listen to. The encore features fan favorites like the classic Wish You Were Here Comfortably Numb and Run Like Hell. All three encore songs are done terrifically and the lights again are just amazingly done. PINK FLOYD PULSE was a rather strange show for me as I really got bored during the first half but if you're feeling the same way it's certainly not worth turning it off. The light effects of the first half should at least give you something to look at and then the second half is a complete hit.".

The Pulse concert was a one and only.This is a performance it is a big stage production a rock concert and not a movie. But almost like a movie. Pulse was one of the largest productions of it's type possibly ever. Woodstock 1969 could not compete with that typification at least at least not in technical terms. There were a few very famous people up there in the video disc I won't say who. I have the first DVD released in the U.S. of Pulse. The disc or each disc have all types of configurations. Configuring the sound is the mainstay of the controls. There is even a pink generator and that is a real sound configuration found in rarer and older theater system. Also a configuration for the speakers. I do not not have a lot of concert videos this may be something normal.There are some very cool things going on inside that wheel which is really half a wheel. This is not to even include the lighting effects. The Pink Floyd concert includes marvelous laser light effects but there is so much more. There are singers for Pink Floyd's 1969 classic Dark Side Of The Moon. There are videos. There is so much included in this concert it is staggering. The first disc is music that came out later after Dark Side Of The Moon had sold millions of copies. On that first disc is beautiful incandescent lights not to mention the laser lights. It's all a spectacular show and the sound of Floyd does not run second rate to the visual auras surrounding the band.An excellent show from any point of view. Even if you do not listen to one of the original psychedelic bands from England. Turn the house lights down please..".

	schema:reviewBody "After band front man Roger Water's departure from the band Pink Floyd he thought that would be the end of the band but he was wrong and this is undeniable proof. Pink Floyd plays some of their best known songs here including one's he wrote and David Gilmour takes over vocals. Along with a great sound they managed this is also one of the coolest looking concerts ever. It's got full on laser shows along with a television screen in the middle playing interesting music videos to the music the band is playing live. It's quite a spectacle.The first half of the concert is mostly Pink Floyd's late 80s early 90s stuff which is not as good for the most part as what they produced on some of their classic albums but the performance is still great. The second half of the concert is the entire Dark Side of the Moon album with David Gilmour effectively taking over for Roger Water's singing parts on Brain DamageEclipse. They finish off the concert with some rewinds to classic songs Wish you Were Here Comfortably Numb and Run Like Hell. From start to end it's a really beautiful concert.This is an amazing concert but even as amazing as it is I only had one problem with it. At times David Gilmour would sing very oddly for the song he was singing. During Us and Them which is supposed to be a more peaceful song he kind of gave it a scratchy twist. It could be he was tired or just getting older but the occasional voice problems are noticeable but what can you expect. It's a live performance of 20 plus songs.Overall this is a great concert DVD. The light shows are very cool and the song choice is great also.My rating  12 out of . 120 mins.".

I thought they were all right but when I started to hear the guitar solo at the end of 'Comfortably Numb' I found I had forgotten to breathe for almost a minute. It is without a doubt the greatest and most euphoric rendition of that song David Gilmour ever did and the acoustics of the theater make it incredibly clear. It's even better than the studio version off The Wall. The rest of the concert especially performances like 'High Hopes' 'One of ThEse Days' 'Learning to Fly' and 'Run Like Hell' are incredible and I cannot get enough of it. Bravo Pink Floyd.".

But wow...quad sound in a stadium the complete Dark Side performance and the ending piece  Run Like Hell  amazing.

The newer material that the band plays is just as high quality as the older stuff of Floyd. It is simply a different era of the band. On the production side of things the visuals brought to us by Storm Thorgerson on the large circular screen are amazing. The whole light show raises the intensity and effect of the music to another level. The new 5.1 surround mix is also top quality. I got jumped at the beginning of the second disc when the voices came out of the rears instead of the front. I thought somebody else was in the room! Overall this DVD is enjoyable for not only Floyd fans but for anyone that enjoys good live music. I give it a full 10 out of 10.".

I ended up skipping all those songs because they have nothing of the beauty earlier PF records had. And then there's Another Brick In The Wall which has a good solo but it is still a very very bad song.And another thing I don't like the style of the show. Too showy and grandiose too much use of lightning background movies special effects and so on and you can barely see the band.

Though the story is very familiar it's Romeo  Juliet reinvented for India there is a tenderness and a freshness to the story which is difficult to articulate. It hearkens a very different era of filmmaking there is no gloss to speak of only story conflict and human relationships. Refreshing yes? Of course most people remember QSQT for introducing two young starlets who would go on to become superstars Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla. Aamir though undeniably charming is slightly awkward this actually adds to the performance contrasting Juhi's more confident and elegant performance. There is no denying that they make a stunning couple complementing each other as perfectly as other renown on screen pairs. Check out 'Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke' and 'Ishq' for more blazing chemistry.The other star of the film is the soundtrack each song is a classic my favorite being Aye Mere Humsafar which is soft sweet and perfectly singable. A MUST SEE and a MUST HEAR!".

He was brilliant in the film looked handsome and acted superbly the Papa Kehte Hain song made a special place for him in my heart. Juhi Chawla was great too and together they both made a quite cute couple definitely among one of the best bollywood has seen. All the cast's acting was topnotch be it Raj Zutshi Dilip Tahil Alok Nath and the rest. The film scored in ever department like music cinematography choreography background score the works. No one can forget the songs of this film like Aye Mere Humsafar Ghazab Ka Hai Din Akele Hain Tu Kia Ghum Hai the poetic lyrics and haunting tunes of these gems made them timeless. It is one of my most memorable and favorite films. It will not be wrong to say that QSQT is a true classic of Indian Cinema. It came at a time when crass wild and vulgar action films was order of the day it brought back romance and melody to bollywood and a whole new wave of romantic films started being made. Eventually the 90's decade was dominated by love stories in this context it is truly a landmark film in bollywood !".

It was the ultimate lovestory. A story about two warring families stubborn parents and despite all this the children of these families fall in love with each other. Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla were relaunched after making respective debuts in Holi and Sultanate and I don't remember having seen anybody else fresher than these two. Their pair was amazing. Actors and actresses now lack that innocence. There was no sex and no violence and yet the film had such a wide appeal. Actually the simple and the innocent approach of the film was it's greatest pluspoint. Another big thing contributing to the timeless appeal of the film is it's music. The late Majrooh Sultanpuri's unforgettable lyrics Papa kahte hain... Aye mere humsafar... Ghazab ka hai din... and all the songs and col tunes composed by the AnandMilind duo why don't they do something like this once again were matchless.

	schema:reviewBody "Indian cinema has offered so many 'young love stories' like 'Bobby' 'Dil' 'Tezaab' 'Ek Duuje Ke Liye' etc. However 'Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak' remains my favorite of the lot. It is a somewhat dramatized but humble adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet'. There have been numerous adaptations but what really makes this film work are the two leads and the music.I like how the character's were written. Raj isn't the typical macho hero or a romantic he's just an ordinary young who joined his father's fabric business. Similarly Laxmi isn't some damsel in distress or a clichd spoilt brat rebelling against her parents. She's a strong minded young lady who's ready to sacrifice all for her love.Aamir Khan makes his entry to Indian cinema as leading man. He does nothing short of a brilliant job as the naive young Raj. The fact that he's a newcomer only adds to the character's childlike personality. Juhi Chawla already shows that she's here to stay. Not only is she naturally vivacious but she in a wonderfully subtle way displays Laxmi's innocence childlikeness and determination. It's no surprise that since then Aamir and Juhi have been popular for their on screen chemistry. The supporting cast is adequate where Alok Nath stands out.Mansoor Khan's direction also deserves mention as he does not waste much time on unnecessary subplots. He stays mainly focused on the story of the two lovers. Only the beginning where the conflict between the two families begins appears a little too dramatic and clichd. But once Raj is introduced the film takes off towards a better direction. The background score is irritating most of the time.This was the time when great soundtracks were making a comeback in the commercial Hindi cinema considering that the 80s were infamous for poorest quality in cinema. The songs are soulful melodious and memorable. After all who doesn't know 'Papa Kehte Hain' 'Gazab Ka Hai Din' and 'Ae Mere Humsafar'? This is the album that made singer Udit Narayan an overnight star.To me 'Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak' is one of the most memorable tragic love stories on the Hindi cinema screen. What makes this film unique is the incredible chemistry between the two leads and their characterization. Simply great!".

	schema:reviewBody "Before you see this film a bit of confusion might take place. The last name 'Singh' is a very very common one in India and it is a name most Sikh families use. So when you hear about a feud between Dhanraj Singh and Randhir Singh it is NOT a family squabble but a feud between two Sikh families. However unlike a typical group of Sikhs both families lack the turbans extremely long hair and beards usually associated with male Sikhs. But as I pointed out they are not intended to be from the same family and the average Indian would know this. But since I live in the USA and many readers are not Indians I thought I'd include this in case there is any confusion.Qayamat se Qayamat Tak is an Indian remake of Romeo and Juliet set in modern times. However the film takes a few liberties here and there with the script. It begins with a man becoming engaged. On this day his lover Madhu comes to him to tell him she'd pregnant. He is callous and offers to pay for an abortion and nothing more. She is so despondent that she killer herself. Her family has learned what happened and they are furious. Her brother is so angry he shows up on the wedding day and murders the faithless jerk.Time passes. Now after many years the killer is set free from prison. He is still naturally bitter about the incidentas is the other family. Clearly they are feudin' families. Unfortunately for the two angry and dogmatic patriarchs of the two families two of their offspring soon meet and fall in love! Raj knows that Rashmi is from his family's enemiesbut she is a lovely person. He resists her for some time but after saving her from a gang of rapists he gives up and allows himself to fall for her. Rashmi at first doesn't know who Raj isbut she too is in love.As far as what happens next that is rather interesting. Apparently the filmmakers made TWO endings and tried them out with test audiences. The younger people liked a sad ending similar to Shakespeare and the older folks wanted a happy ending. Which version won out? See the film for yourself.I was surprised by this one. While it was generally a bythenumbers remake the film really held my attention and the ending practically made me scream out in surprise! It's an awfully enjoyable flickone of the better older Indian films I have seen.Finally I'd like to say a bit about the DVD packaging for this and many other Indian films. While I love the films many Indian DVD companies really screw their customers. They force the viewer to watch MANY previewseven AFTER you click to start the movie!! And you cannot skip over these easilyor at all in some cases. You could end up sitting through a half an hour of previews and ads before the film actually begins! In the case of Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak even after skipping through many commercials when you click Start Movie it won't let you actually see the film! You must go to the chapters section and click on chapter one manually! Additionally like some other Indian production companies the songs are NOT captioned!!! It's enough to make me watch Japanese or French films instead!".

	schema:headline " A true French masterpiece!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is probably the best new French film I've seen in this century so far. There have been some great ones including Noe's Irreversible Green's Le Pont des Arts and Hadzihalilovic's Innocencebut none of them come close to Les Amants Reguliers' timeless glory.The movie is a description of the events of May 68 and what followed in the wake of it and furthermore it is and update of and a homage to the Nouvelle Vaguemovies of those days. Concerning the depiction of the riots in Paris the movie is meticulously accurate I'm only 19 and I wasn't there myself but you know what I meanand the almost realtime and very long riot scenes set the stage perfectly for the aftermath of the events in the streets of Paris. The riots are not glorified or beautifully photographed like the ones in Bertolucci's The Dreamers to which the movie is comparable in many ways instead they are filmed in grimy black and white shots courtesy of the excellent William Lubtchansky. The love story that is the movie's main concern after the riots in 68 is filmed in stunning and far less blurred shots and manages to evoke true feelings of love and adolescent confusion in the midst of the otherwise politically concerned and seemingly cold environment.This film is a beautiful love story and it radiates through it that the director wants to depict his own experiences of those mythical late 60's which makes the film all the more compelling. But the film is also a homage to the whole Nouvelle Vague canon. Much of the dialogue evokes early Truffaut and the length and nonaction and plot less structure is reminiscent of Eustache or Rivette. There are even Godardlike verfremdungeffects with the persons looking directly into the camera and even addressing Bernardo Bertolucci directly. This film is no doubt an answer song to Bertolucci's The Dreamers and it is also a Nouvelle Vague homage but still it stands by itself as a beautiful and radiant love story.Bottom line This movie is incredible and if you love French cinema you shouldn't sleep on it. It may be the finest french film since Eustache's La Mamain et la Putain.".

There have been some great ones including Noe's Irreversible Green's Le Pont des Arts and Hadzihalilovic's Innocencebut none of them come close to Les Amants Reguliers' timeless glory.The movie is a description of the events of May 68 and what followed in the wake of it and furthermore it is and update of and a homage to the Nouvelle Vaguemovies of those days.

I'm seventeen so I obviously didn't get to live the events of may 1968 that marked an extremely important turn in French history but it doesn't really matter since I still really enjoyed the film. It's actually quite universal  people of my parents' age can identify to the characters and so can people my age. Garrel seems to perfectly understand young people the way they think and the complications of love as well as the loss of illusions concerning the possibility of changing the world. Maybe that's because the character played by Louis Garrel his sonis actually meant to represent Philippe Garrel himself. Well anyway great movie no action have to be honest on that point but so strong feelings that you can't possibly stay indifferent to it. If you're looking for a relaxing Sundayevening movie don't waste your time on this you'll be disappointed. But if you like cinema you'll like Les Amants Rguliers which is a bewitching movie close to those made in the 50's and 60's by the Nouvelle Vague artists.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing Les Amants Reguliers calls immediately for comparison with Bertolucci's movie 'The Dreamers' in my opinion the best film made about the 1968 revolt of students in Paris. Actually director Philippe Garrel does not seem to avoid comparing with his much more famous colleague sharing the principal actor and even including a direct replica eyeinviewereye about an older film of Bertolucci. And yet LAR is a different film and an interesting one.The story line seems also familiar. The movie starts with long scenes of the 1968 'emeutes' maybe among the best done until now. The film is made in blackandwhite and the perspective of the static camera on one side or the other of the barricade reminds Eisenstein. Then as in The Dreamers the action moves in the Parisian flat where the heroes of the defeated revolt make art smoke drugs dream and fall for one other. There is no direct social comment no real explanation of the background of the revolt. The movie focuses on the psychology of the characters and on the love story between the main characters. It's like a premonition of the process of transition to the establishment that the generation of the 1968 went through it's just that not all the participants may adapt or survive.The film is more about the characters than about the events. And it is merely for the style it will be remembered about. The blackandwhite cinema is memorable not only in the revolution scenes but also when looking at the characters evolution. Many sequences are enhanced by a technique that is derived from the silent films movies with long takes accompanied by a off piano tune. The effect is exquisite. Yet the length of the film is hardly justified it lasts more than three hours and I doubt that cutting it to only two hours would have been a miss  actually I am convinced it's quite a contrary.Without raising at the depth and subtlety of Bertolucci's movie LAR is another perspective to remember about one of the more important years in the history of France and of the world in the 20th century.".

	schema:headline " Not for the regular movie lovers.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie by Director Philippe Garrel is really hard to watch. I know this movie got a lot of praise from other critics but in my opinion it's not for any regular movie lovers. It's not entertaining enough to get people to watch 3 hours of it. It's so drawn out and so long to watch. It's 183 min for goodness sakes! 3 hours of a lot of boring scenes and few enjoying sequences and this isn't the Director Cut. This is the normal movie. Honestly in my opinion they could have cut some of the scenes down a bit. Rewrite it and have fewer scenes. The story takes forever to get started. A group of Parisian students find themselves caught up in the chaotic events of May '68 where students and workers strikes and almost gave France a civil war or revolution. When the strikes fail the young man Franois Louie Garrel and his clique of friends experience the aftermath of the events and grapple with their attempts to understand what has just occurred and move on after it. By having his son play Francois director Philippe Garrel is using him as a memento mori as a way to relive May 1968 through him. It seems to me that Philippe wants to relive the Bohemia Nouvelle Vague hippie culture again. I hate the movie for trying to make the police look like fascists and the revolutionaries as pacifist poets. It's truly not like that. May 1968 strikes honestly hurt France economy as some of the protesters were anarchist and Stalinist. If we study Russia's history. Communist is just as bad as capitalism. After the strikes the young adults choice to make love and art. This is where the movie get kinda boring. They talk while taking drugs. It's like watching two people mumbles and grunts follow with a few lines there and now. The action disappears and we are left with people talking a bit stare talking more a bit stare and then more talking. Once again half of the stuff they talk about isn't need in the film. In no way does it move the plot forward. It felt like a lot of filler scenes as if the Director took a smoke break and left the camera running. The movie seem to suffer from a lot of audio problems. Some of the scenes where they are talking you can hear the microphone brushing upon something deep breathing sounds or uneven audio tones. They are quiet one minute and then the other minute. Loud. The scenes are so short it cuts like crazy. The movie has a fondness for cutting from midscene to midscene and a few primitive dream sequences notwithstanding. Francois takes part in the French revolutions of 1789 and 1848 in his dreams but it's no way helps him step up another revolution. It's bothersome to have dream scenes and it goes nowhere. I did like William Lubtchansky's grainy highcontrast blackandwhite cinematography. The movie truly look like a student art film. The movie feels so art house film that I was afraid the movie would end up with words 'Fin'. It's like watching Bernardo Bertolucci 'Dreamers' 2003 film without the sex and nudity. Instead of bright colors we get none. The film's subject matter and casting mirrors that of Bertolucci but this movie lacks any entertaining value. I did laugh at one point one of Garrel's draftdodging rebels tries to set fire to the French flag and we see the whole awkward process. Other than that I was pretty bored waiting for the film to end. The music help me stay awake. While the movie wants to be Nouvelle Vague it's no way New Wave. They listen to singers such as Nico even with the fact that she didn't hit her peak until the mid 1970's and this was 1968. Most of the music choice sounds pretty classic orchestra to me as if listening to classical music. The piano plays during some of the talking scenes so I can barely understand or hear them. It's plays throughout the scenes and then suddenly turns off. It has no fades in or fade out. It's come out of nowhere and exits. It's a bit annoying to have random piano doodles of the opening chords from I Am the Walrus.. By far the greatest part of the movie is where several of his friends are seen dancing to the song This Time Tomorrow by The Kinks. It's weird in a way because the song was not released until 1970 two years after the movie takes place. I'm in love with this scene even though it breaks my heart. Francois's face at as he watches his girlfriend dance says it all. He can't enjoy himself because he knows this moment will pass his relationship won't last forever. He knows his girlfriend can live without him he cannot. Some of these people will break up move away move on get left behind and pass away. That's life. It will happen to everyone. The movie works with the theme of amour fou French for mad passionate love or obsessive love and how people deal with it. Friends fall out with each other and he knew change was happening. Personal gradually replaces the political. Francois watches as his group metamorphoses and as he falls in love with a young woman and starts to make new commitments feels himself changing as well. Like I said before it's a great theme about how life works but it's takes a lifetime on film to get this far. It's like watching grass grow. Overall this movie requires a commitment in time and brain power to make it worth seeing. No way is this for movie watchers. This is for people that have no life of their own and like watching other people lives. At less they should have made a movie about somebody's life who is more adventured. That would be fun.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie by Director Philippe Garrel is really hard to watch. I know this movie got a lot of praise from other critics but in my opinion it's not for any regular movie lovers. It's not entertaining enough to get people to watch 3 hours of it. It's so drawn out and so long to watch. It's 183 min for goodness sakes! 3 hours of a lot of boring scenes and few enjoying sequences and this isn't the Director Cut. This is the normal movie. Honestly in my opinion they could have cut some of the scenes down a bit. Rewrite it and have fewer scenes. The story takes forever to get started. A group of Parisian students find themselves caught up in the chaotic events of May '68 where students and workers strikes and almost gave France a civil war or revolution. When the strikes fail the young man Franois Louie Garrel and his clique of friends experience the aftermath of the events and grapple with their attempts to understand what has just occurred and move on after it. By having his son play Francois director Philippe Garrel is using him as a memento mori as a way to relive May 1968 through him. It seems to me that Philippe wants to relive the Bohemia Nouvelle Vague hippie culture again. I hate the movie for trying to make the police look like fascists and the revolutionaries as pacifist poets. It's truly not like that. May 1968 strikes honestly hurt France economy as some of the protesters were anarchist and Stalinist. If we study Russia's history. Communist is just as bad as capitalism. After the strikes the young adults choice to make love and art. This is where the movie get kinda boring. They talk while taking drugs. It's like watching two people mumbles and grunts follow with a few lines there and now. The action disappears and we are left with people talking a bit stare talking more a bit stare and then more talking. Once again half of the stuff they talk about isn't need in the film. In no way does it move the plot forward. It felt like a lot of filler scenes as if the Director took a smoke break and left the camera running. The movie seem to suffer from a lot of audio problems. Some of the scenes where they are talking you can hear the microphone brushing upon something deep breathing sounds or uneven audio tones. They are quiet one minute and then the other minute. Loud. The scenes are so short it cuts like crazy. The movie has a fondness for cutting from midscene to midscene and a few primitive dream sequences notwithstanding. Francois takes part in the French revolutions of 1789 and 1848 in his dreams but it's no way helps him step up another revolution. It's bothersome to have dream scenes and it goes nowhere. I did like William Lubtchansky's grainy highcontrast blackandwhite cinematography. The movie truly look like a student art film. The movie feels so art house film that I was afraid the movie would end up with words 'Fin'. It's like watching Bernardo Bertolucci 'Dreamers' 2003 film without the sex and nudity. Instead of bright colors we get none. The film's subject matter and casting mirrors that of Bertolucci but this movie lacks any entertaining value. I did laugh at one point one of Garrel's draftdodging rebels tries to set fire to the French flag and we see the whole awkward process. Other than that I was pretty bored waiting for the film to end.

	schema:reviewBody "It is hard to believe that this was 13 years ago.  Has it really been that long since we said goodbye to the BratPack?  When I watched Pretty In Pink it made me laugh but more importantly it brought me back to a time that was fun had less pressure  in some ways  and there were a plethora of films that were made aimed at us teens.  The early 80's will at least partly be remembered as a time when teen flicks ruled.  Everything from Fast Times and Porky's to The Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink they were all there and they all tried to do the same thing.  Entertain.  Sure John Hughes always seemed to have some heavy issues in his films but ultimately his films were there for us to enjoy for 90 minutes.  Pretty In Pink is one of the best at accomplishing that.What makes this film such the standout that it is is everything really. The actors were fresh and cool.  The dialogue was smart and easy for us to relate to.  The situations of love covered areas that we have probably all been through.  There was the unobtainable love that just seemed like a fantasy.  There was the two really good friends one male and one female that just weren't meant to be lovers and the heartbreak that one is inevitably going to experience.  There was perhaps not being accepted by your love interests peers and so on.  Watching this film I could understand how Duckie felt.  I could feel his anger when he watches his best friend and his secret love interest date the personification of what  and Andie  consider the personification of snobbery.  She has probably complained many a night about how she is tired of being treated unfairly just because she wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth and now she dates one.  I could feel Ducky's pain.  And that can be attributed to John Hughes for writing a brilliant script but also to Jon Cryer for making his character what he is.  You can sense his insecurities and his undying devotion to a girl that he knows he will probably never get.  And when he sits with Andies dad and chats about love there is one of the greatest lines in the film. Jack  Harry Dean Stanton  tells him that you can't force love it is either goging to happen or it isn't.  You can't control these things.  And that is what makes love so painful.  While you may be perfect for someone that someone wants the perfection of someone else.  And that sucks love's a bitch Duck.  Love's a bitch.Pretty In Pink epitomizes everything that made the 80's a great time for teen flicks.  Secret loves proms a great soundtrack and John Hughes. What more can you ask for?  This is one of the best.".

Everything from Fast Times and Porky's to The Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink they were all there and they all tried to do the same thing.  Entertain.  Sure John Hughes always seemed to have some heavy issues in his films but ultimately his films were there for us to enjoy for 90 minutes.  Pretty In Pink is one of the best at accomplishing that.What makes this film such the standout that it is is everything really. The actors were fresh and cool.  The dialogue was smart and easy for us to relate to.  The situations of love covered areas that we have probably all been through.  There was the unobtainable love that just seemed like a fantasy.  There was the two really good friends one male and one female that just weren't meant to be lovers and the heartbreak that one is inevitably going to experience.  There was perhaps not being accepted by your love interests peers and so on.  Watching this film I could understand how Duckie felt.  I could feel his anger when he watches his best friend and his secret love interest date the personification of what  and Andie  consider the personification of snobbery.  She has probably complained many a night about how she is tired of being treated unfairly just because she wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth and now she dates one.  I could feel Ducky's pain.  And that can be attributed to John Hughes for writing a brilliant script but also to Jon Cryer for making his character what he is.  You can sense his insecurities and his undying devotion to a girl that he knows he will probably never get.  And when he sits with Andies dad and chats about love there is one of the greatest lines in the film. Jack  Harry Dean Stanton  tells him that you can't force love it is either goging to happen or it isn't.  You can't control these things.  And that is what makes love so painful.  While you may be perfect for someone that someone wants the perfection of someone else.  And that sucks love's a bitch Duck.  Love's a bitch.Pretty In Pink epitomizes everything that made the 80's a great time for teen flicks.  Secret loves proms a great soundtrack and John Hughes. What more can you ask for?  This is one of the best.";

	schema:reviewBody "PRETTY IN PINK is the tale of an original but slightly outcast girl named Andie Walsh Molly Ringwald who is from the poorer part of her town. She never minded this until one day when the rich preppy Blane McDonnagh Andrew McCarthy asks her if she'd like to go out sometime. All of Blane's rich preppy friends immediately disapprove and Andie gets caught in the middle when her own best friend Duckie Jon Cryer disapproves as well. Andie decides to go out with Blane anyway although their first date ends up being somewhat of a disaster. Blane takes Andie to his friend Steff's James Spader house party where nearly everyone snubs her and Andie is embarrassed to let Blane see where she lives and what kind of house it is. In the end Andie has to decide whether pursuing potential love is worth the humiliation she receives from everyone else for doing so.PRETTY IN PINK is the last of the three famous Molly RingwaldJohn Hughes collaborations and is also the least favorable in my opinion. Which is not to say that it's not a good movie though. While its two predecessors dealt more with status and popularity issues this movie deals with a more serious topic of class differences. However I find this to be a pretty unrealistic scenario by today's standards and not very easy to relate to in my case at least. However the whole concept of two lovers dating despite their differences and everyone else's disapproval is pretty cool and receives my commendation. The ending though is a bit of a disappointment.What I really commend the movie on however is its portrayal of what love is really like. It manages to show just how beautiful it can be at times and just how destructive it is most of the time. Having experienced something similar to Andie's struggle I have to say that that feature of the movie made it a lot more personable and relatable for me taking on a deeper meaning than it probably would for others who haven't experienced such a battle.As far as technical aspects go... well what can you say. The acting is terrific namely from the alwaysgreat Molly Ringwald and the spectacularly wacky Jon Cryer as the film's most memorable character by far Duckie. Jon Cryer easily delivers the film's best performance along with most of its best lines. Annie Potts is also wonderful and funny as Andie's coworker Iona. John Hughes was a great director even though his area of expertise was '80s teen moviesbut let's face it no one could have done them better.To wrap it up PRETTY IN PINK is a cute love story with fantastic acting and characters that manages to capture a bit of the true essence of love even if it is a bit disappointing in the end. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "PRETTY IN PINK and Molly Ringwald were to the 80s as CLUELESS and Alicia Silverstone is to the 90s. An excellent cast and some fine acting were guaranteed enough to have branded this a teenage classic from the 80s. They don't make good movies like this anymore! The clever talent from John Hughes doesn't just mean it's a farout comedy but he expresses the problems of young love from central character Ringwald that sound dramatic and satirizing. In other words a girlmeetsboy story that offers a wide spectrum of situations that are confronted in the real world. Like I already said the cast is exceptional including the sensational Jon Cryer doing a lipsynching of that familiar tune from THE COMMITMENTS. Annie Potts is a pure delight at changing one wig after the next what a nice impersonation of Audrey Hepburn!. The movie wouldn't have been anywhere near complete without the memorable hit tune If You Leave Orchestral Manoevers In The Dark. While the end has a hard time getting things straight there is a valuable moment that caresses deeply. From start to finish this one still holds up against the recent string of teen pictures that aren't as cool or refreshing CLUELESS and REALITY BITES are the exceptions. A movie like this is great when it's not so raunchy.".

Right enough deep thought devoted to what should probably be regarded as another teen movie. I give full credit to Spader who fleshed out what could have been a onedimensional baddie by making him really interested in Andie in his own sociopathic way instead giving lipservice to a script that could have been played with the character being vicious solely out of hurt pride and snobbery.".

John Hughes was lucky enough to have a fantastic cast gathered together who help to breathe life into his writing. Ringwald especially was a terrific teen actress to snag for this type of material because there was noone who could do 'vulnerable' better than her at the time.

It doesn't matter that the crises don't add up to much when you think about it as long as they're sold to us in a way we can identify with.So far so snug then. The only glitch appears in the resolution where our heroine is encouraged to give up her individuality and that of her friend as a way for her to be finally accepted into 'the cool crowd'... What?! That isn't a fairytale ending it's a graceful swandive toward conformity! It's not a message I expected Hughes to be advocating and it taints the wholesomeness of the tale a little bit. Aside from that blip so close to the finishing line however this is an unashamedly feel good movie that won't corrupt impressionable young minds and is a unisex bit of fun.

	schema:reviewBody "... not even in the 80s not even in a teen movie in the 80s.This is a cult favorite starring Molly Ringwald as Andie a high school senior of limited means. She gets persistently bullied by the rich crowd at school. Her mom ran out on her and her dad and as a result dad is chronically unemployed and likes to drink but he's not a mean drunk. Molly also has to deal with Duckie Jon Cryer an amiable goofball who is madly in love with her.Andie is surprised when wealthy Blaine Andrew McCarthy casts an eye in her direction. However their dating is causing tensions among his elite circle. Or should I say elitist circle? They have all the charm of the French aristocracy before they were guillotined. Blaine asks Andie to the prom but when he comes up against brick wall opposition from all of his friends he wilts and pulls away from Andie making lame excuses about having already asked somebody else to the prom. She sees right through him. Meanwhile Andie's dad has managed to buy a pink dress at a thrift shop and she decides to fix it up as a prom dress and go to the prom anyways.How will this all turn out? Watch and find out. Let me single out James Spader as doing a great turn as Blaine's snobby friend Steff. He is the one who convinces Blaine that Andie is nothing special. Plus there is a scene I will never forget. At the high school as Andie passes Steff at a distance he gives her a look like she is something he scraped off of his shoe. It is creepy and it is real. Kudos to Mr. Spader for such a great early performance.The excellent supporting cast includes Harry Dean Stanton as Molly's dad James Spader perfecting his rich jerk persona Annie Potts as Andie's kooky coworker at a record store who thinks she is a relic because she is mid 30s Kate Vernon Gina Gershon Kristy Swanson Margaret Colin Dweezil Zappa and Andrew Dice Clay. The script by John Hughes mostly works and the good New Wave songs on the soundtrack add to the film's charm. I'm not exactly the target audience for teen romance films even thirty years ago when it was released but even I enjoyed it so if it's your kind of thing you should love it.Just one more thing...Jon Cryer grew up and filled out nicely. Who would have thought in 1986 that 25 years later Cryer would be the hunk and Charlie Sheen would have the appearance of a death mask. Go for depth girls you don't know what the geeky guy in high school will look like when he matures.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen all John Hughes movies from the 80s starring Molly Ringwald and you can't really watch them without comparing them. Sixteen candles is more of a pure teencomedy with a big house party followed by a hangovermorning and Breakfast Club is the most serious one and as far as I'm concerned the most distinctive of the Bratpack movies.Breakfast Club is the one I like the most but Pretty in pink is also a very good movie. Molly plays as always a very unusual girl who lives with her lazy but very caring father Harry Dean Stanton. She has only two real friends and one of them is a guy called Duckie. Duckie is kind of a geek and Jon Cryer does this part so good you don't even miss Anthony Michael Hall a bit. Molly also works in a record store owned by her other friend played by Annie Potts. Molly falls in love with a rich and popular guy McCarthey who has mutual feelings. The story is very clich with a rich guy and a poor girl from two opposite sides of society who falls in love causing disappointments among their old friends. Duckie is really hurt and McCarthey's best friend tells him to drop Molly mostly caused by jealousy in this case. This jealous friend is played by James Spader and he is very good at playing bad. The clich's are told with charm and intelligence though like Mischief and some scenes almost brings tears to the eyes. I wonder if the movie would have been even better if Hughes had directed it himself!? Anyway it's a sweet story with many wonderful actors typical of the 80s. Remember to look for a very young and very gorgeous Gina Gershon as a High School girl. The only thing I miss is a great song or two like the ones in Sixteen candles and Breakfast club. Otherwise if you're crazy like me about the movies from the 80s I see no reason to skip this one. This movie also has one of the most clever titles ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although John Hughes didn't direct this film his steady hand is evident all throughout in this much more serious story about a poor girl and a rich guy who want to be together despite all odds against them. Despite the more serious tone of this movie it still has some funny and touching scenes most of them featuring Duckie the best friend of Andie and perhaps the man that truly loves her. However she has her heart set on Blane the rich preppie who claims he doesn't act like his snobbish friends do but it is hard to tell at times.What makes this movie so great is how it is willing to treat all these kids as adults in real situations and real emotions. The acting accentuates these overtones with Molly Ringwald in perhaps her most sophisticated role Jon Cryer as the lovable Duckie Andrew McCarthy as Blane and James Spader in a perfectly devilish role as Steff the worst of the bunch by so smooth and relentless it is hard not to be impressed by him. All in all this is one of the better 1980s teen movies and one that I think people will remember more fondly as it isn't so overtly unique that people can relate to the characters and feel for them. Unfortunately it was essentially the end of the Molly Ringwaldera but her memory in these three Hughes movies will always stay with us.".

First off the cast Molly Ringwald Andrew McCarthy Jon Cryer James Spader Annie Potts etc all bring their own special something to the movie. Jon Cryer in particular is perfect for the character of Duckie an angstridden teen who yearns for Andie Molly Ringwald. They had a special showing of this movie in a theater in Orlando that I went to and Duckie still to this day had the whole audience laughing.I definitely recommend the soundtrack. It seems like every time I watch this movie and I've seen it so many times I find something new about it that I like even more. It's just such a cool movie about being independent and your own person. This is Molly's best role yet. Yes her fashion is very outdated but you have to realize that this was the 80's and Molly was trying to show her own uniqueness.I love the fact that Andie works at a record store Trax with punkedout Iona Annie Pottswho is her confidant and funny to boot. The record store seems like a place you would find one day and just feel special for knowing it's there. I love her pink car. I love the club they go to and the RaveUps that play onstage.In conclusion this is a fabulous movie. Especially if you love the 80's!".

	schema:reviewBody "Pretty In Pink is not my favorite of John Hughes's movies but I still like it nonetheless. PIP is about an unpopular high school senior Andie played by the 80s Teen Movie Queen Molly Ringwald who comes from the wrong side of the tracks. Her father is unemployed and she goes to a school full of rich preppies. Her best friend is Duckie played by the hilarious wisecracking Jon Cryer who has secretly loved and admired Andie since they were kids.Unfortunately Andie falls in love with a dull inept boring character named Blane played by Andrew McCarthy who is one of the rich preppies at her high school. I have to admit Mr. McCarthy has never been an actor that I have liked Mannequin was absolutely dumb and horrible and Weekend at Bernie's was even worse. It could have been because of this that I did not empathize with Blane at all or because his part was written in such a way that was so painful to watch even for all of Hughes's talent he could not salvage such an uninteresting character.James Spader was not bad as Blane's smarmy friend Steff who tries to destroy Andie and Blane's romance out of jealousy. Annie Potts as Iona  great! Especially at the beginning of the movie when we are first introduced to her she wearing the spiky punk hairdo and the fantastic jet black 80s jumper. Way cool. I was kind of bummed out when Iona is reminiscing in her apartment about her prom back in the 60s and then later when she changes to become more conservative for a man she is dating. I preferred the 80s Iona much more but Potts's Iona was a great character role and a perfect foil for Andie.And of course there is Duckie. Duckie besides the lead character Andie is probably the most interesting and likable character in the film. Sure he seemed needy desperate and lonely at times but in a very cute and sympathetic way. He seemed like a very quirky funny slightly nerdy but fun person to hang around with but maybe not necessarily someone who's a babe magnet like Steff or Blane but he had the real charm. He was someone who was downtoearth and not concerned with being an eyecandy stud whose main mission in life was to get a lot of girls. The lipsynching scene in the record store was classic. Personally I thought Andie was crazy  who couldn't see that this guy was madly in love with her? Who wouldn't want a guy so devoted and romantic as he was? sighSPOILERS AHEADOf course I was upset that Andie and Duckie did not end up together but perhaps they would not have been happy with each other. Andie only thought of Duckie as her best friend anyway and even though Duckie loved Andie so much perhaps she would have broken his heart because her feelings were not the same for him. I wish that he had only told her how he felt even though she may have disappointed him by saying she didn't feel the same way at least he would have known.Blane was a coward despite his turnaround at the last minute. The peer pressure of high school can be a great influence and in Blane's case it was for the worse. Hughes had said he changed the ending so Andie and Blane would end up together because he didn't want people to think poor and rich people belonged together. Sure that's a nice idea but I think maybe over time Blane and Andie would have not been happy either. They were from two different worlds. But who knows? Maybe it would have worked. It was a disappointment seeing Blane and Andie end up together anyway.Worth watching if you are a John Hughes fan. The soundtrack is fantastic as most music soundtracks from the 80s were. I give it 8 out of 10.".

It was a disappointment seeing Blane and Andie end up together anyway.Worth watching if you are a John Hughes fan. The soundtrack is fantastic as most music soundtracks from the 80s were. I give it 8 out of 10.";

This is one of my favorite movies. At this point I would like to say that I am a red blooded male and my favorite film is Fight Club. I do not like chick flicks but this film is pretty good. This high school dramacomedy is about Andie Molly Ringwald a beautiful and smart girl from a poor family her father doesnt have a job. This may not seem like a big deal but the fact that shes poor makes her a social outcast. She hangs out with people like her including her best friend Duckie John Cryer in his signature role. Duckie is COMPLETELY devouted to her. Anyone who watches them for a minute can tell that he is in love with her and he even admits this but she does not see it. She has eyes only for Blane Andrew McCarthy in a role he was born to play. Blane is the Romeo to her Juliet. He is rich  attractive popular and has everything going for him. He too hangs out with his own kind because unlike her he is rich and accepted by the in crowd. However he is different from the crowd he hangs with. He is a kind good hearted guy. He notices Andie's feelings and indeed he finds himself returning her feelings. They fall for each other but discover that their frinds and the outside world will not let them be together. Both of their best friends hate the fact that Blane and Andie like each other Blane's best friend Steph hates her bc he wanted to hook up w her but she shot him down and Blane ends up avoiding her which breaks her heart. He had asked her to the prom but he takes it back  saying he already asked someone else. You can clearly tell that this is killing him and he wants to be w her but he knows the real world will not let them be together. Finally at the prom Blane confronts her and says one of the most romantic lines to her in any movie. He knows that he screwed up and that he loves her. She knows this too and runs after him and they kiss ending up together. All in all a good film. Very enjoyable.".

Somewhat softer and more selfserious than the preceding teen epics Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club it tackles social cliques and classism from various perspectives. Ringwald and leading man Andrew McCarthy akin to Romeo and Juliet find their young relationship stressed by the negative influence of friends who insist they find someone closer to their own status. There really isn't much sparkle to the pairing though apart from a few awkward makeout scenes and they both come off as especially wet noodles in comparison to the vibrant brash supporting cast. Jon Cryer is most memorable of these as Duckie a flamboyant mod who's been carrying a torch for Ringwald all his life and nearly steals the film with an abrupt dancelipsync number just before everything gets overly angsty. Most of the third act is wasted on handwringing and moping though and the ending changed at the last minute much to Hughes's chagrin feels disingenuous even if it does make a better fit for the movie's theme. The window dressings are drowned in '80s flavor too from the appropriately synthy soundtrack to the Halloweengrade costume choices. Looks like everyone at this school was either Don Johnson Sid Vicious or Morrissey.".

She finds herself stuck between her likable but annoyingly obsessive friend Duckie Jon Cryer and a rich preppie with whom she shares affection Andrew McCarthy. Harry Dean Stanton plays her struggling father Annie Potts her older mentor at the record store where she works and James Spader the preppie's snooty friend. Andrew Dice Clay is on hand for a brief role.This is not a zany fun high school dramedy like 1984's Sixteen Candles it's too brooding and dramatic which isn't to say it doesn't have comedic touches. The first hour is relatively flat hampered by a feeling of unreality particularly Andie  Blane's horrible first date. Blane's decision to go to his snooty rich friend's party is bad and his decision to continue to hang around when it's clear Andie can't stand it there is stupefying. The original ending was reshot after test audience responded badly to the outcome. For me it makes sense the actual ending to the movie not the rejected one. The movie's not as good as Sixteen Candles which wasn't great in the first place but I'm giving it a marginal thumbs up.The movie runs 96 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.GRADE B".

	schema:reviewBody "For Love Of The GameMaybe I'm looking at this film through rose colored glasses. Sam Raimi is one of my favorite directors a real talent with visual ingenuity and a penchant for silliness. With last holiday's bleak A SIMPLE PLAN Raimi gave up his EVIL DEAD past and churned out the most satisfying dramatic thriller of last year. He is certainly growing by leaps and bounds as a storyteller and his latest film FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is another surprise for those of us who are fans. A truly elegant dashingly romantic whiteknuckled look at baseball and matters of the human heart GAME represents what a true Hollywood soap opera should be effective.Kevin Costner plays Billy Chapel an aging pitcher for the Detroit Tigers heading for the mound for may be his last time ever. The team owner has sold the organization to a corporation and they have plans to trade Billy. His arm continues to fail him more every time he steps up to thrown. And to top it all off Billy must deal with his tempestuous relationship with Jane a woman he met by a broken down car on the side of the road five years ago and has yet to fully commit to. With all these thoughts swirling inside Billy's head he unknowingly begins pitching a perfect game. Unable to keep his mind clear Billy thinks back on his life during the game and considers the mistakes he has made and the people he has met.Told mostly in flashback LOVE OF THE GAME is first and foremost a baseball movie. While being knocked for his recent professional choices yeah I liked THE POSTMAN say what you will Kevin Costner seems to have been crowned king of the baseball flicks. Ron Shelton's BULL DURHAM is pure genius the best baseball film ever. FIELD OF DREAMS is more like GAME both share a strong heartbeat and retaining a smart enthusiasm for the sport. Costner has been the glue that held both films together. He's always been a good actor only reaching brilliance once DURHAM. He has the rare charm the many actors forget to consider. While not technically proficient Costner knows screen charisma well. GAME gives us a desperate Costner performance one which lets the actor take his guard down for once. His Billy Chapel is a man used to success yet unsure how to use it to his advantage. A man who can hardly imagine himself consumed by anything but baseball. It's a great performance from Costner. My only hope is that public opinion doesn't tarnish the acting for the paying crowd.Kelly Preston has the more troublesome task of shining brighter than Costner. A working actress for sometime now this new film feels like the first time Preston is really acting. I enjoyed her supporting work in 1998's underrated JACK FROST and GAME finally puts her front and center. She bounces effortlessly of Costner and the two  while skittish at first  melt into a nice chemistry that packs more emotion than I expected. The loopy John C. Reilly BOOGIE NIGHTS and Jena Malone STEPMOM are also quite pleasant in small roles.Working with even more restraint than his SIMPLE PLAN Raimi brings to the table his gift for camera placement and visual tenacity. The baseball scenes in GAME are very romantic the title doesn't lie. A selfprofessed fanatic of baseball Raimi's love of the game shows in each shot. With noted cinematographer John Bailey the two create a pristine looking film. The stadium scenes are both frightening cinematic and realistic at the same time. The look of the film might not register with many people but I couldn't help but to admire such attention to detail.Screenwriter Dana Stevens made quite an impression with her spare and warm CITY OF ANGELS remake. What she brings to GAME is the feeling of courtship that I enjoyed in Costner's last film MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE. Costner and Preston really show the genesis of a relationship warts and all. The structure of flashback that Stevens uses to tell the story isn't as unfortunate as it sounds. It's all a rather nice mix of familiar baseball melodrama and a hearty dose of Hollywood soap opera. Stevens proves once again that she has a wonderful ear for romantic entanglements.Call me a sucker for the obvious but FOR LOVE OF THE GAME really worked for me. I really was moved by the story and enjoyed all the nuances and quirks. This classy film might not have a hero with a chainsaw for a hand a crispy scientist with a reliance on synthetic skin or a quickdrawing Sharon Stone. What it does have is strong emotional resonance. A audience film that the mainstream will love and the arthouse will abhor. I'll take that any day. 1010".

Set during one major league baseball game a man relives the past five years of his life from the pitchers mound. He realizes over what may be the course of a perfect game that his life has been anything but perfect. That the really important things in life are slipping away from him.This movie is full of life it's sweet. It draws you in and holds your interest. I think the movie was underrated because of the subject matter. A romantic baseball movie? but that's just the surface. This movie goes very deep. If you give it a chance you will see that the reality of the setting and the people are extremely captivating as well as fun. I can't think of another movie that has made me feel so good and so satisfied at the end. If you like baseball you can't help but love this movie. It's full of the most realistic ball playing I have ever seen in a film.If you like a sweet romance that doesn't have to rely on sex and nudity to tell the story well this is it. This has to be my all time favorite movie. I own it on vhs as well as dvd. The spotlight on location is a wonderful feature on both versions. It gives a fun look at the making of aspects. It also shows you interview clips from the professional ball people who were involved in the making of the film. I urge anyone who just wants to relax enjoy a good story and feel better for watching it to get this movie .".

	schema:reviewBody "Why do I love this movie so much? I'm not a baseball fan. I didn't really like FIELD OF DREAMS. And I hated BULL DURHAM. Yet this movie just captivates me every time I watch it.Part of it is the tight realtime structure  the whole movie takes place in a man's head while he pitches a perfect baseball game on the mound. It therefore combines the tension of a thriller with the poignant emotions of an elegy.But what I loved most about this movie is that there are no clichs. Kevin Costner's character Billy Chapel is not a sports underdog. It's very clear he is a great athlete who has had a great career and that he can walk away at any time with lots of money and lots of respect. The only reason that pitching the perfect game matters to him is purely for the perfection of his art  for the love of the game.At the same time not all the action is on the baseball diamond. In the romantic drama Kevin Costner does much more than play the usual Costner nice guy. Billy Chapel can be cold egocentric and difficult  just like any other creative artist. But he always surrounds himself with people who are strong enough to challenge him and help him stay grounded. It's no exaggeration to say that the supporting cast in this film  John C. Reilly as the catcher Kelly Preston as the girl friend and Jena Malone as the girl friend's adorable teenage daughter  are very much the stars. They really set Costner up for an unusually mature disciplined performance. Just the way Chapel's team mates set him up for the perfect game! This movie wasn't that well received by the critics. I remember one frightfully cultured fellow at the NEW YORKER sniffing that Costner's character is arrogant. Note well that if an artist or an intellectual is cold and demanding it's okay. But athletes should be jolly ape like simpletons the kind who know their place. This complex poignant movie is actually quite subversive since it forces you to realize that baseball is a thinking man's game and that athletes and their working class fans are not nearly as stupid as the real simpletons who write for the NEW YORKER.Shocking!!!".

The symbolism of the movie was the notion of ending a romance for the game and transferring that romance to a woman. For him at least there was room for only one at a time. And fortunately for her his career was at the very end. Fortunately for us we got to see his last game interspersed with flashbacks.The movie was brilliantly done with respect to the actual game of baseball. I cannot recall having seen a sports movie that did such an excellent job of maintaining accuracy about the game. I honestly could have believed I was watching an actual game. The plays were realistic. The situations realistic. And Vin Scully was sensational doing the play by play.I've only rated a few movies as 10's in my life. One of them was Field of Dreams  another Costner vehicle. This movie wasn't far behind FOD. In fact it was nearly as magical and it was a lot more romantic. Why the reviewers of IMDB only give it a 6.7 is beyond me.".

Driven but not a jerk and so the course of the relationship developed between the athlete and Kelly Preston's character is credible and engaging. The ways in which the other players are brought into the episodes that tell us about the main character resonate for amateur players and other baseball fans. All the performances ring familiar and true. Vin Scully is given the green light on cornball baseball homilies but just to have Vinny's voice seasoning the movie gives authority and authenticity throughout.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is one of the very best character studies of an athlete. The script the direction and Costner's performance yield an insightful profile of a driven character. Driven but not a jerk and so the course of the relationship developed between the athlete and Kelly Preston's character is credible and engaging. The ways in which the other players are brought into the episodes that tell us about the main character resonate for amateur players and other baseball fans. All the performances ring familiar and true. Vin Scully is given the green light on cornball baseball homilies but just to have Vinny's voice seasoning the movie gives authority and authenticity throughout.";

If a movie makes you feel a certain way whether it's anger or happiness I think it shows something.  For Love of the Game did that for me.  Costner's character excellently portrayed in my opinion loved baseball and in turn I loved his character. I loved the whole movie actually. It was funny at times symbolic at others and above all it was  quite enjoyable.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 10.

	schema:headline " ForkintheRoad Story Gives Way To Sappy Love Story.";
	schema:reviewBody "For Love of the Game is the story of one baseball player's final game shown through flashbacks from the meeting of a beautiful woman up to the final game in his career. It is a concept that could have worked if the film had not fallen to the melodrama of its love story. Where it manages to stay afloat is in its portrayal of its principal character Billy Chapel played by Kevin Costner. In one of the opening scenes Billy is confronted by the team's owner Mr. Wheeler Brian Cox. Wheeler informs Billy that he has sold the team and the new owners want to trade Billy. Since Billy is 40 years old and at the end of a poor season Wheeler encourages him to retire. Not exactly what Billy wanted to hear on an exceptionally rough morninghis girlfriend Jane Kelly Preston never showed up for their dinner date the night before. Soon Jane calls and tells Billy that she is moving to London for a new job and that she can no longer be with him. She tells Billy that all he needs are the ball the plate and the game to get by. With that in mind Billy heads out to the plate in Yankee Stadium to pitch the last game of the season. He throws well but the slightest reminder of the past triggers bittersweet memories from meeting Jane the flourishing of their relationship and their ups and downs. Then Billy remembers when he cut his hand in a sawing accident. Thanks to Jane he manages to get to a hospital and save his hand. But as Billy recovers he is faced with the notions that he might never throw again. Unwilling to accept this he pushes Jane away. This is the point in the present that Billy starts to feel the pain in his arm and his throwing becomes a problem. From the pain his arm to his regret at loosing Jane we see Billy struggle to top his career. But he swallows his emotions and pain and remembers the words of his father simply play catch Billy. Just throw the ball. With that Billy manages to pitch the perfect game. But naturally one thing is missing Jane and it all leads to inevitable airport confrontation ending. The problem with this movie is not in poor performances but rather in the sappiness of its love story. Preston plays Jane as the kind of woman who can make the simplest things complicated but with a genuine tenderness that cannot be denied. She is quirky but cares for Billy. But as the film goes into a montage of their early years we see just about every relationship clich play out. She asks him the foreseeable questionsDo you believe in God? Have you ever gotten your heart broken? And my favorite Do you like the dark meat or the white meat because the dark meat is the fatty part and it's not good for you. Between the rolling of my eyes and my cringing at the embarrassment of these questions I could not help but ask myself shouldn't they have established all of this long before now? The biggest problem is the ending. The two kiss and Billy says to Jane that he loves her. Jane responds I never believed it. Billy replies Believe it. The two kiss some more and fades out.

	onyx:emotionText "For Love of the Game is the story of one baseball player's final game shown through flashbacks from the meeting of a beautiful woman up to the final game in his career. It is a concept that could have worked if the film had not fallen to the melodrama of its love story. Where it manages to stay afloat is in its portrayal of its principal character Billy Chapel played by Kevin Costner. In one of the opening scenes Billy is confronted by the team's owner Mr. Wheeler Brian Cox. Wheeler informs Billy that he has sold the team and the new owners want to trade Billy. Since Billy is 40 years old and at the end of a poor season Wheeler encourages him to retire. Not exactly what Billy wanted to hear on an exceptionally rough morninghis girlfriend Jane Kelly Preston never showed up for their dinner date the night before. Soon Jane calls and tells Billy that she is moving to London for a new job and that she can no longer be with him. She tells Billy that all he needs are the ball the plate and the game to get by. With that in mind Billy heads out to the plate in Yankee Stadium to pitch the last game of the season. He throws well but the slightest reminder of the past triggers bittersweet memories from meeting Jane the flourishing of their relationship and their ups and downs. Then Billy remembers when he cut his hand in a sawing accident. Thanks to Jane he manages to get to a hospital and save his hand. But as Billy recovers he is faced with the notions that he might never throw again. Unwilling to accept this he pushes Jane away. This is the point in the present that Billy starts to feel the pain in his arm and his throwing becomes a problem. From the pain his arm to his regret at loosing Jane we see Billy struggle to top his career. But he swallows his emotions and pain and remembers the words of his father simply play catch Billy. Just throw the ball. With that Billy manages to pitch the perfect game. But naturally one thing is missing Jane and it all leads to inevitable airport confrontation ending. The problem with this movie is not in poor performances but rather in the sappiness of its love story. Preston plays Jane as the kind of woman who can make the simplest things complicated but with a genuine tenderness that cannot be denied. She is quirky but cares for Billy. But as the film goes into a montage of their early years we see just about every relationship clich play out. She asks him the foreseeable questionsDo you believe in God? Have you ever gotten your heart broken? And my favorite Do you like the dark meat or the white meat because the dark meat is the fatty part and it's not good for you. Between the rolling of my eyes and my cringing at the embarrassment of these questions I could not help but ask myself shouldn't they have established all of this long before now? The biggest problem is the ending. The two kiss and Billy says to Jane that he loves her. Jane responds I never believed it. Billy replies Believe it. The two kiss some more and fades out. It leaves you with nothing to embrace and the picture becomes instantly forgettable. You simply want to walk away saying Well there it is.What I do like about the movie is that the central character is faced with a life changing decisionending his career his life's passion.

	schema:reviewBody "I think this narrowly edges out Field of Dreams as the best baseball movie I've ever seen and I've seen quite a few. The concept here is totally brilliant. Costner's character  pitcher Billy Chapel is been having a bad day he finds out  that his exgirlfriend is leaving for England and then finds out that after playing for the Tigers for 20 years the owner is selling the team and he will probably be traded. On top of it all he is playing on a really bad team in the twilight of his career with arm trouble . He has to throw one more game which may be his last ever as he tries to decide whether to retire. The Yankees meanwhile trying to clinch the pennant and the Yankee Stadium crowd is appropriately obnoxious.And then suddenly he retires the Yankees one after another and is working on a perfect game. This is such a great topic for a movie because a perfect game is so rare that it is one of the most dramatic and exciting things in all of sports but the excitement and tension builds gradually. In the 5th or 6th inning it's no big deal but as you get later in the game the excitement builds and a meaningless game can become more suddenly become more exciting than the 7th game of the world series. I think the star of this movie is really Vin Scully he has long been my favorite baseball announcer and he really shines here. This is a baseball movie for real baseball fans you can tell by a lot of little things that they tried to make it as authentic as possible and did a good job. The photography and slow motion are used very effectively and Costner as usual in his baseball movies does a brilliant job of portraying his character. If you like baseball at all see this movie! It will be a classic 1010!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too long and that's not the worst of its problems.Perhaps the worst of its problems is that it tries to be two very different movies.On the one hand it tells the story of a great major league pitcher as he recalls the last several years of his life while pitching what starts out as an unimportant game and ends up becoming the most important game of his career. It is the story of a man who triumphs over adversity  pain in his shoulder etc.  to pitch a last great game.On the other hand it's the story of a man who off the field becomes involved with a woman who only causes him trouble. She wants him to NEED her and by the last scene though he has pitched a perfect game which is enough to put most men on cloud 9 for the rest of their lives he tells her that he NEEDS her they kiss in what is supposed to be a very romantic public kiss and one imagines that the producers thought that would win over large audiences of middleaged women.I can't watch this movie as a stereotypical woman  that's not how nature made me. I can only say that for me the romance was constantly aggravating because the protagonist allowed himself to become and remain involved with a woman who constantly wanted him to choose between her and his real passion baseball.But do many women really expect men to subordinate their nonromantic passions for them and tell them that they NEED them? Not that they love them which is completely understandable but that they NEED them? I don't know.So this is what the movie is about and it keeps going on and on and on with more incidents. The story simply does not merit going on over 2 hours about this.If you're looking for a baseball movie this is likely to disappoint you. If you're looking for the story of a man who comes to the realization that NEEDING a woman is more important than accomplishing something important in his life maybe this is for you. If you even exist.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Carolyn Polhemus a young prosecutor employed by the District Attorney of an American city is found murdered the job of investigating her murder is given to Rusty Sabich one of her colleagues and her former lover. The DA who is shortly coming up for reelection wants quick results but Sabich seems to be making slow progress. The DA is defeated in the election and Sabich finds himself arrested by his successor and charged with the murder. The evidence against him initially seems strong but more questions emerge during his trial. Is he really guilty? Is someone trying to frame him? If so who? Was the murder connected to an investigation which Carolyn was pursuing into judicial corruption? Or was it connected to her complex sex life? We learn through flashbacks the story of her affair with Sabich and that she was promiscuous sleeping with a number of influential men who could help her career including not only Sabich but also the DA himself.Besides being a legal thriller Presumed Innocent is also a study in contrasts in character either contrasts between two different persons or between the inner and outer person. Harrison Ford is often good at playing rather stolid individuals who have difficulty in showing their feelings but whose impassive exterior can hide powerful emotions. Norman Spencer in What Lies Beneath was one such individual Sabich is another. Both are men whose life spins out of control after they become involved in extramarital affairs. Fortunately for Sabich he has someone to take control on his behalf his smooth and fluent defence lawyer Sandy Stern. Ford and Raul Julia who plays Stern form a double act in the second half of the film both playing their parts very well. Sabich and Stern are both lawyers but with very different characters and different approaches to the law. Sabich is determined to tell the truth as he sees it the wily Stern sees the law as a game to be won on behalf of his client rather than a search for truth. If winning involves preventing the truth from emerging so be it.There is also a contrast between Sabich and his former lover Carolyn. While he is undemonstrative but inwardly emotional she is outwardly seductive and flirtatious but inwardly coldhearted. Both Sabich's wife Barbara seemingly noble and forgiving and the judge who tries his case may have hidden secrets. Raymond Horgan the DA initially seems to be a friend of Sabich but later turns against him when his selfinterest dictates.This concentration on character pays off raising the film above the runofthemill legal thriller. Contrasts between the various characters and their inner conflicts give rise to a gripping courtroom drama one of the best in recent years. The pace of the film never flagged and it held my attention throughout. The ending which I will not reveal has been criticised as either predictable or implausible. In my view it was perhaps unlikely but neither completely unbelievable nor inconsistent with what has gone before. I certainly did not predict it. This is a tense and watchable drama. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very good film centering around a murder investigation and trial involving a chief deputy DA and a beautiful young attorney in his office who is found murdered one morning.  The direction screenplay and acting are all top notch and you never really know how it's going to turn out til the very end.Harrison Ford is the deputy DA accused of murdering one of the female attorneys in his office.  Ford's character is that of a strident upholder of the law who strays into marital infidelity.  Caroline Polhemus played by Greta Scacchi is beautiful and manipulative using her sexuality to get what she wants career advancement and power.Ford is assigned to head the murder investigation team however his boss played by Brian Dennehy loses his reelection bid a few weeks later and the new district attorney charges Ford with Caroline's murder.  He knows Ford had had an affair with the victim and has physical evidence that he was at the murder scene and had been placing phone calls to her apartment in the days prior to her death.The continuing investigation by Harrison Ford's team of lawyers and his friends in the DA's office and the trial highlight the remainder of this film.  Events take strange twists and turns and the viewer is taken along for the ride without really knowing where it will take him.  The ending is a bit of a surprise and neatly ties everything together.The direction by Alan J. Pakula is tight and suspenseful.  I thought it was his best film since the early days when he directed Klute and The Parallax View  certainly better than the muddled Pelican Brief.  The overriding theme of the movie is darkness people hiding secrets from one another and the direction emphasizes that.  There are very few outdoor daytime scenes and most of the interior shots are of dark rooms and corridors.Harrison Ford is good in the role of the besieged deputy DA but I thought the secondary actors were the ones who made this picture as good as it was. Raul Julia plays Ford's attorney defending him in court and he's excellent I thought it was his best role in any film.  He's urbane and confident and he steers the defense through a very difficult set of circumstances.Bonnie Bedelia plays Ford's wife and her character is much more complex than that of the supportive wife standing by her man.  She also has dark secrets of her own and she plays the part with sly understatement.  John Spencer L.A. Law plays an investigator in the DA's office helping Ford Brian Dennehy plays Ford's boss who turns on him and Paul Winfield plays the judge handling the trial and all are excellent. My only criticisms would come from Harrison Ford's character who is so emotionally detached that it makes the circumstances of the affair with Greta Scacchi unbelievable.  He's not an easy person to identify with or feel sympathy for but the film is so well done that you can easily skip over that void and just sit back and enjoy the performances.".

	schema:headline " Excellent criminal law thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "As a thriller this is top notch as any kind of a movie it is also top notch. Based on Scott Turow's bestselling novel of the same name his first it relies on a wellcoordinated directorial effort by Alan J. Pakula Sophie's Choice 1982 All the President's Men 1976 Klute 1971 etc. a fine script by Frank Pierson whose credits include Cool Hand Luke 1967 Dog Day Afternoon 1975 A Star Is Born 1976 etc. and an experienced talented and welldirected cast headed by Harrison Ford Brian Dennehy Raul Julia Bonnie Bedelia Greta Scacchi and Paul Winfield.Ford plays Rusty Sabich a prosecutor compromised by his sexual obsession with a fellow prosecutor Caroline Polhemus Scacchi who is found murdered as the film opens. We see her in flashback as a conniving mantrap who uses her wiles to further her career. Sabich is assigned to the case by his boss Raymond Horgan Dennehy who is up for reelection. Sabich would like to recuse himself but Horgan demands that he take the case and get the perp yesterday otherwise they will all be out a job because he will lose the election. Bedelia looking particularly beguiling plays Sabich's sexually frustrated and deeply hurt wife Barbara.When the election is lost the new prosecutors arrest Sabich and charge him with murder. He is defended by the very smooth Raul Julia who plays defense attorney Sandy Stern. Paul Winfield in a somewhat flamboyant style plays Judge Larren Lyttle.Because Scott Turow knows the way the law works in practice as well as in theory he having been a lawyer before he became a bestselling writer we are treated to wood paneled intrigues and courtroom theatrics that have the unmistakable feel of authenticity. The dialogue is veracious and the character crosscurrents vividly real. Ford gives what I think is one of his best performances as a man tormented by his infidelity and caught in a vise of circumstance largely stemming from that infidelity. Dennehy is a bigmouthed and bigheaded politician in the familiar Windy City style. Raul Julia's Sandy Stern is cosmopolitan and brilliant cynical and slick a kind of Latin Johnny Cochran. Bedelia whom I recall best as Shirley Muldowney in Heart Like a Wheel 1983 manages a delicate and slightly unbelievable persona with just the right amount of forbearance so that when the surprise ending comes we almost believe it.I say almost but you might want to judge for yourself.See this for Harrison Ford who plays a foolish and morally compromised man with just the sort of right stuff and disarming vulnerability we've come to expect from one of Hollywood's most popular leading men.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

Battling the system that he knows inside out Rusty finds that there's a big can of worms about to be opened.A tip top court room mystery drama that we could do with seeing more of these days. Expertly strung together by the director of All the Presidents Men and Sophie's Choice Presumed Innocent isn't just a by the numbers legal who done it? The makers get in deep with the political machinations of a district attorney's office the intricate steps of a police investigation and of course the legal eagle operations of a court room. In to the mix is an horrendous crime of which a lawyer himself is charged with committing he may or may not be guilty of the crime but wonderfully we are never sure until the astonishing finale plays out. The air of mystery hangs heavy throughout nagging away like an itch you can't scratch with Pakula neatly unfolding the drama in a collage of flashbacks sideplots and present time intricacies. Mood is heightened by the photography of Gordon Willis who along with Pakula's looming camera work manages to convey a claustrophobic feel in keeping with an unstable marriage and a court room itself.A great cast is assembled for the picture. Ford expertly plays it low key brooding intently he makes us unsure as to his guilt or innocence and that's a testament to how good his performance is. Bedelia is excellent as the stoic wife holding it together as the marital cracks begin to appear and Juli dominates the second half of the picture as we shift to the court room. Dennehy does a nice line in morally compromised smarm and Scacchi wonderfully exudes a femme fatale sexuality. Winfield is a mighty presence as the judge presiding over such a tricky case and Spencer is as reliable as ever. Only disappointments come with the performances of Joe Grifasi and Tom Mardirosian who as the prosecutors come across as wimpy and hardly brick tight lawyers trying a high profile murder case.An intense and intellectual adult drama Presumed Innocent is one of the best of its type from the modern era. 8.510".

	schema:headline " Brilliant Narrative Play versus Shadows of a Heart A";
	schema:reviewBody "Bear with me while I set the context for my reviewOne of the stunning hooks in the academy award winning film The Sting 1973 10 nominations 7 awards including Best Picture Best Direction Best Adapted Screenplay is the shift of the narrative voice from omniscient perspective to a closed third person perspective ... when Johnny Hooker Redford and Lt. Snyder Durning are fooled by the FBI agents  we later find out the FBI scene was set up and scripted by Henry Gondorff Paul Newman as the critical step in making the Sting work. That one elegantly smooth unnoticeable shift is the crowning touch in an otherwise excellent film.In Presumed Innocent the brilliant change in narrative is the change in voice .. from that of Rusty Sabich Ford to that of his wife Barbara Bedelia during the final conversation between them in the story. The intricately subtle and carefully staged plot lets us follow Rusty's stream of consciousness as if he was in a trance .. a trance guiding him toward a full understanding of what really happened in the murder of his colleague  and a full understanding of his part in those events.It's a movie that you have to see twice to appreciate the excellent acting and direction. And if and when you read Scott Turow's book you'll want to see the film at least once again .. in which case you'll be more than impressed at how well the extraordinary novel was translated to the screen.The spare unobtrusive score magnifies the most compellingly dense scenes in which Rusty's awareness of what really happened evolves. If you want to know what John Williams can do with a light touch when he's not making epics like Jaws Star Wars Indiana Jones or Harry Potter you might want to play the film once more just to focus on tasting and savoring the audio portion of this program.Raul Julia nailed the part of defense attorney Sandy Stern Harrison Ford is phenomenal as Rusty and Bonnie Bedelia Brian Dennehy as District Attorney Raymond Horgan Rusty's boss Paul Winfield the trial judge and John Spenser as Rusty's friend Detective Lipranzer West Wing Leo McGarry  all turn in pro performances in support. Some significant credit has to go to the producers for assembling a magical cast.But be forewarned  this is dark magic. In almost every scene shadow and darkness is prominent and the scant few bright daylight scenes only set up contrast with the dimmer more murky more obscure moments. The desolate visualization is not bleak though to the contrary it's richly textured.

	onyx:emotionText "Bear with me while I set the context for my reviewOne of the stunning hooks in the academy award winning film The Sting 1973 10 nominations 7 awards including Best Picture Best Direction Best Adapted Screenplay is the shift of the narrative voice from omniscient perspective to a closed third person perspective ... when Johnny Hooker Redford and Lt. Snyder Durning are fooled by the FBI agents  we later find out the FBI scene was set up and scripted by Henry Gondorff Paul Newman as the critical step in making the Sting work. That one elegantly smooth unnoticeable shift is the crowning touch in an otherwise excellent film.In Presumed Innocent the brilliant change in narrative is the change in voice .. from that of Rusty Sabich Ford to that of his wife Barbara Bedelia during the final conversation between them in the story. The intricately subtle and carefully staged plot lets us follow Rusty's stream of consciousness as if he was in a trance .. a trance guiding him toward a full understanding of what really happened in the murder of his colleague  and a full understanding of his part in those events.It's a movie that you have to see twice to appreciate the excellent acting and direction. And if and when you read Scott Turow's book you'll want to see the film at least once again .. in which case you'll be more than impressed at how well the extraordinary novel was translated to the screen.The spare unobtrusive score magnifies the most compellingly dense scenes in which Rusty's awareness of what really happened evolves. If you want to know what John Williams can do with a light touch when he's not making epics like Jaws Star Wars Indiana Jones or Harry Potter you might want to play the film once more just to focus on tasting and savoring the audio portion of this program.Raul Julia nailed the part of defense attorney Sandy Stern Harrison Ford is phenomenal as Rusty and Bonnie Bedelia Brian Dennehy as District Attorney Raymond Horgan Rusty's boss Paul Winfield the trial judge and John Spenser as Rusty's friend Detective Lipranzer West Wing Leo McGarry  all turn in pro performances in support. Some significant credit has to go to the producers for assembling a magical cast.But be forewarned  this is dark magic. In almost every scene shadow and darkness is prominent and the scant few bright daylight scenes only set up contrast with the dimmer more murky more obscure moments. The desolate visualization is not bleak though to the contrary it's richly textured. Making hopelessness and forlorn human obsession palatable in a film is no small thing ... and this story is the journey of the soul in the small hours of a sleepless night.

Rusty is emotionally vulnerable in many respects and while he does not love Carolyn the feelings he has for her go beyond simple lust. Factor in the pure love he has for his son... Rusty is a complex and conflicted man. This did not transfer to the screen at all. I like Harrison Ford but he was totally miscast and was not able to portray the subtle nuances or vulnerability of Rusty's character.

For those who looks for a more convincing trial of injustice i will recommend Gavras'  Music box ";

	schema:reviewBody "It used to be doctors that boasted about the literary artists that rose from their ranks  William Carlos Williams Sir Arthur ConanDoyle Michael Crighton Frank Slaughter. Frank Slaughter? Now it's coming to be lawyers. Back in 1959 Anatomy of a Murder was a lonely best seller. Lately there has been a cascade of more or less autobiographical books about lawyers from the likes of Turow and Gresham. And the movies inevitably follow the bucks I mean the books.I wish Turow had used a little more imagination in cooking up the names for his characters especially since they seem designed to represent a little microcosm of ethnic identities. I guess Sabich is properly Polish and Horgan irretrievably Irish and lawyer Stern can be a Jewish lawyer who looks and speaks like a Puerto Rican. Polhemus may be a little unusual but not everyone can claim a hyphenized national allegiance.The attempt is weak with the Italian characters though. Molto? Too much for me to believe. And Della Guardia is plumb wrong. La Guardia is an occupational name meaning guard pretty much like Steward in English. But de la indicates a place name like von in German or van in Dutch. Della and Guardia are a mismatched couple. From the guard? It would be like an Italian novelist making up a character name like Cookson or Bakerson. The animal doesn't exist.Oh  the movie? It's okay. It rolls along in its sexy suspenseful stereotypical way an efficient example of how to reconstruct in an unidentifiable manner a story already familiar from The Big Clock and No Way Out and Where the Sidewalk Ends and a couple of others.Harrison Ford mopes efficiently through his part. I like Brian Dennehy a lot better as a nice guy than a heavy. Raul Julia is reassuring almost comforting in the role of Ford's defense counsel. If I were to be tried for murder I would want him and his underplayed confidence and his big dark gentle eyes to represent me rather than the skulky guiltylooking Ford. Bonny Bedelia is okay. Greta Scacchi is a knockout so to speak so it's a double tragedy when she gets her head bashed in. John Spencer is always reliable  or was. He died a month ago. Too bad a reliable New Jerseyish everyman.It's worth catching but not worth commenting further on.".

	schema:headline " Thin retelling of rich novel";
	schema:reviewBody "After an enjoyable read of Scott Turow's novel I settled down to watch Alan Pakula's film. I was somewhat disappointed and not just because of the worn videotape. It is a thin retelling of the story without the rich inner reflections of the book where accused prosecuting attorney Rusty Sabich narrates in the first person his trial on a charge of killing a fellow prosecutor and femme fatale Carolyn Polhemus.Adapation is always a bitch as Charlie Kaufman wonderfully demonstrated in his film Adapation but it works when the film makers realise that they are making a film and not prcising the novel. Alan Pakula himself did a very impressive job when he adapted 'the WoodwardBernstein expose of Watergate All The President's Men and produced a fine film. Here despite excellent casting and first rate acting what you see up on the screen with all the moody gloomy interiors is a hardto follow turgid courtroom drama.The book is an excellent account written from firsthand experience of what it's like to be a USstyle prosecuting attorney in a large midwestern city as well as being a reasonably intriguing thriller. However I have trouble with the character of the victim played with all stops out by Greta Scacchi. It's true there are women who play on the inability of men with power to behave themselves and they are a convenient plot device but we finish up not with a character but a stereotype. In the novel Turow does try with not much success to divine the reasons why Carolyn is what she was but the filmmakers simply abandon any attempt to explain her otherwise than to hint via her exhusband who does not appear in the novel that she might be some kind of fraud. Anyway I always feel that the amount of sex that goes on incidental to legal practice is greatly exaggerated and someone like Carolyn comes along about once a century. In fact the film and the book share one problem in common  the men are real enough but the women are caricatures.Turow is a far better writer than John Grisham but somehow Grisham's books transfer better to the screen. In fact it seems the worse the book the better the adaptation. However there are some moments when the actors transcend their material particularly Raul Julia's zenlike performance as defense counsel Sandy Stern. And it has to be said that Greta Scacchi does provide a reason for a prosecuting attorney on the cusp of middle age to throw caution to the winds and engage in an affair. Harrison Ford puts in his usual reliable performance but is somehow not in the centre of things it might just be the gloomy cinematography but I remember very few closeups of him.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love the Indiana Jones films. But in terms of Harrison Ford they sometimes overshadow what I will refer to as his more serious films. So when I see a film like 42 or this one I appreciate Harrison Ford's acting ability even more.One of the ways that I know this is a good film is that  aside from Ford  most of the actors are people I don't really care for. Brian Dennehy is usually a turnoff for me but I have to admit that here he was very good as the head prosecuting attorney. I generally don't like or dislike Ral Juli but here as the attorney defending Ford he was excellent. Bonnie Bedelia as Ford's wife is an actress I give little thought to and here she does her job. Paul Winfield is competent and interesting as the judge. Greta Scacchi as the murder victim and Ford's colleague is good and generally she turns in pretty solid performances though she seems to generally be under Hollywood's radar.The script here is very good particularly with the courtroom scenes that dominate the second half of the film. I do think that the film drags a little in places particularly in the first half. Considering the film's 127 minute run time there could have been some editing to tighten the action. There are a couple of nice twists and all the loose ends are tied together before closure.Nevertheless overall this is a class act so to speak and well worth your time. Highly recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "I love the Indiana Jones films. But in terms of Harrison Ford they sometimes overshadow what I will refer to as his more serious films. So when I see a film like 42 or this one I appreciate Harrison Ford's acting ability even more.One of the ways that I know this is a good film is that  aside from Ford  most of the actors are people I don't really care for. Brian Dennehy is usually a turnoff for me but I have to admit that here he was very good as the head prosecuting attorney. I generally don't like or dislike Ral Juli but here as the attorney defending Ford he was excellent. Bonnie Bedelia as Ford's wife is an actress I give little thought to and here she does her job. Paul Winfield is competent and interesting as the judge. Greta Scacchi as the murder victim and Ford's colleague is good and generally she turns in pretty solid performances though she seems to generally be under Hollywood's radar.The script here is very good particularly with the courtroom scenes that dominate the second half of the film.

It was around the time of my eleventh birthday and I was very pleased with the film enough to watch it more than once. I don't know exactly how many times I watched it but definitely several times. Years later after seeing that the IMDb rating for Jungle 2 Jungle was low I finally watched it again for the first time in I don't know how long and like I expected it no longer meant much to me.Michael Cromwell is a commodities broker in New York. It has been years since his wife Patricia left him and he now has a new fianc but before they can marry he must go down to the Amazon where his first wife now lives to make the divorce official. While there Michael learns that he has a son who is part of the primitive tribe that Patricia now lives with! His name is MimiSiku and while Michael is stuck on the island the boy turns thirteen the age which he is considered a man in this tribe. Mimi is assigned by the tribe's chief to go to New York and get the fire from the Statue of Liberty so Michael reluctantly takes his son home with him. MimiSiku has always lived very primitively and has never experienced city life so while in New York he is bound to unintentionally cause trouble! Watching Jungle 2 Jungle after my adolescent years had come and gone I didn't find it very funny at all. I smiled a few times mostly the parts where Richard Kempster Michael Cromwell's coworker played by comedian Martin Short throws fits but if I ever actually laughed it was very slight and if I saw the gag again I probably wouldn't laugh at all. For the most part I kept a straight face and found most of the movie quite simply boring. There are also some jokes that are a tad embarrassing such as Michael Cromwell lying awake in his hammock on the island while others around him are constantly farting in their sleep and quite a few embarrassing quotes that are supposed to be funny.It appears that Tim Allen has starred in a lot of movies that haven't been too well received. Jungle 2 Jungle is one of those movies and right now I can understand why. Overall this is a mediocre Disney feature in my opinion though many consider it lower than that. After enjoying this movie when I was eleven years old then watching it again after growing up and not thinking much of it I would say that it's definitely for the younger folk and for adults there are definitely comedies of this kind ones about someone living a primitive lifestyle somewhere in the world and coming to a city for the first time in their lives that are much more likely to impress you.".

The things he did were more embarrasingly stupid then funny and just didn't create all that many laughs. Now if we want to look at the point of view of the movie being meaningful as far as a fatherson relationship...well...ok a big time job oriented guy with a hot new girlfriend finds out he has a son with his devorced wife who is of course really cool and the two don't get along until then end when they suddenly do.

Part of the problem is the fact that the plot manages to be embarrassingly predictable from start to finish and provides nothing of value along the way. This is only made worse by the lack of laughs and the regular scenes of MimiSiku failing to fit in one of the most embarrassing of which sees him dancing with his father on the street. It is a string of obvious scenarios all run together just as you'd expect and there is nothing of any interest developed along the way. There are plenty of wild fish out of water in big city films already kicking around and this offers no reason to add this to the list of the ones you've seen.The cast are equally lost in the midst of all this stuff and resort to mugging and overplaying at every opportunity. Obviously Allen was going to do this anyway since this is what most of his films tend to be like. Martin Short does the same here and at least gets one maybe two laughs as a result  which is more than Allen. The clearly welloff and white Huntington is hilariously poor as the boy of the film he doesn't convince in any part of the film and is a big part of it being embarrassing. The rest of the cast have little to do and even a turn from Stiers adds no value.Overall a roundly poor film that takes the wild fish out of water in city genre ticks as many boxes as it can writes lots of predictable and weak scenarios and places them all within a story that is so poorly developed that you pretty much know where it is going from the very start. No laughs and no interest  it might work as noisy nonsense to distract children but it has no value past that.".

The real mom JoBeth Williams is believable as a post 60's Peace Corp leftover and villain played by David Ogden Stiers MASH is terrific as a scary and quirky Russian mafia boss.  It is a down the middle Disney preteen movie and fun.";

In one scene where the boy eats exotic expensive fish just hits the lowest of all lows. This movie is simply not funny. The premasis is terrible. Does anyone ever think about telling the kid that there is no fire on the Statue of Liberty? Does anyone ever think about teaching this kid some manners? It seems that a lot of the adult characters in this movie are actually dumber than the kid. There is no good chemistry between the kid and his father. At least they could have given us something nice like a scene at a movie. Instead this movie is about coffee more than it's about any father son relationship. Jungle 2 Jungle is not the worst movie I have even seen but it would make one of the 10 worst for sure. I try to stay away from bad movies but failed in this instance.

	schema:reviewBody "During his success in the sitcom Home Improvement Tim Allen's only good movie appearance was as Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story not even The Santa Clause made the biggest impact in Britain so this was his next attempt from director John Pasquin The Santa Clause. Basically Michael Cromwell Allen is to be married to his new girlfriend but first he needs to divorce from his separated wife Patricia JoBeth Williams living in Venezuela. So he travels there to settle things but he instead discovers he has a 13yearold son raised by the local tribe and named MimiSiku introducing Not Another Teen Movie's Ox Sam Huntington. Michael inadvertently makes Mimi a promise to go to the Statue of Liberty and bring back its fire ? so he takes him back with him to New York. What follows is obviously lots of slapstick gags relating to Mimi's upbringing so peeing in pots having a pet tarantula eating weird foods etc all making himself or Michael look strange. It takes a while for Michael to get used to having a son especially with all the background Mimi has but he is obviously very sad when he has to go back home but not before giving him the flame of Liberty a miniature Liberty a lighter with the torch as the flame cute and he does show up back in Venezuela for a little while. Also starring Martin Short as Richard Kempster Lolita Davidovich as Charlotte David Ogden Stiers as Alexei Jovanovic Valerie Mahaffey as Jan Kempster Leelee Sobieski as Karen Kempster and Frankie J. Galasso as Andrew Kempster. Allen doesn't do too bad young Huntington adds most of the quite light but still affective jokes not a bad family film. Worth watching!".

Basically Michael Cromwell Allen is to be married to his new girlfriend but first he needs to divorce from his separated wife Patricia JoBeth Williams living in Venezuela. So he travels there to settle things but he instead discovers he has a 13yearold son raised by the local tribe and named MimiSiku introducing Not Another Teen Movie's Ox Sam Huntington. Michael inadvertently makes Mimi a promise to go to the Statue of Liberty and bring back its fire ? so he takes him back with him to New York.

Over to your right you'll see a pigeon shot by Mimisiku with a blow dart on the top of a building in New York City. Wait a pigeon shot with a blow dart? Wow now this movie is stooping to a new low with it's Cannibal Holocaustlike plot line where real actual animals get killed through the eyes of the camera. How subtle. And then Mimisiku climbs into a woman's bedroom and says Nice PutchiButchi. From what he said I can tell it was something very dirty like a woman's EWWWWW!!! Don't make me say it!

He brings the child who has obviously never seen real civilization home. Madness ensues.My only complaints were that the theme wasn't very original and some parts just were plain not funny.

He and his fiancee are to be married soon and he is becoming rich and famous. Only one problem. He needs a divorce signature from his exwife living out on some forgotten island. But when he takes a trip out to the island in the middle of nowhere to meet his exwife he is promptly informed he has a son. Allen for some reason left untold takes his son back to NYC with him  again for no apparent reason other than a sappy feelsorryforson moment  where his son creates turmoil in his upperclass life. Of course this is a lame excuse for one of those kidfromtheoutside thrown into urban life films and quite frankly it just doesn't work. Not even Martin Short playing Allen's coworker can save this one. Tim Allen is a talented comedian with a history of both good and bad films. I enjoyed him in The Santa Clause Galaxy Quest Toy Story and Toy Story 2 but he's had his share of bad films Big Trouble and For Richer or Poorer rings a bell including Jungle 2 Jungle.One of the bad things about this film is that we've seen it all done before and all done ten times better. I've seen countless films where innocent outsiders are thrown into the urban life and must learn to adapt to their new world. Blast from the Past The Jerk That Other One with Brendan Fraser As a Cave Man and countless others included. Most of which have been done better. In fact all of which have done better. Yes even The One with Brendan Fraser as a Cave Man!For example take a scene where Allen's kid climbs the Empire State Building. A lot of potential there but it comes off very stupid. Unrealistic unfunny stupid and boring. Allen tries to keep this film on its feet but unfortunately loses his own while doing so. Martin Short shines every time he's on screen but not in a good way  more in a way of I have to use the bathroom NOW! way. They both try to use their great comedic talents to save this film but in the end it suffers. It suffers very very much.Oh and another thing This film is singlehandedly a ripoff of Herv Palud's film Little Indian Big City in which an Indian child goes with his father to France. He climbs the Eiffel Tower just like Allen's son climbs the Empire State Building. It even copies the birdshooting scene. I just thought I'd mention that.Anyway this film deserves to be in the bottom of a videodiscount barrel at WalMart. It's lousy. A true stinker.Avoid at all costs.1.55 stars".
