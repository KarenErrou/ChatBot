Well, if you like hamburgers give 
'em a try sometime. Me, I can't 
usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's 
a vegetarian. Which more or less 
makes me a vegetarian, but I sure 
love the taste of a good burger.
You know what they call a Quarter 
Pounder with Cheese in France?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Tell 'em, Vincent.

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
Royale with Cheese, you know why 
they call it that?

BRETT
Because of the metric system?

JULES
Check out the big brain on Brett. 
You'a smart motherfucker, that's 
right. The metric system.
(he points to a fastfood drink cup)
What's in this?

BRETT
Sprite.

JULES
Sprite, good, mind if I have some of 
your tasty beverage to wash this 
down with?

BRETT
Sure.

Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

JULES
Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
You, Flock of Seagulls, you know 
what we're here for?

Roger nods his head: "Yes."

JULES
Then why don't you tell my boy here 
Vince, where you got the shit hid.
