{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120611/reviews"],"review-text":["Blade (1998) is the best action/horror vampire slaying movie ever made! I always have enjoyed watching Blade. My number one favorite Blade film I love this film to death. It is one of the best action sci-fi films of all time. Wesley Snipes best role till it's days ever! No one can play Blade like Wesley Snipes did! Blade is not an origin story, but it is a real world of darkness. Blade is just so bad and anti-hero which is perfect for the world he drives in. It is my favorite comic book Vampire movie. I love this film, I love the action and I love everything in it! I love Wesley Snipes and Kris Kris Kristofferson so much they have such a chemistry between each other. Wesley Snipes Kicks ass!!!!! This is the most super hero Vampire slayer film ever made!  It is been so long since I last watch this film. I kept watching it 11.year ago in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was been released I kept watching Blade 1 and 2 on my CD on my computer and on VHS tape that I had this film. Blade of trilogy was the only film I owned on VHS I did not owned Blade II or Blade: Trinity at that time, but I have now the whole trilogy on Blu-ray. The best dang vampire slaying movie ever (say that fast five times)! Its funny too, it shows him killing a bunch of vampires but then regular people are thinking that he is killing humans! I watch this film as a child and all the blood in it and the violence made me crunch. I grew up with this film, 11.years ago kept constantly watching this film over and over, till it's days it is my favorite best Vampire flick. Blood and the crunch in this movie is AWESOME!! Just awesome! So In this movie Blade is a half human, half vampire, hybrid he protects the human race from other vampires and in this movie he has to stop Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff). Deacon Frost wants to resurrect the blood god \"La Magra\", And he needs Blade's blood and he needs 12 volunteers. So that he can walk in the sunlight and declares extinction to human race. Blade is humanity's last hope!Wesley Snipes plays a half-mortal, half-immortal charged with ridding the earth of a race of vampires led by Stephen Dorff in this action-packed blockbuster.This movie right here oh my god! is this movie AWESOME! Watching this as kid you really don't know much, other that Wesley Snipes is a Bad Ass!!!! But now when you are older you can really know how much of a bad ass Blade really was and he does making a point! Wesley Snipes is AWESOME! Yes awesome!So yea... Wesley Snipes does a good job in this movie, everyone does a great job in this movie, so far, even Donal Logue as Quinn with a long hair and beard hi did a wonderful job. Stephen Dorff is actually pretty good, I haven't really seen much of Stephen Dorff's work yet, I'm pretty sure he is not even around today, I am not sure what happened today, I'm not sure if he just drop off the map or if he just quit acting all together, but yea. You would never guess this was MARVEL movie because MARVEL's name was nowhere near this property so far. So that was kind a odd to see this choice but yea, we all knew who he is anyways, so that become kind a cool, and yea violence, blood, the gore amazingly AWESOME!!!!! Yea, I brought the word amazingly back. It is crazy, over the top, sword fights, knives throwing's, all this wrapped in the one and you get that final fight between him and Deacon, dang that is good time! That is good awesome times you know. And it is just nothing like that right now and I am hoping that we get another sequel to Blade: Trinity. The actress Arly Jover who played Mercury, Deacon Frost's girlfriend was so sexy and hot and she is so awesome with her hair and changing her hair styles for 11.years I was confused with a thought that Deacon's girlfriend was played by Traci Lords because she is blonde. It took me so long to figure it that out, that it was Arly Jover played Deacon's girlfriend and not Tracy Lords. What I like about the character Blade are his gadjets, the sharp ones in particular and his outfit and style! Bottom of line It is my favorite best film still I think Blade II is a little better than Blade, but I still love the trilogy. Movies like this don't exist today. The rating I give to Blade is 10/10","I didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks. Ever since the \"Batman\" series, \"Spawn,\" \"Judge Dredd,\" and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs, I dodged everything at all cost. I would question in my mind, \"why can't someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story, how difficult is that?\" And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade. This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, the good against evil, etc. Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks I've seen in a long time.","Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half human, half vampire known the daywalker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans (Food as he calls them) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world.This movie is well cast, written and directed; ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish. Packed with great fight sequences and slick dialogue, Blade is certainly more action than horror, but it definitely delivers.8/10","It seems to me that a lot of people don't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the likes. What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe. At least until he was reinvented.David Goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight. He can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character. The Blade character (Wesley Snipes) is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character. He is, however, a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in posture and is only interesting enough for one film (which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels). Kris Kristofferson is good as well and really brings the tormented character of Whistler to life with energy and sense of timing. N'Bushe Wright, however, is fairly weak as a leading lady making her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character. German, Udo Kier, should also be mentioned as he brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race, probably born of his experiences from playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains I have perhaps ever seen.The story is good and, I feel, renews the vampire genre (something that hasn't been done since Robert Rodrigues' From Dusk Till Dawn) by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel. By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. A lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible. Including the effects which are pretty good for their time. I found the vampire \"dustings\" to be a very nice touch. In stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously com-bust which looks great. The fact that the overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film which would otherwise have fallen flat on its face.As previously stated Norrington has a very distinct visual style that sets him apart from the directors of the following Blade movies. Del Toro is nearly as skilled but I prefer Norrington's style. His style gives the film a very special look and feel but most importantly it gives the film atmosphere. A very tense dark atmosphere which works great in tune with the main character and story. Along with the visual style the music which also works fine and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie.All in all Blade is a very entertaining movie that should probably have had an 8 from me but a few annoying flaws (which cannot be revealed without spoiling the movie, suffice to say, many of them are located near the ending of the film) does that the film must settle with a high 7.7/10","Blade was only a foetus when his mother was attacked by vampires and left for dead.  When he is born he is born a half-breed.  As an adult he has been joined by Abraham Whistler, a vampire hunter, to fight the secret war against the vampire culture.  He hunts the impure-blood vampire Deacon Frost who plans to summon La Magra - the Blood God.Now approaching it's second sequel, this film was a dark surprise to me as I didn't expect too much from it.  The plot sees Blade hunting a dangerous vampire seeing to unleash the power of La Magra and take vampires from their shadows into the real world; we also get a bit of back story as well. This plot gives all the best lines to the vampires and not enough good scenes with Blade himself.  I like Blade for the same reason as I like Batman - they are both messed up superheroes of a sort.  The film tells us how Blade was created but it doesn't delve deep enough for my tastes - only once or twice did I really get a feel for his cruel, darker nature (`Please, I only work for them').  I suppose this was to be expected and it certainly manages the darker tone much better than the Batman films did (in the long run).The action is good although it never really gets to the peak of the opening nightclub scene but is good nonetheless.  Some of the effects in the final fight are a bit lacking and they make the usual horror movie mistake of showing too much and having it be less effective than the build up and suggestion of the monster was.Snipes doesn't exactly display a great emotional range here but he is good in the title role nonetheless.  He is a commanding presence and physically good at the action stuff.  Dorff is pretty good as the main vampire - he is slick and plays it well to be a good representation of the `new breed' as the script requires.  Kristofferson is cool and Wright is sexy while still being a good actress!  The support cast contains no real standouts; Lathan is no more than a cameo and isn't really good while people like Lords only stick in the memory due to their name and not their performance.Overall this is an enjoyably slick vampire/action movie.  The end product may be more style than substance but the character of Blade is darkly interesting, even if neither Snipes nor the film really give too much away in terms of his inner workings.  I have yet to see the sequel but I would hope that it keeps the same dark tone that makes this film stand out.","If you like horror or action watch this film ASAP. If the opening scene doesn't get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse. Great Action, excellent casting and top one-liners. This is the only film I have seen in a cinema where the crowd applauded each chop, kick & punch thrown. Not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun. Its a pure rush of dark comic book action. 9/10","This film is superb! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the vampire hunter with pure class, he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud. The movie is a fast paced, thrill ride of action and superb stunts. The first action scene and last are outstanding and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads. The script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too. Wesley should have done more action films than he has, i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and perhaps Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close. Also aswell as Wesley being quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes should come across as menacing, but he does. Overall the film is sharp, stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace.","Blade is a fantastic action/thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yet.This film has everything that you would ask for in an action/thriller, it has plenty of blood, guts and gore, a twisted, disturbed bad buy, moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twists.Their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects, Wesley Snipes fighting movement is fantastic.This film is in my opinion a must see, Wesley Snipes cool, solid appearance makes this film and I can't wait for the sequel 'BLADE 2' being released next year.My IMDB Rating - 9 out of 10","I admit I go more for the traditional vampire tale, but this one is a real winner. Lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours. There was  loads of gore with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world. A good one for all us vampire lovers.","Blade is everything Spawn wanted to be and wasn't. While Spawn was a loud, obnoxious, incoherent mess that should have stayed in Hell with its erstwhile hero, Blade is a relatively subdued (it's nice to actually hear the soundtrack), stylish, well-directed movie that actually tries to build empathy and pathos into the characters. While both are adaptations from comic-books, only one is a page-turner.Blade, or Eric as his mom calls him, but which superhero would command respect with the name Eric, is half-man, half-vampire, made so by his mother, who survived a vampire attack long enough to give birth to him. This gives Blade a certain edge in his understandable grudge against vampires, \"all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses\" as his main vampire nemesis attests. The aforementioned nemesis is Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) who wants to unleash a vampire apocalypse on the world, decrying the Mafia-type approach that has served vampires so well up to this point - \"humans are our food, not our allies,\" he explains. Blade is aided by his mentor/weapons specialist Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) and a female hematologist he rescued, Karen. Her expertise lends her to both create anti-vampire blood, and a possible cure for Blade that would make him fully human again. Although one gets the sense that Blade's fate isn't entirely tragic. He relishes kicking vampire butt.The movie Blade succeeds for two reasons. It's technically polished, with good acting, excellent directing and production design, and awesome special effects - the way the vampires turn to skeletons and blow away like dried parchment when they die is way cool. There are three accomplished action sequences, the opening party scene which Blade inconveniently crashes, a brush with death on a subway, and the final conflict, with some special effects I can say, as a movie seasoned veteran, I've never seen before. The second reason is that Blade understands the inherent pull of the vampire myth. Vampirism represents a life given to sin, essentially. They are sensual creatures, dependent on flesh and blood for survival, shirking the light, and yet eternal, like evil fleshly lusts the Bible warns about. Vampires are not tragic, like Interview with a Vampire would have you believe, but fun, cool, and sexy. That's their power. Is not sin sexy? why would it be tempting otherwise? Vampires are cool because they live in sin without paying its consequences - death. But for that reason, they are the enemy and must die. For sin is, in the final analysis, bad. This essential good/evil conflict must be there for this type of story to work. Spawn had neither this nor the technical excellence Blade has, which is why it sucks so bad. Blade reminded me of another good vampire movie, Bram Stoker's Dracula, by Francis Ford Coppola. They would make good companion pieces on video.","Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! Let's start with the good things! The quote \"strong bloody violence\" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. This is not a movie for kids! Or for the faint of hearted! It has Blade as a central character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to hold/justify the action scenes! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. The action scenes are great here too.OK over to the things I didn't like. The overall story is too thin. It's enough as I've written above to hold the action scenes together, but there could be more. And a character like Blade deserves more (imo). The drama therefor isn't the best ... also it's use of clichés doesn't help. Some characters are underwritten ... That's that! :o)","Blade is a great movie. This film has so much energy that even I'm ready to go hunting vampires. For a film geek like myself, this film has it all. Wesley Snipes can finally have an action franchise and Stephen Norrington will be working in Hollywood for awhile. The screenplay is great, the cinematography is great, and the editing is awesome. The special effects are in a world of their own. This is one of th most thought out comic book based films you will ever see and it has a great cast. It's good to see Kris Kristofferson and Udo Kier. The only weak point in the whole film is the performance of Stephen Dorff. Dorff's character, Deacon Frost, seems rather weak for Blade. Can't wait for a sequel!!!!","This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it.  It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever.  I liked this one even more than X-men.  In fact, this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either.  Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade.  He is just not an emotionless super hero.  Also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating.  Sure comic books are for kids mainly, but I like a little more in my movies. Let's face it, if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic.  This comic book adaptation also has something that many don't.  A good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy. Let's face it, none of the Batman movies had a very good ending fight.","Blade is a great adaptation of the famous comic book series of the same name.  I'm actually surprised Entertainment Weekly gave it a D+.  Wesley Snipes is one of my favorite actors and is perfect for the role of the tortured half man, half vampire Blade.  Stephen Dorff is totally cool as Blade's young and psychotic arch-nemesis, Deacon Frost.  Blade's tight looking weapons too.  They range from a double-bladed boomerang to little capsules loaded with stuff that will blow up vampires.  Blade is a great film with two great stars, perfectly executed fight scenes, and lots of cool shots of vampires heads exploding. 10/10","This is a highly enjoyable horror/action movie. The film takes existing themes. Vampires, Techno music and Martial arts and creates something entirely new. Blade is a half vampire half human who devotes his life into killing the demons of the night; hoping to find the monster that killed his mother.Wesley Snipes plays Blade with a menacing tone and it seems like he enjoys it. The fight scenes are tremendous and well paced, with Wesley ripping out his opponents jugular. (literally).The music is again a bonus it fits in well with the mood of the film.All the cast members play their roles perfectly making it a enjoyable experience for the viewer.","Stephen Norrington's 1998 release \"Blade\" (based on the Marvel comic character) is the film that arguably lead to the recent trend of comic-book movies. It's success (along with that of \"X-Men\") caused people to do something they always should have- take comics seriously as an art form and a medium for storytelling. The film is an incredible, Gothic ride with great performances and unique visuals, and should be seen by any fan of action, horror or film in general.Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a half-human, half-vampire. His mother was bitten while pregnant, and his blood was infected by the vampire virus, granting him some vampire-like powers (such as inhuman strength), although he also suffers from \"The Thirst\"- the vampire's natural need to feast on human blood, which he combats using treatments and serums, almost like a drug addict. Blade and his mentor Whistler (Krist Kristopherson) spend their nights hunting and killing vampires who feed on the humans.At the same time, a vampire named Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorf) is plotting to overthrow the noble heads of the various vampire clans, and using them as sacrifices to bring about \"La Magra\" a vampyric blood-god, to destroy humanity and grant himself untold power. Blade and Whistler (along with help from a pathologist played by N'Bushe Wright) must figure out a way to stop Frost's deadly plans before he wipes out all of humanity.The film is truly dark and Gothic. Norrington's direction sets an ominous and deadly mood, and the visuals are all well-crafted. The score by Mark Isham is tragic and melancholy, with some nice techno-y action music thrown in for good measure.Acting is generally good (though Dorf does get a little hammy at times) and everything meshes quite well. The action is nice, though it feels a little staged and over-choreographed, and the visual effects, for the time, were outstanding. I should also mention that this is a violent, violent film. It is the bloodiest of the three movies, and has a lot of gore, which actually almost took me \"out\" of the movie a few times- some scenes felt campy with the sheer amount of carnage and goo being flung at the screen.In addition, there are a couple of scenes and jokes that stick out like a sore thumb, and the tone is a bit too oppressive, making this a hard movie to sit through if you are not in the right mood.I'm giving this a good 8 out of 10. I'd highly recommend it to fans of action and horror. It is a strong vampire film. (Also, a cool note, this movie is one of the several pre-\"Matrix\" films to utilize \"bullet-time\", that cool trick where action slows down dramatically to the point where you can see individual bullets whooshing through the air. Just a fun little piece of trivia- \"The Matrix\" did not invent this trick.)","Fantastically shot, well paced.. arguably Snipes' most impressive performance to date and lots of fun martial arts fight sequences involving swords and guns - not to mention the unique and timeless soundtrack. Blade is one of my favourite action movies of all time, up there with Die Hard and Predator.Director Stephen Norrington is what Chris Cunningham (Aphex Twin videos) would have been if he dropped the weirdness and went into more conventional movies.. or if David Fincher stopped with the thrillers and did straight action. It is a massive shame we couldn't see more from Stephen, but at least we have Blade.Certain special effects haven't aged well (and are in desperate need of a remaster!) but aside from that, this movie is great visually. Norrington's choice of shots, the way scenes are lit is masterful.The performances he gets out of his actors are great too. It's not surprising Snipes loved the Blade character so much as to later method act and speak to cast/crew in character.. not surprising at all when the first movie of the trilogy this strong (though I pretend Blade 2 and 3 never happened) Watch this movie if you haven't already, especially if you love the 90s aesthetic or if you enjoy vampire-related movies/TV shows. The Blade character is iconic and Snipes was born to play him, and this movie is a 2 hour proof-of-concept for Norrington being the greatest director nobody ever talks about.","Blade (1998) is an entertaining action film that looks and sounds good - or should I say ”cool” because that surely has been the aim with all the sunglasses, swords, camera-run gimmicks and whatnots. Wesley Snipes plays (and growls his way through) the lead – a vampire hunter called Blade – and does it rather well. A lot of action set to the heavily tecno/hiphop -based soundtrack is what the film is all about, with some humour and drama thrown in time to time. Kris Kristofferson (Whistler), N'Bushe Wright (Karen) and Stephen Dorff (Deacon Frost) support in the cast. The film's opening scene is a great one and it's rather sad that the rest of the movie doesn't quite manage to stay on the same level – we've seen the best the film has to offer after the first ten minutes or so.Blade is kinda cheesy fun, a guilty pleasure of some sort. It's over the top in in a lot of ways (starting from Wesley's growling, continuing with the often ridiculous use of music and ending with the endless sunglass-related jokes) and does it shamelessly too. You might not love the movie or anything but somehow you take a seat on the sofa every time the film's on TV. 3/4","Blade is supposed to be a Dhampyr (child of a male vampire and living woman). This is a well established legend and the story of the comics. Why on earth they go about changing the 'bible on vampires' making it some fluke of a 'biting gone bad.' Whistler was well done, and Blade was done true enough to the original character. As an action film it is more than satisfactory.I couldn't stand that they were working a 'cure.' As if anything that could make the blood suckers would or even could be based in science. Heck, the vampires weren't even half the beast they should be. I am not a purest to fantasy, Vampire can but don't have to be weak to crosses, rose wood, or garlic, but either make something new or don't; don't butcher an ancient and complex mythos like the Vampyr or Lycanthorp. In \"From Dusk til Dawn\" they establish that these creatures are vampire like and may have established the legend, but that they can't know. In \"John Carpenter's Vampires\" and it's sequel they establish they are creating a mythos, but it is still mythic. Blade makes the same same mistake we would see in Underworld, but at least they were not adapting something else and changing it to the nth degree. In fact you could almost say they did try to make a new story, but the comic book for Blade was well established before they ever tried to make a movie as a fantasy based vampire story (except for that one guy who dated black cat but that was really complicated).The biggest disappointment was the \"Blood God\" who went down faster than sororal cheerleader after 5 pint in a chug-fest.","\"Blade\" certainly delivers! A full-blooded action-packed gore galore! We got Wesley Snipes hacking up vampires to pieces with style and to a pumping hard trance- soundtrack. This is the kind of film that you end up watching if it comes out on TV, even if you already own a copy of it!Watch the \"Trivia\"-section to find out how they almost ended up screwing this good head-start of comic-book action heroes to silver screen (LL Cool J as Blade, eh!)And, believe or not, the sequel is even better! Wish I was this cool...","This film is total crap; the plot, the acting, the special effects, everything in this movie is terrible, even die-hard fans must recognize this movie is a shame.Why did you liked this?  I can't find nothing remarkable, interesting, well done or enjoyable in this movie, or is it the sunglasses? the lame action scenes? the stupid plot?? the music?? intelligence in the world is heading towards extinction2 out of 10","This is the kind of crap that Ed Wood would have made if he had a bigger budget.  The directing is inept, the dialogue insufferable, the acting forced and the effects lame.  This is what happens when no talent meets a big budget.","This movie is not only insulting, but it never gets above trash.  Not the kind of movie you want your children or grandchildren to watch.  We rated it a 1, but that was only because there was no number at IMDB any lower.","He kicks enough slow-mo ass in a long black coat to make Neo go \"Whoa.\" He rocks a vampire franchise slick and edgy enough to make RPatz whimper. And he brings enough spurting blood to the superhero blockbuster to make Kevin Feige faint. He's Blade - breakout star of the era when the term 'superhero film' was largely tantamount to 'campy garbage'. And he's a welcome shot of adrenaline to the current day multiplexes bursting at the seams with his more bloodless (ha) brethren. Respect.Director Stephen Norrington knows exactly how to stay on the fun side of campy, and goes right for the jugular in doing so, offering a slick, taut, and hugely entertaining bloodbath. Eschewing both a redundant origin story and some of the decade's more frantic action editing, Blade is marvellously paced, ticking along, shark-like, from exposition to action interlude and back with the hypnotic steadiness of blood pulsing through veins. It's hardly an ambitious plot (stop the pending vampocalypse, natch), but lent welcome life from Norrington and writer David S. Goyer's more inventively gruesome touches. Check out the sprinklers at the underground vampire nightclub dousing the raving crowd in blood in a gleefully macabre Carrie homage, amidst the film's inspired opening sequence, and it's impossible to deny you're in for a garishly amusing treat. Granted, some of the film's stylistic choices (Mark Isham's industrial-influenced soundtrack) age better than others (DP Theo van de Sande shooting the film like a streaky, jump-cutting '90s hip hop video is fairly jarring). But Norrington's flair for the grotesque helps punch up the monster horror fun. His prosthetic deformities and bubbling corpses playfully pilfer the best of Total Recall and Raiders of the Lost Ark, just as the classist in-fighting in the vampire ranks (born vampires sneering condescension at 'turned' bloodsuckers) lends odd nuance to the villainous MacGuffin, while a sterling climactic setpiece amidst a (practical set!) marble vampire temple is as sleekly Gothic as you could ask for. Blade may not reinvent the action wheel, but it certainly gives it a good, vigorous spin in the right direction. As the titular vampire hunter (no, not Abraham Lincoln), Wesley Snipes firmly establishes himself as one of the more reliable '90s badasses. His icy charisma is easily enough to carry the film, even if his attempts at infusing Blade's monolithic masculinity with humour through bursts of twitchy sassiness may take some adjusting to. Still, anyone who can sell a punchline as corny as \"Some motherf*ckers are always trying to ice-skate uphill\" with dignity intact is worth of accolades in my books. Supporting Snipes, N'Bushe Wright astutely refuses any damsel in distress clichés with a welcome, hardened charisma, at the cost of occasionally neglected to react appropriately to some of the film's more fearsome scenarios. Similarly, as the film's central antagonist, Stephen Dorff is perfectly oily, but his refusal to chew scenery in favour of a more subtle creepiness backfires somewhat, making him a suitable, but fairly forgettable foe. Finally, Kris Kristofferson lends his 'gruff mentor' archetype an appealingly indignant crustiness, bagging many of the film's better lines in the process. As the bodies hit the floor amidst the flurries of impressively executed, cathartically bloody action choreography, a realization sinks in: Blade, for all its leather-clad macho posturing, is a remarkably unpretentious film. It's fun, no- nonsense, and down and dirty, in the ways that only a moderately-budgeted franchise film with low expectations but high potential can be. You can practically see the seeds for 2016's Deadpool's rampant success being lain, albeit with only the tiniest winks of its fourth-wall-toppling zaniness. Still, nearly 20 years on, Blade remains an adeptly unapologetic slice of entertainment.
