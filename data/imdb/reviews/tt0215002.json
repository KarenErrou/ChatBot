{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190590/reviews"],"review-text":["We lived through the depression and related to some of the conditions portrayed. We have watched it perhaps a dozen times. Each time we see it we pick up on something we had missed because we were still laughing at, or discussing, an earlier scene or line. The entire film was a collection of photographically great faces. We are still asking ourselves whether the entire cast were professionals or whether some were individuals found on location. The film was rich with subtle tie-ins like the children tied together with twine, as the prisoners were connected by chains. We still think the cow may have been hit unintentionally. Fords of that era had mechanical brakes. The driver of the car may not have been accustomed the longer stopping distances required. The many allusions to Ulysses Odyssey inspired us to do an inter-net search. We found a modern text version and discovered more sly references. We appreciate blue grass and country music as originally American and found it thoroughly enjoyable, along with the authentic \"Go To Sleep Little Baby\" and \"Down from the Mountain.\" We were emotionally touched by this film because of our age, and find it totally entertaining every time we view it. We are still amazed that someone not of our generation could have captured the essence of that period of United States history.","Thank goodness for the Coen Brothers. Their success has brought them bigger budgets,but hasn't rid them of their creativity. I had planned on seeing another movie, but it was sold out so I went to this one instead. By the time it began, I had forgotten what movie I was there to see. I was surprised in more ways than one. This movie is hilarious, but they don't make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs. The writing is brilliant, and delivered with great skill by George Clooney (after this, nobody can say he's just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. It can be appreciated on many levels, whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was this clever. I've seen others I would describe as beautiful, intriguing, funny and charming, all of which also describe \"Oh Brother,\" but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end. You can feel that their journey is building up to something, but you can't tell what. And the Coen brothers do not fail us, the end is certainly not disappointing. It's surprising, and ties up all the loose ends neatly, without wearing the story out.","The Coen Brothers have truly outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts. Though it is based on \"The Odyssey,\" the ancient work of Homer, you do not have to have read \"The Odyssey\" to be able to follow the story. The brothers Coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights! The soundtrack is intrinsic to the film, indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper. Each character is wonderfully exploited and harkens back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness, texture and authenticity. George Clooney is magnificent as the grease haired Everett Ulysses McGill, a honest con on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing. O Brother, Where Art Thou is easily the best Coen film to date as well as Clooney's best effort. Clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of the dimwitted friend Delmar, while the film itself is deserving of a Best film nod.","Having seen most of the Coen Brothers previous films I expected something different and slighty off centre. OBWAT is certainly those things, but it also has a heart as big as..well..as big as Mississippi. It is one of the most plainly enjoyable movies to have come out in recent times, intelligent, well-crafted, clever and superbly acted.Characters are delivered in their myriad shades by a group of marvellous actors. George Clooney winning me over completely with his Clark Gable-ish looks and character. Having only ever seen him in Three Kings and his Thin Red Line cameo, I am now a fan. More comedy please George.John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson ably assist, especially Nelson. If ever \"The Simpsons\" is made into a movie then he must be a natural to play Cletus the slack-jawed yokel. I don't think there is a performance that falls short of excellent from the entire cast. My special favorite is Stephen Root as the blind Radio Station Man.Great old-timey music, a jiggy type dance by Clooney that I am trying to learn, and a feel of depression era southern US enhanced by sepia-like photography make this the best movie I've see  so far this century. The only drawback to the film is that it has almost sent me broke buying the soundtrack, the DVD and a DVD player to play it on....it's THAT good!","This was the best film I saw in the year 2000. The Cohen brothers have never let me down before, and they certainly didn't this time either.It's one of those rare movies these days - it's witty, intelligent and vastly entertaining. I left the cinema with a warmth in my heart. Of course, there's lot of Cohen stuff in there - odd characters and peculiar gadgets, well-developed plot and magic camerawork. But no Cohen film is resembling any other Cohen film, if you overlook the general quality of them, of course.The big surprise for me was that Clooney is so good. But the true master performance in this movie comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest of the cast is superb too.A film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolve it's story round rednecks and old time country music - dripping with wit and intelligence. Thats a very unlikely combination. But it's exactly what this picture is.","Not being a fan of the Coen Brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see the skepticism I took into the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something different. This time it was those zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) Coens doing \"their thing\" to one of the great works in literary history. Who would've ever thought Homer had this in mind? I don't know where this film is going to fit in the history books of Hollywood, but it will be in both mine and many others DVD or VHS library. It is one of those films that you can watch over and over. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and entertaining, with a couple of Gumpesque brushes with fame, great performances by Clooney, Turturro, Nelson, and a brief but hilarious Holly Hunter. Being born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the south, I wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this. They even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south. You are NOT doing anything better this weekend, go see this movie!","I have walked out of a Coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that I had to like it. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Still, I liked the film and now own a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics, sometimes I wasn't sure why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry, but nonetheless I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but upon further investigation, they were really just real people talking about real situations. That is why the man with the shovel ( or was it a broom ) was so side-splittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. And that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. (I own a copy of this film too) The Coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. But if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany, you will always find that in some strange way, they all ring true. That is what is quite exceptional about O Brother Where Art Thou? This is a film that is out there. I mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. I reviewed the film Shaft this past summer and in it I said that Shaft was an okay film that I have seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Coen Brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one.This film has everything in it from a jail break, crooked southern politicians, muses, references to what I can only assume are historical figures, riverside baptisms, bank robberies, violence towards animals, singing flocks of religious fanatics, KKK, lynch mobs and so on. There are obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey in here as well, but I wouldn't know that because I have never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spoof-like quality towards it makes the film that much better. Well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it, I can tell you that it is still an entertaining film. There were times when again, as is usual for a Coen film, I wasn't sure why I was entertained or laughing, but I was.This is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates. He has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape.I like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are Coen cronies. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in every Coen film. It's too bad they didn't find a place for Steve Buscemi but that is a different story all together. But back to Clooney. The man just has charisma. He is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is quite awesome and I really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character.Now after heaping all this praise on the film, let me just say this as well. I didn't really enjoy the film at first. I found it to be quite tedious and a little boring. There were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth. But then the film began to grow on me. It took a while but it did grow on me. I don't think this is their best film, but it is still a good one and I am giving it a 8.5. But the reason that I do recommend this film is for one reason only.Every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself, seen it, seen it, oh, seen it last year, that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film. Most films have been recycled in some form or another. Not the Coen's films. They have not been recycled and if they have I don't know about it. That is reason enough to see something that they put out. Originality counts for a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And that is not common in todays cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make films. Because you don't get vision like this in many films, so when you do, enjoy it!","The Coen Brothers have done it again. Three depression era convicts(George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson)escape a Mississippi chain gang and head off in search of buried treasure that will fund their new lives. Along the way, they sing on the radio and become much sought after stars as well as escapees. Great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson/introduction to bluegrass music.Clooney is outstanding as the fast talking, quick witted Ulysses Everett McGill. Holly Hunter plays his estranged wife. Turturro and Nelson are flawless stumblebums. Also in the cast are John Goodman and Charles Durning.Dan Tyminksi provides the singing voice for George Clooney on \"I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow\", the Soggy Bottom Boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, The Whites, John Hartford, The Cox Family and Gillian Welch. Toe tapping, knee slapping fun for the whole family. You'll be surprised with how relaxed and funny this movie is.","I was into the movie right away.  I've seen the other Coen movies, with the exception of Raising Arizona, and I've noticed that each of their movies has a color.  Fargo is gray/white, Lebowski is bright orange, and this movie is a pleasant yellow.The bright pleasant qualities of this movie start right away.  Soon the look is accompanied by the great, great music.  It's the old folk sound, the kind of music that was written during a time when music was enjoyed as a part of day to day life.  Enjoyed by everyone, chain-gangs, church choirs, and even prison escapees.Now, about the prison escapees.  I don't know what crime their characters could have possibly committed, as they are a very very friendly group of guys.  Clooney is fantastic, completely nailing his role.Go see this as soon as possible.  I believe that it can be enjoyed by anyone at some level.  For some reason, the theater I was in was full of old ladies and old men, and they loved it.You'll love it too, I promise.  I was compelled to get my hands on the soundtrack right away.","My husband received DVD of OBWAT for Christmas and it was the best gift we received! We watch it every time we need to laugh and so far we have viewed it 12 times!The scenery in this movie is beautiful and the music is outstanding!We also purchased the soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home when ever we need a pick me up and that too is daily!If anyone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie lovers this movie is it!The characters are hilarious , charming , and their facial expressions are too funny to describe!I have always been a fan of George Clooney but now I am also a fan of Tim Blake Nelson(Delmar ) and John Turturro (Pete)and am now looking for them in other movies! You gotta see this movie!!!","\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" is a beautiful movie with vivid, endearing characters. The storyline is broken neatly into episodes, apparently much like its source material. I haven't read Homer, so other than a few obvious nods to the classic author (the cyclops, for instance) I missed many of the parallels I'm told are there. It's difficult to pinpoint what makes this such a magnificent movie--probably because there are so many details that add up. The first thing that sold me, like so many others, was the music. The album sales alone stand as a testament to the quality of the soundtrack (I realize album sales don't always equal good music, but here they do). It feels like the movie was made during the Great Depression. If you watch movies made during the time, they were all \"feel good\" flics. Several reviewers here have drawn the savy comparison between OBWAT and \"It Happened One Night\", and specifically between Clooney's and Gable's performances. There are so many things that make this movie worth seeing. My only complaint that sticks is that it could so easily have been made PG. As it stands, it is one of the most harmless PG-13 films in a long time, and I wish the filmmakers hadn't opted to put in the extra \"dammits\" to elevate the movie into the more profitable bracket. Even the famous siren scene seemed tasteful, and sweetly seductive rather than racy. My point? This movie has the potential to make you smile.","I was looking forward to seeing this well reviewed movie.  Was I ever disappointed. Pros:  The actors did a great job with the material they had.  The ending was a lot of fun.  The music was fantastic. Cons:  The computer generated backdrops I found extremely irritating.  Ulysses matched his famous predecessor in bravado but not in brains or bravery.  I like characters that develop, that learn something, even in a comedy.  I've seen this kind of slapstick a thousand times; it did nothing original, even though it feebly alluded to literature.  Poor Homer. I give it a 2 out of 10, but only because of the marvellous Soggy-Bottom Boys.","That'Ok, the Coen path is still here, but i found this film very boring. Yes, the plans are beautiful, the actors are good, the music is OK, and sometimes it is funny. So there is something...but Fargo or the Big Lebowski were far better !!","Terrific production and a good comedic performance by George Clooney can't save curiously detached, occasionally clumsy quasi-comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen. Depression-era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain-gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune, and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process! The film meanders along but never builds any momentum. It does get a big boost from Clooney's charismatic, Gableesque mugging, and also from the art direction and T-Bone Burnett's lively music. Otherwise, the screenplay (by the Coens) is seriously lacking in humor and interest, supporting cameos by John Goodman and Holly Hunter fail to add any lift, and the second-half of the movie slides precariously into self-indulgence. ** from ****","***SPOILERS HEREIN***This movie starts out as a wonderfully cartoonish, big, brawling, slowpoke of a film.  With his hillbilly mannerisms, wall-eyed expressions, and perfect delivery, George Clooney gains redemption from the dreadful \"Batman and Robin\" and \"Solaris\".  \"I'm the paterfamilias,\" he proclaims when he sees his daughters.  Priceless.This film's defenders are those who find genius in things that are merely different.  For example, watching John Turturro yodel is startling, but then so is watching a homeless man urinate in a bottle; genius lies in context, not in eclecticism.  After listening to the wonderfully original music that permeates the score, the viewer is then treated to an audience singalong of \"You Are My Sunshine\", a song even more loathsome than \"Disco Duck\".The subplot about dueling politicans made no sense and contributed nothing to the storyline, other than as a convenient way to wrap up the ending. Is there any politician in the world who would storm into a crowded music hall and proclaim \"I am a member of a secret society\"?  It was a very weak and very lame way of disposing of the subplot villain.  Why would a man who was so careful and crafty with his campaign throw it all away by raising the ire of a roomfull of people?  So stupid, and made no sense.  This is very sloppy writing by the Coens.John Goodman is not a very good actor.  Although he was brilliant as Dan Connor on \"Roseanne\", he just doesn't have the range to play different characters.  He delivers his lines as Dan Connor would; little wonder then that the character is named Big Dan.  Fred Flintstone, Babe Ruth, King Ralph:  he plays the same character time after time, just like Morgan Freeman does.  However, he has a good screen presence, so it's understandable that he's a Coen brothers staple.  Holly Hunter, normally a firecracker, is ice-cold, and it's difficult to understand what Everett sees in her.  John Turturro is, as always, on the edge of mania, ready to fall off the deep end at any moment.  His howl of lust when he sees the women at the river is one of the funniest things he's ever done.  \"Looks like Pete's got the itch,\" Delmar deadpans in his philosophical way.My main problem with this movie is that there is no point to any of it. There is no goal and no storyline.  You can't identify with any of the characters, and it's difficult to accept Everett's longing to be back with his frigid wife.  Villians pop up right and left, but they are just temporary.  This film is like a series of half-finished thoughts, or half-remembered dreams, all leading up to a whole bunch of nothing.  The ending fizzles out like a dying candle, with Everett begging Penny to take him back.  Hmm, we're back where we started.With better writing, this could have been a great film.","Headline says it all really. I was a bit sceptical about going to see the film. Firstly the location was an 'Arty' cinema house and that sort of gave me the impression of an 'arty-farty' concept film, not made for the pleasure of the mass public, and a film to establish Clooney as more than a hearthrob. However, I read the review of the film, and according to the review the film would need to be watched more than once to be able to appreciate all the humour, as it came thick and fast. I think that comment was meant for the Dutch, originating from the UK I had no trouble with following the film.To my delight I was delighted with the film. Clooney played his part excellently as did the rest of the cast. The humour was great, at times very stereotypical, at times very subtle. Even though I had heard of the film it was not a huge box office success to my knowledge, which I think it deserved to be. Watch it and be surprised.","One of the finest pieces of story telling ever to hit celluloid.  The performances are so perfect and dead-on, and the nuances so subtle, that this movie defies description.  It is no wonder that the reviews you read run the gamut from \"piece of junk\", to \"superb\" to just plain confused. This is a must-see movie, and from there you're on your own, you have to decide for yourself.  Note, however, that this film follows its own course -- *loosely* based on Ulysses, and with its own symbolism, characters, and themes.  To spot them all you will need to watch carefully, think constantly, and, in all likelihood, see the film many times more than once. Not to worry, it improves with each viewing.","It is simply the best movie I have ever seen. The entire cast is superb. Excellent acting: not only George Clooney is fabulous as Everett, but so are the supporting actors (Tim Blake Nelson, John Turturro, John Goodman, Michael Badalucco, Holly Hunter, Wayne Duvall, Ray McKinnon etc.). The cinematography is brilliantly composed, magnificent pictures by Roger Deakins. The soundtrack is excellently chosen, no wonder it became a tremendous success. The story of Odyssey by Homer is paraphrased with care, it captivates you from the beginning to the end. The Coen brothers did a remarkable job, perhaps their best.All in all, it is a movie you have to see before you die.","About the discussion on the South, the rednecks and the hillbillies... Well, I am from the South: Argentina, near the South Pole to be exact. Is this southern enough? Seriously, some stories are universal. We have never been to Greece, nor lived the classic period of Homer, but he speaks to us today. So does Shakespeare and Dante. And stories from far unknown places also reach us, when told with sensibility, intelligence, humor, just like \"O Brother\". Besides, we all (the rest of the world) have our own hillbillies too! And our own depression era (ever heard of Argentina during year 2001?), our politicians and racism, our gentle souls just like Delmar and Tommy... I simply loved this movie, folks. Despite the subtitles, despite being on the other side of the world. (And please forgive my errors in English, I tried my best)PS: I believe nobody quoted this favorite phrase: when Delmar asks George Nelson what does he do for a living, while handling him the machine gun...","It's possible to make a smart movie about yokels. It's much more common to make a movie about Yokels that traffics in stupid yokel humor. Sadly, this is the latter. The Coen brothers have a very sophisticated understanding of American regionalism; which they blend with their unrefined, idiotic sense of humor to make some very awful movies. There comes a point in this movie when a viewer cuts his losses, as the scales tip from enthralling regionalism, to repellent juvenile low-humor; which probably wasn't even funny when it last appeared (vaudeville?). There isn't a gag in the Coen canon that rises above cornball. How they've managed to parlay this into a respectable career is confounding. Only the blue-grass and gospel songs save this turkey from being totally dead in the water. At the 30 minute mark, all the energy has wheezed out of it, forward momentum has completely expired, and you're left with over an hour with no perceptible value whatever.O bother...","This the Coen's weakest movie that I've seen. It's not really a movie in the traditional sense, more like a series of sketches strung together rather tenuously. What makes it work is the immense likability of the 3 leads and some genuinely hilarious moments. What doesn't is its length and the broken nature of the plot. You could leave during the screening, return in 10 minutes and it really wouldn't matter. Perhaps if I'd seen this before some the Coens' more accomplished recent films I wouldn't have felt so let down. The scenarios that our 3 protagonists find themselves in grow more surreal and ridiculous as the film progresses, and then, bizarrely, for the last half an hour it's extended into a kind of boring melodrama before fading out with a whimper.","Coen movies are easy to spot. They have that feel, the feel of originality and oddity, the crazy story lines and characters. Oh Brother has all that. The toned down dustiness of the movie feels less like a gimmick and more like it's supposed to be there, adding to the already thick Southern filter the movie's viewed through.The storyline is imaginative and totally impossible to predict. Giving credit to Homer is a bit silly, since the references to the Oddessy are made for fun and could easily have been discarded without changing the story.Characters are the usual bunch of misfits and crazies you expect. George Clooney does the role of his life-time. Remember the usual, smug, to a varying degree annoying Clooney you see in every movie he's in? Forget him. This is another person. His two companions are good support and fodder for his clever remarks and half-baked plans.Since this is set in the 30's South, there are tons of things to use as comedic elements. KKK, crooked politicians, religion, rednecks... amplify that with Coen's script-writing talent and you will laugh. A lot. There is even one of the trademark hallucination scenes, kind of.What more can you say than: \"Thank you Coens!\" I wont tell you to enjoy this movie. It's very simple. Just watch it!","Based on homer's Odyssey, we follow Everett Ulysses McGill and his companions Delmar and Pete as they escape from a chain gang so that McGill can get home to his family.  Along the way they must deal with sirens, a bible selling Cyclops, Babyface Nelson, a campaigning Governor, a Klan lynching party and a blind prophet.This is another of the Cohen brothers `different' projects - basically meaning that nothing will make a great deal of sense and won't always follow logical paths but will be full of imagination and energy.  The story won't always be gripping unless you know Ulysses' original adventure.  If you do then the story will be a joy, as you recognise the parallels between the two tales.  Even if you don't there is plenty to enjoy here, the story is so full of funny, imaginative and original characters that you can't help but be drawn in.  From Badalucco's Babyface Nelson (`Oh George, not the livestock'), to Durning's Pappy, everything is handled with such an edge of surrealism that it's captivating.Clooney has never been better and is truly excellent here with his eccentric hick character with a taste for hair cream.  Turturro is also excellent, but Nelson's childlike Delmar is the best character and a great performance. Hunter is as good as she usually is in Coen stuff and the support cast of Durning, Goodman, Badalucco etc are all great.  The music is fantastic, even if you not a fan of this type of music it still fits so totally with the mood of the film that it all works well together.This is a wonderful film - yet another from the Coens.  It has it's slow moments and the episodic nature of the story can sometimes give it an aimless feel, but overall this is significantly better than the sum of it's many great parts.","`Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?'  is ostensibly based on Homer's `The Odyssey,' but I have no reason to doubt the Coen Brothers when they say that they've never actually read it.  The film really has nothing to do with that epic poem other than the fact that the filmmakers throw plot elements from the original haphazardly into the mix every now and then.  Need a Cyclops? Dress John Goodman up in an eye patch to no point or purpose.  Sirens?  Have the main characters stumble across three beautiful women singing and washing clothes by a riverside, even though the scene seems totally contrived and arbitrary in the context of the story.  The Coen Brothers' lack of familiarity with the original is only too apparent.Actually, this is one of their worst films, no doubt about it  slow, arch, disjointed and heavy-handed in both its plotting and its humor.  The original `Odyssey' was an epic tale filled with adventure, high drama and great themes involving issues of courage, pride, commitment and love.  `Oh Brother' is none of these.  It is, in fact, silly, cramped and trivial.  The role of Ulysses has been assigned to George Clooney, as the leader of a trio of convicts who escape from a chain gang in the Depression Era Midwest.  As they roam the countryside, they encounter a myriad of bizarre, eccentric characters, some derived loosely from `The Odyssey' and some not.  None of it really works, partly due to the arbitrariness of the plotting and partly due to the fact that the humor is not very well executed.  In fact, most of the wit consists of having the actors overplay their facial expressions and accents.  As a result of these two factors, the strain never ceases to show.So are there any good things to be found in `Oh Brother'?  Well, the movie does look good, thanks to fine cinematography and art direction, which beautifully capture the look of the dusty rural countryside of the 1930's. And there is, of course, the occasional joke or idea that actually does work despite the fact that the film as a whole is a major disappointment. Perhaps, in the case of this particular Coen Brothers film, the title is inadvertently symbolic.","Another outstanding movie by the Coen Bros. While their style remains similar, there appeal can be hit and miss. This movie is right on target. This is a rare film that combines excellent casting, superb cinematography and well acted roles. And the best part about this movie is how much more your liking and respect for it grows the more you watch. Never before have I found myself so engrossed in a dialogue driven movie. Every viewing brings new laughs and exposes new subtleties that I was sure I caught. George Clooney firmly establishes himself capable of acting in a comedic role. Fans of Dennis Miller will certain appreciate the \"intelligent humor\" this movie provides and Coen Brother fans should have a new personal favorite. And a small suggestion from this end. If you didn't find it funny the first time, turn on the captions and grab a dictionary.
