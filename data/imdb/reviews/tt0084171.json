{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084171/reviews"],"review-text":["Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course. with all the cocaine references in this movie, it'd be panned as being way too politically incorrect today, as would Cheech and Chong. Too bad, because it is FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY!","This movie is blessed with an unusually high degree if silliness.  I giggled like a schoolgirl from beginning to end and was overjoyed to have found it to be available again on VHS.  No disrespect to the others who have posted their comments on this page, but they seem to be a little uptight, perhaps so much so that the whole idea of comedy escapes them.  I can envision such a pouter foolishly scowling for two solid hours while he critiques this flick.  Shame.  This movie is for people who like to have fun.  Lighten up.","This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is most glorious story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the bible. My parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it. The lady who gave the go ahead (friend of the family) was let go by the theater. I was 3 years old. I have burned through 4 copies on VHS and finally had it converted to DVD. It's beautiful.","So it's a little dated now, it's almost 30 yrs old. Amazingly enough I have this on BETA tape and it still plays just fine. If it came to DVD I'd snap it up in a heartbeat.The drug humor is not appreciated nowadays as it was back then. Then it wasn't as 'harmful'. Much like driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. I can remember my father crying he was laughing so hard watching this. I had coworkers in the 90's who'd seen it and I could bust them up by getting on the intercom and saying \"Iiiiiiiivvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy\".Great lines, great spoof of the original, and funny to me anyway even three decades later!","I first seen this movie in the early 80s and we used to have it on betamax. As we all know, betamax went the way of the 8-trak tape, sigh, it really had nice picture quality too. Anyways, I'm glad I found this movie again, I've been searching for it for more than 10 years! This movie falls into the category of movies like Airplane: continuous jokes, oneliners, funny actions (bodylanguage). Mark Blankfield is absolutely hilarious. His transformation from the shy Dr. Daniel Jekyll into the sex-crazed partyanimal Mr. Hyde is unforgettable, complete with goldtooth, chesthair and goldchains. The part I loved best was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to Madam Woo Woo's. Totally psychedelic experience without the drugs! If you need laugh therapy this is the movie to do it. When I first seen it, I had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly laughing. This is a movie I could watch over and over again. I highly recommend it.","alot of people will not enjoy this movie, but it is not due to a lack of humor. it is filled with drug/sex jokes and references which would turn off lots of conservative minded viewers but if theses things dont bother you, this movie is hilarious. it is reminiscent of airplane (anything zucker) but also has elements of python-style surrealisim. the transformation scene, complete with erection and jewelry is classic and his colleague's (thomerson's) gradual breakdown/outing are priceless. blankfield's hyde is classic and should have had him working for years. in summary, how can you not like a villan who, when confronted with a woman screaming \"RAPE!\" responds \"later, if there's time\"","This is one of those rare comedies where try as you might, you can't help but giggle, chortle, guffaw and yes, even laugh out loud. The lead actor's performance as Hyde is pure manic genius. See if you can keep a straight face when he does his transformation. Good luck. :) On the downside there are times when the movie does bog down. It seemed longer than its 90 minutes.","I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion. I hope some producer or director can get into the idea and bring us new comedy to our screens. we are needing a good insurgence of comedy to keep our level of laughter higher than ever before. A good Comedy FIX.","Who ARE the people that star in this thing? Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years. Oh... and the \"Busty Nurse\" is Cassandra Peterson, who went on to become Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. If you liked the Mel Brooks classic movies (Blazing Saddles, etc.), I suspect you'd like this one.Damn shame you can't get it on DVD anywhere.It's available on DVD now !!!!! Good thing DVDs don't wear out from use !!!!!","So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? \"The Villain\" and this one could top the list.My husband says that \"Jekyll and Hyde Together Again\" is one of those movies that if \"you've been there and done that\" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate. To say that the film doesn't follow the book would be true, but then a lot of really good films take liberties with the published word also. I recommend this movie to all the old \"stoners\" among us. We may be smarter now, but we will still recognize and laugh at many folks we knew (ourselves?) back in the old days.","A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... Classic lines such as (parapharsed) \"I've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You're a nurse, what can you give me for it?\" Nurse replies \"all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring...\" Great sound track.The classic \"Hyde's got nothing to hide\". Stays surprisingly close to the original plot - not that the original stays in the way of a joke..... Haven't met anyone with an IQ over 115 that doesn't find it hysterical.","During the 1980's we all knew, if you saw an item twisted into a knot on a movie-poster, the film would invariably fall into the slapstick category that started with Airplane\". In this case we are greeted by a twisted syringe.\"Jeckyll and Hyde  Together Again\" falls in the same vein as \"Airplane\", \"Hot Shots\" or \"Top Secret\" and even though it does not reach those 'high' standards, the jokes are coming hard and fast and relentless, punching above and below the belt, not leaving the audience much time to find many flaws.Bess Armstrong and Krista Errickson are both cute as a button, Tim Thomerson is reliable as ever, it's a joy to watch Michael McGuire chew his scenes and do look out for 'guest-appearances' by Liz Sheridan, Lin Shaye as sex-starved nurse and George Chakiris, playing (as he often does) himself.But the honourable Oscar  (carved out of chewing gum and jelly beans) must go to Mark Blankfield, one of the shamefully neglected comedians of his time. His hyper-nervous Daniel Jeckyll-persona makes one want to reach for the remote, playing his scenes back in slow-motion, ever in danger adopting the characters quirks and ticks. He's only upstaged by Blankfield as Mr. Hyde who, had the movie been better promoted and more successful, could have ended a cinematic cult-figure. Few comedians have gone as over the top as Blankfield and why we haven't seen more of him on the big-screen will probably remain one of Hollywood's eternal secrets.Granted, Jerry Belson, though a veteran of light comedy himself, is no Jim Abrahams or David Zucker. The production has the air of television about it, never as easy or elegant as above mentioned slapstick-classics but compensates with pure self-confidence.If you're a fan of the \"Airplane\"-genre of slapstick, I recommend this blindly and if you've grown up with the newer generation ala \"Epic Movie\", I recommend this because it comes from a time where slapstick still meant quality and hard work. They just don't make them like they used to  9 points out of 10 points - slapstick-points, that is.","Better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of \"Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex\" to the Mel Brooks of \"The Producers\", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong. Watch it, listen carefully because some of the jokes go by really quickly, and remember a time when comedy was allowed to be offensively hilarious.","Coming from the \"druggie\" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it I can't remember but a few things. I would have to say the funniest part was when Dr. Jekyll dozed off on his lab table and inhaled the straw, while snoring, then snorted up the powdered drug he had invented. Funniest thing I'd ever seen in a movie.","I have seen this movie several times and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies such as the Airplane or Hotshot series. The lead actor does an excellent performance showing great comedy talent.","What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde. The one scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: \"how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter.\" Jekyll replies, \"but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation.\"Lanyon replies back, \"oh. Well in that case fu** your brains out!!!\"","Some said that this was a nose candy glorification flick, but short of the original Dr. Hyde's concoction, no drug has yet been developed that can provide THIS effect. If Viagra was the slime mold stage, that white sparkling powder is the Stephen Hawking evolutionary rung (or at least the pharmacist idiot savant branch). This reality show is really about the sacred cows of medicine, seen as was the emperor without clothes. Few of us want to question the health field; both because most of us would not have lived to our current age had we been born before \"modern medicine\", and because our subconscious hopes that we will continue to live on if we have faith in the helping professions. So the geniuses who produced this movie made jokes out of those Calcutta Bessy's, giving us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern institution of medicine. The timing was right, and many were able to see the business side of the healing companies behind the curtain of Oz. A decade before, when George C. Scott ranted through the movie The Hospital, my wife and I were sitting in the packed premiere in Oklahoma City. Just as in Jekyll & Hyde's remake, we were almost unable to keep from falling out of our seat, and laughed and howled uncontrollably for the duration. The hundreds of other audience members were deadly silent. They were shocked that doctors, nurses, & the hospital institution were being mocked. It was as if the Pope, Billy Graham, and Gandhi were were sitting in the Animal House, beer stained tee shirts and all, competing to see who could tell the funniest God knock-knock jokes between belches. Had The Hospital been a slapstick comedy rather than a satire, they might have been able to see what was being shown to them. Unfortunately they were like Republicans at a screening of Michael Moore's 9/11. Perhaps smaller golden parachutes would have been given to the corrupt medical corporation leaders, health insurance companies would have had a tougher time denying medical care, and health providers would have been demystified earlier, if George C. Scott had tap danced in a tutu while delivering his terrible truths. But--forget everything I just said. Watch the movie, be consciously made as happy and joyful and full of laughter as the best ever Saturday Night Live skit, and let the subconscious soak in the documentary of the underlying reality. Just don't blame me when \"Got to Got to Got to Got to\" becomes one of your sayings, or when \"Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide\" occupies that portion of your brain now paralyzed by \"Its a Small World After All\". Or when you start calling your local hospital Our Lady of Pain and Suffering instead of Our Lady of Eternal Construction. Even Oklahomans were changing their favorite terrible boss wishbone winner entreaty from \"Piss on him and leave him for dead\", to \"Body in a pit, you in it.....\" The smell of death...it's gone! Chicken sushi! Mary. MARY. MARYEEEEEEEEEEEEE!","I remember \"Fridays\": Marc and Melanie Chartoff, Mike Richardson, a slew of funny folks coming on after midnight to rock the house! Way funnier than Sat Night Live! Marc was a pharmacist who constantly took just ANY drug within reach and was so spastic and funny. This movie has been a favorite of mine since it came out, and I got a copy on DVD recently! The last time I saw Marc was on an episode of NYPD Blue, he was a crazy homeless guy who built some metal sculpture on public property.I loved seeing Cassandra Pederson (Elvira, Mistress of the Dark!) as the hot Nurse...loved her funny movie too! (favorite supporting actor...\"Gonk\" LOL!) Saw her on Counting Cars recently.Tim is a classic actor, he does everything and does it well!Keep a copy of this classic, like Bladerunner it will grow over time in status...and we are all soo cool 'cause we knew the Comic Greatness contained in this movie way back when! *Baaaabe!*","I was 10 years old in 1982. This movie was top-notch in it's genre for it's time era and a great comedy classic. I can still laugh at this film after all these years because Mark Blankfield really rocked this comedy-horror and he's \"gotta, gotta get the antidote\" LOL! This is a crazy, non-sense type of a comedy. Maybe you would have to have lived in the time period this film was made to laugh hard at the movie. Or maybe you would have to learn to let yourself go in order to appreciate this type of a bizarre comedy movie. Whatever it is, the film rating is entirely to low on IMDb for such a great comedy classic.If you liked comedy-horror films like \"Young Frankenstein\", \"Dracula, Dead and Loving It\" or \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" then you may enjoy this movie too.9/10","Robert Louis Stevenson has brought the character of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde years ago in a book. Hollywood brought in on film in the early 1930's. Now there's this schlocky, yet upbeat version of the novel, with a very hip Hyde. Here you have a California surgeon name Dr. Daniel Jekyll (Mark Blankfield) who is contrite, hard-working, yet very uptight. Who works for a guy that harries him a lot, and a daughter who very understanding. Jekyll wants to give up surgery, and start to do research work to tap in on the human animalistic side. He would create this powder which has been worked on many times. Its appearance looks like dope, and when he dozes off, he unwittingly snorts it. The results, he becomes this wild, hip, sex-craving, madman name Hyde. Unlike the one in Stevenson's story, he's more hairy, than hideous. Still crude and rude though. Hyde, goes after a woman name Ivy(Kris Errickson), who Jekyll once helped. It's not a surprise when Hyde return to England where the original Hyde got created at. Both women confronted Jekyll/Hyde, and rather than fight for him.... What am I saying? Watch it for yourself, and you will know the answer for sure. Corny and outrageous, this movie is fun all the way. 3 out of 5 stars","In the tradition of those outrageously silly comedy spoofs; \"Jekyll and Hyde Together Again\" seemed to fall amongst the cracks which are rather disappointing because this item has its fair share of laughs and sexual innuendo. Like most of its ilk, it can be hit or miss with its surgically placed gags but it's a lot of wacky fun to watch because of Mark Blankfield's comic performance as the straight-laced Jekyll and maniacally tripped-out Hyde. Especially the risible transformation scenes and his off-the-rocker interactions. Still he has great support in the shape of Tim Thomerson, Michael McGuire, Bess Armstrong, Krista Errickson and bit part for Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira as a busty nurse. Judging by its title, it's easy to guess how the premise will play out. Yep this is a bastardised version of Robert Louis Steven's story \"The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde\", which sees the medical practice and hipster scene coming together where Dr. Jekyll struggles to harness this animal instinct in to descent thanks to the temptation of a certain white magic powder. This time it's mostly set in America, but heads to the story's basis country of origin England in the latter half. There it plays around with its source material and gives a wink to the original author. What the script snorts up is purely madcap, where one minute it would be dry then suddenly quite low-brow and then plain goofy. The dialogs are just madness. A pleasurably comical low-budget b-grade cult comedy spoof.\"Only if the animal in man could be released.\"","I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable.The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, \"Siskel & Ebert\".) But, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate. I often find myself quoting lines (or, singing, \"I've Got Nothing to Hide\") and, from time to time, completely describe a scene which matches some conversation. There are, at least, six scenes which are among my all time favorite comedy bits.Viewers with no history of cocaine use may miss a lot of gags.\"Here, take it.\" * Visual of driving while waving butt out the window.* \"I said, 'Is this seat taken?'\" \"Nice Burn!\" Visual of chaps, headdress, jockstrap, & swim fins. * \"Yeah. I'm right handed.\" * \"Me! Me!\" says the woman trying to sell 'nads. * \"Bernie's going to love these.\" * \"That's my feet, Jack.\" says the black feet. * \"Why should we tell you?\"... \"SHE'S AT THE SUPERMARKET!\" * \"Ivy!\" on supermarket PA. * Loading whole shopping cart into ambulance. * etc.","In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was \"The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks\". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the \"Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide\" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit. Mark Blankfield reminds one of Gene Wilder in some ways. Bess Armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time.","\"Pearl Harbor, buddy.\" This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one that goes for silliness, much like \"Dumb and Dumber\", \"Airplane\" and \"Wet Hot American Summer\" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece! When watching this, you will easily find over 20 quotes from it that you will find yourself quoting after-wards... and after to watch it again you'll find even more!","i just wanted to say this movie is a funny classic. my 23 year old girlfriend never saw or heard of it and she found it to be funny. if the younger crowd likes it. it must be good. IMDb does not show it but this movie is on DVD avail thru amazon. its also only ten bucks. what a deal. watching it brought back those old laughs from the past and after it was over. we wanted to watch it again.i am a movie collector with over 1000 titles on my shelf and this is one that needed to be there. either way there are a lot of funny lines and characters in it as well as its drug based humor is good for anyone interested in cheech and chong or other funny classics of the 70's + 80's."],"review-user":["bluedevil70","Pigmata","hamnchkn","Talos_Valheru","Siggy-WA","munkeyfuk","mxb2001","Merlin4646","GentleKnight1","becklet","mot1mot","t_atzmueller","sutungpo","gypsyccw","scahalan","spfi","dcsmith-3","sandemon-38504","Rainey-Dawn","GOWBTW","lost-in-limbo","BeauEvil","fergusrl2007","Girolahozz","PONYBOY42073"],"review-date":["22 February 2006","12 August 2001","5 June 2006","17 August 2006","15 April 2002","28 February 2004","20 April 2003","29 April 2006","6 August 2006","3 June 2005","1 April 2004","25 October 2011","27 July 2008","21 June 2006","24 March 1999","31 January 2002","12 October 2005","14 October 2015","29 June 2014","27 August 2012","24 July 2011","16 January 2010","14 October 2009","7 February 2009","23 September 2008"],"review-rating":["10","10","8","10","9","10","8","8","10","9","8","10","8","10","10","9","8","7","9","8"],"review-title":[" Wrong, wrong, wrong!\n"," This movie is exquisitly silly and many missed the point.\n"," a fun factoid about the nurse with gonzagas\n"," Loved it!\n"," an absolute must see, continuous laughs\n"," not for everyone but...\n"," Funny\n"," Jekyl and Hyde together again Genuinely Funny\n"," Bawdy humor in a B movie that deserves more popularity\n"," So it's not an award winner......\n"," If you don't get it - you're lame.....\n"," If you cannot laugh about \"chicken sushi\", you're probably no slapstick-fan\n"," Worth seeing\n"," Very funny first time around\n"," Excellent spoof\n"," I laughed until I almost fell out of my chair\n"," Hidden in Hyde: in 1982 it was safer to criticize drugs than medicine\n"," I have loved Marc since \"Fridays\".\n"," Gotta Gotta Get The Antidote!\n"," Some guys have all the luck!\n"," \"Don't touch me you dirty hippie!\"\n"," WAY overlooked \"B\" gem.\n"," The Music\n"," SPOILER*** Chicken sushi\n"," its on DVD\n"]}
