{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067219/reviews"],"review-text":["This zany film rivals the Ghost and Mr. Chicken as one of Don Knott's finest film performances. Knotts is an accountant for a Podunk city hall that is good for swindling the citizens. They fire the \"three competent bookkeepers and keep the dumb one\" (Knotts of course is the dumb one). When his garbage collecting cohort accidentally empties the wrong trash can, Knotts finds himself wrapped up in a bizarre trap set by the city council for him. Funny moments in the movie include the Bowling Alley Restroom scene, and the cemetery scene is absolutely hilarious. Typical Knotts, the nervous ninny act is well used, and as usual he is surrounded by lots of crazy character actors from the sixties. Such actors as Frank Welker, and Pitt Herbert add to the mayhem. As one may expect Knotts's armed with a big car, a pretty girl, and no real clue of what he's doing. Fun for anyone, especially nostalgia buffs, but just about anyone will love it.","...it is still entertaining and interesting. Many people have complained that this is Don on autopilot. Nothing could be further from the truth. Granted, the FILMMAKERS were on autopilot. The overt kiddie flick tone of \"Figg\" was obviously an attempt to counter the perceived flack the studio got from the mild sexual overtones of Knotts'previous film, the classic \"The Love God?\". And \"Figg\" is a goofy, childish film in many ways--similar to the worst of Disney's live action romps like \"Herbie Goes Bannanas\" or \"The Million Dollar Duck.\".But the film does do one thing rightit changes up the standard Don Knotts film character. As everyone notes, the standard character in Knotts' five classic Universal flicks is basically Barney Fife. But it's more complex than that. In the first four films, the Knotts character was invariably a naïf loser who is put upon, becomes an undeserved success, gets a big head, is brought down again, and eventually perseveres. Through it all, however, he is always a nice guy. This, however, is only half of the Fife persona. The other half is what I like to call the \"Dick Barney,\" as in \"The Barney Who Acts Like a Dick.\" This angrier Barn is evident in the \"Andy Griffith\" episodes in which Barney is in charge of Gomer or Goober. Seeing them as inferiors, the inferiority-complex riddled Barney is always compelled to order them around, yell at them, and call them stupidin other words, to just treat them like a dick. This kind of interaction was the source of many hilarious \"slow burn\" Barney tantrums.The Knotts we see in \"Figg\" is not the Nice Barney, it is definitely the Dick Barney. So, even though the plot of \"Figg\" is pretty much a cookie-cutter slice of the standard Knott's formula, the lead character is a definite change for the film series. The substitute Gomer in \"Figg\" is Knott's best friend Prentiss, played by voice artist Frank Welker. And Prentiss makes Gomer look like a freakin' genius (in fact Welker's performance is so over the top childlike that he seems literally retardedbut no one really seems to notice). Knotts' Figg character verbally rails on Prentiss without mercy, eyes popping, veins bulging, his whole body vibrating with rage. IT IS A RIOT TO BEHOLD!So, even though the script, supporting cast, and direction of \"Figg\" were all substandard, Knotts himself did at least try to give us something different instead of simply rehashing the same ole same ole. Gotta give him credit for that!","HOW TO FRAME A FIGG is a vintage Don Knotts-frenetic, farcical comedy, and features him at the top of his form as the hysterical, cat-on-hot-tin-roof nervous, persecuted civil servant Hollis Figg.  What a lot of people may not recognise is that they are also seeing someone else in a rare character appearance:  Figg's slightly dim-bulb sidekick, Prentiss Gates, who is played convincingly by Frank Welker.  Welker, whose face is relatively unknown, has nonetheless a voice that is very well known indeed:  He is heard in literally bazillions of films, TV series, and cartoons.  You have watched but few shows in recent years, including \"The Simpsons\", that did not feature Frank Welker's remarkable ability to mimic animal sounds and other weird aural effects.","Don Knotts is Hollis Figg, the dumbest bookkeeper in town. When the city fathers buy a second-hand computer to cover up their financial shenanigans...It was nice to see Yvonne Craig as a character other than Batgirl, even if she was merely the evil temptress. And Dick Warlock on stunts? Wish i knew exactly what he did, because Mr. Warlock is someone I admire for all the wrong reasons.The film as a whole is good -- it is funny, silly and has some dumb moments (and I use \"dumb\" in the nicest way possible). I would not go so far as to call it a \"good\" film, but it is enjoyable... and I do love me some Don Knotts.","\"How to Frame a Figg\" was the last of the Universal film vehicles for comedy star Don Knotts, and it definitely yields lesser results, although it's still good for some laughs. Knotts plays Hollis A. Figg, a none too bright accountant at City Hall, who is turned into a patsy for a troupe of crooked politicians. Among them are Kermit Sanderson (Joe Flynn), the mayor (Edward Andrews), and the towns' elderly bigwig, Charley Spaulding (Parker Fennelly). One method employed by our comedic villains is to reward Figg with a do nothing job and a smoking hot secretary (Yvonne \"Batgirl\" Craig).Knotts is in typically fine form, even if he's had better material before and after this one. He still knows how to do a great comedic over reaction. Here, his flamboyant style is complemented by a young co-star, and it is here that \"How to Frame a Figg\" has its greatest value: a rare substantial on screen appearance by the legendary voice over artist Frank Welker, a guy whom most people have to have heard in SOMETHING. He's had tons of credits over the last several decades. He's good as a cheerful, endearingly annoying type. It also helps Figg look smarter by having a sidekick who's even more dense (and who is prone to constantly reference classic movie moments).The very fine supporting cast helps matters a lot. Elaine Joyce is appealing as a waitress and love interest for our hero. Craig is tantalizingly sexy as the temptress with lots of \"doting uncles\". Fennelly is a hoot as the irascible ringleader who refers to his underlings as \"poop heads\". (This IS rated G.)Like a lot of comedies, it can get pretty silly and tiresome at times, but it's still impossible to truly dislike.Directed by Knotts' frequent co-conspirator Alan Rafkin (\"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken\", \"The Shakiest Gun in the West\"), with appropriately goofy music by Vic Mizzy. Knotts shares story credit with Edward Montagne.Six out of 10.","If folks were really this stupid I could be the SRW - Supreme Ruler of the World. In this one Knotts plays a dimwitted bean counter for some little jerk water town run by a group of crooked simpletons only slightly brighter than he is. When things appear a bit shaky for the crooks they go for a frame-up of the  patsy Figg. Plenty of laughs as Knotts does his usual bumbling, stumbling act. I especially appreciated the extension cord scene; asininity at it's highest level.","This outing of Knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever, Frank Welker. Welker makes the film. Knotts and Welker compete for the laughs and both receive plenty. Knotts works for a small \"no where\" town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials. When things go wrong the city fathers, allow Knotts to take the fall. Frank Welker's character befriends Knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and Knott's good name. This film shows the usual Knott's scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film. This may have been Knotts' last good outing. When you have an extra 90 minutes, get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon, Don Knotts.","I remember seeing the beginning of this movie-during the late '80s or early '90s, I can't remember which-on an independent station (well, it was a Fox one, actually) when I lived in Jacksonville, FL. It looked funny enough but for some reason, I didn't bother to watch the whole thing. So now I just did that on Netflix DVD. My verdict: I found most of it pretty hilarious what with Don Knotts' usual persona of a nervous, easily upset, reluctant hero. Among the funny supporting cast: Frank Welker as Knotts' best friend, Elaine Joyce as his sweet girlfriend, Edward Andrews as the corrupt mayor, Joe Flynn as the mayor's associate, Parker Fennelly as the cantankerous boss of the latter two, and Yvonne Craig as Knotts' \"secretary\". Both Ms. Joyce and Ms. Craig are sexy in their own way here though I have to admit that Ms. Craig is the more alluring one every time she shows up. I had a real good time watching this one! So on that note, I recommend How to Frame a Figg.","I loved all the other Don Knotts movies, but I never heard much about \"How To Frame A Fig\" and now I know why: I can't think of anyone who would find it enjoyable. This movie seems to appeal to 9 or 10 year olds, but even most of them would give this a thumbs down. At best there are brief moments of mild amusement, mostly from Don Knotts playing the same nervous, underdog persona that made him famous.After the movie finally finished I was curious if my teenager could pick up on this movie's fatal flaw. We were in complete agreement: the Prentiss Gates sidekick character was even dumber than the Don Knotts character.Be happy that Mr. Limpet, Reluctant Astronaut, Shakiest Gun and Mr. Chicken movies are around to enjoy."],"review-user":["bakerd1-1","curtis-8","sigil","gavin6942","Hey_Sweden","helpless_dancer","cutshall0","tavm","olusjay"],"review-date":["4 November 2006","23 August 2006","31 October 1998","5 March 2012","15 April 2017","6 September 2001","19 April 2006","3 December 2014","26 October 2007"],"review-rating":["9","5","6","6","7","8","7","3"],"review-title":[" Don Knotts at his finest\n"," Lesser of Knotts' Classics--but...\n"," Don Knotts teams with an unrecognised well-known.\n"," Average Slapstick Film -- Great For Knotts Fans\n"," Message received and noted.\n"," Stupidity knows no bounds\n"," How to Frame a Fig\n"," How to Frame a Figg is a funny enough Don Knotts comedy\n"," This movie was painful to watch\n"]}
