{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275527/reviews"],"review-text":["This film is a sleeper because Rod Steiger's is the only big name in the credits.  Yet, all of the supporting actors fit well with his character. It was fitting that in his last film, Rod Steiger reminded us once more of his inventive power as an actor.  He portrayed a grandfather's impulsiveness, stubbornness, and acceptance of the end of life in a characteristically individual and convincing performance.  Because his character was close to death, the story brings us closer to the most precious things granted to us: the privilege of life, relationships with family members, and the empathy of those who care for us.  His search together with his grand daughter for one of his sons provided enough suspense to keep me waiting, expecting a highly-charged climax such as the meeting of two long-separated elderly lovers who were also on the cusp of death in \"Forever Young.\"  I wondered how the meeting would be staged and how tightly my emotions would be wound by the time he and his granddaughter reached the end of his quest.  I was delighted to find that the story brought more than I expected.  The delightfully satisfying climax brought for me a greater appreciation of the value of the precious gifts of life, love, and family that are enjoyed today by me and by all of us.","This movie had great casting and a fun heart-warming storyline. The actress that played Biddy did a superb job along side such a renowned actor in Rod Steiger. It shouldn't be too long before we'll be seeing her in a lead role in a big-time production. Overall, A Month of Sundays was both enjoyable and a great movie for the family to see!!","Rod Steiger still has that legendary genius brewing within him as he takes on the role of Charley McCabe in this heart-felt story about the mistakes we make and the redemption behind them.  Corina Marie (Biddy McCabe), who has a brewing ability of her own, stands out as McCabe's granddaughter and matches Rod Steiger scene for scene.  Her performance shines through in this film as she gives an honest and touching performance. This film has moments anyone could relate to and scores big with the idea that when it comes to family....you can forgive.  Rod Steiger gives a performance that intrigues, moves and touches anyone who has loved and lost, fought and won.  I recommend this film to all ages.","I recently rented the tear jerk drama \"A Month Of Sundays.\" I didn't know what to expect, but since I'm Rod Steiger's greatest fan I had to see it. The storyline seemed slightly contrived, but seeing a new-comber so talented (Corina Marie) made it all worthwhile. Rod did a wonderful job, as well as Michael Pare and Jamie Farr. It was a pleasant surprise to see those talents acting so well in a film that would have crumbled without Rod, Michael, Jamie, and especially Corina. I don't recall this playing in theaters, but I did stumble across it at Blockbuster. It's worth checking out, and Corina Marie if you read this... Where have you been????? You're probably a star on Broadway by now, or London's \"West End.\" Either way I'm sure you're successful, as your ability shines like no young star I've seen since a young Jodie Foster!!!!!!!!","A younger generation will be introduced to veteran actor, Rod Stieger in this film. Rod Stieger's performances as the ailing grandfather was excellent, as was the performance of Corina Marie, the actress who played his granddaughter Biddie. These two actors, the focal points of the film, stand out amid a sea of less impressive characters and actors. They both show a great range of emotion, humor among tragedy, and chemistry with each other as actors. The story is told in a unique fashion using flashback and dream sequences. This is a more intelligent family film that I would recommend to families who tire of watching an endless barrage of cookie-cutter films with \"no brainer\" plots.","A wonderful film - a charming, quirky family story. A cross-country journey filled with lots of interesting, oddball stops along the way (& several very cool cameos). Great cast led by Rod Steiger carries the film along and leads to a surprise ending. Well directed & shot - a really nice movie.","A Month of Sundays is a family oriented affair.  Corina Marie (Biddy) shines in this heart warming production. In her first starring role she matches Steiger's ability on screen as the loving and dedicated granddaughter Biddy. Her performance is genuine and heartfelt.  The cameo's are funny and provide humor to the seriousness of the film.","I loved this film.  A must see for any Rod Steiger fan.  Producer Suzanne DeLaurentiis and Director Stewart Raffill have brought us a true family film that touches the soul.  An incredibly well put together movie with a beautiful soundtrack.","This is truly one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life.  Rod Steiger who stars as the ornery grandfather, Charlie, is in full overacting mode hoping that the more flashy he is, the better his performance (Cue buzzer sound).  Rod Steiger is one of the last true film legends and to see him in this film (although End of Days is the 2nd worst film I've ever seen) is really heartbreaking.  From the bad storyline to the nonexistent direction, it becomes abudantly clear that the only reason this film was made was that the producer's last name ended in DeLaurentis.  The only good thing about this film is that it is so bad, it's truly hysterical.  Look for the flashback scene where Rod where's a Jor-El wig from Superman and a big black porno mustache.  One only hopes that his follow up film, I Believe in America, from Uber-producer Kevin Arbouet will redeem him and leave a good taste in everyone's mouths."],"review-user":["ipw","fayb8","marrajayd","Berzuercher","mc411","paris14","CTO","butrnip2","lillythai"],"review-date":["17 August 2002","16 June 2002","29 May 2002","28 May 2007","7 June 2002","8 December 2001","1 June 2002","19 December 2001","11 April 2002"],"review-rating":["8","10","10","1"],"review-title":[" Perhaps no one understands the meaning of life better than one who is about to leave it.\n"," honest and trustworthy\n"," A movie that actually has something to say about what it means to be family..\n"," Biddy is amazing!!!!\n"," Family Film with an unique twist...\n"," Thoroughly enjoyed the film!\n"," Family Oriented\n"," Heart-warming, soul fulfilling\n"," What happened, Rod Steiger?\n"]}
