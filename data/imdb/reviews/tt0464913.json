{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464913/reviews"],"review-text":["I just saw this film last night, and I have to say that I loved every minute. If taken in the spirit of a parody of Bond-esquire films, it's truly superior. The true comedy of the film is in its blatant disregard for political correctness. The misogyny, cultural insensitivity, and almost laughable macho-ism of the films of this genre are used for major comic effect. It also calls the illogic and formulaic elements to task, with Agent OSS 117 constantly learning difficult things insanely quick (such as Arabic and how to play a traditional instrument) while missing some pathetically obvious clues. Some of the lines from the film left me laughing for hours after the movie was finished...and I have to say I have learned some...interesting...French vocabulary that would probably have my Professors quite exasperated with me were I to use. All in all, I thought this film excellent. Intensely funny and the first film I've ever seen that truly parodies all aspects of the spy film.","Jean Dujardin gets Connery's mannerisms down pat: the adjusting the cuff links when entering a club as all the women turn to admire him, the nonchalant straightening and smoothing down of the tie, the swaggering, steely gait. It's uncanny, and you come to realise just how much of Bond in the Sixties was Connery's creation and not really Ian Fleming's character. The cinematography is a nod to those early films, the movie takes off From Russia With Love and Thunderball mainly. The main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is, not just in terms of sexism but nationalism and colonialism, and how he puts noses out of joint when he is sent to Egypt. It's not perfect - about 20 mins in it seems a one-joke movie and bits of it remind one of spoofs of the day, of which there were plenty. Morcecambe and Wise's The Intelligence Men had suspect-looking men in fez's following their heroes around too, and that's going back a bit. Unlike Sellers' Clouseau or Baron Cohen's Borat, Dujardin doesn't give his character that layer of realness or genuine pathos - he is too busy perfecting his Connery mannerisms. It doesn't do enough with the credits or a big song, and there's no funny or serious villain, like Mike Myers' Dr Evil or Ricardo Montalban's Naked Gun nemesis, for the hero to go up against.But the scene where OSS117 wakes up in Cairo one morning had me laughing out loud in the three-quarters empty cinema, and the whole thing looks wonderful, plus you'll never get a chance to see Operation Kid Brother on the screen, and the women are ace crumpet, really hot. It's a Bond spoof without falling into the mad scientist/Ken Adam sets or funny gadgets routine. Throughly recommended.","This is probably one of the best French movies I had seen in a very long time! This \"pastiche\" or parody of spy movies is very well made and is going to make you laugh from the beginning to the end. Some references to today's world are very subtle. The whole Maroccan context of the movie is to be understood in light of today's French culture/environment. That said, all the jokes and - seemingly - shocking remarks that could have been understood as such because of this context, are permitted and accepted because this is a parody. I was told by my sisters who had already seen this movie that I should go too and assured me that I was going to have a great time, and indeed I had! If you liked the old 007 movies with Sean Connery and also like movies like Airplane or Hot Shots, you will be delighted. I just hope this movie is released on DVD in the US... Wait and see.","OSS: 117 (2006)I wish for a couple hours I was French, because I'm sure there were twice as many gags as I could get as an American reading subtitles. Even so, what a funny funny movie. It's not quite as zany as a spoof like \"Airplane\" (nor quite as funny, which of course is hard to do), but it takes the Sean Connery vintage James Bond film model and really does a parody worthy of 007. And of the franchise, which of course is bigger than Bond, bigger than Ian Fleming could have ever dreamed.But hold your horses--this is a parody of the real OSS:117. Yes, a French author created a Bond-like spy in the 1950s, and this movie and its 2009 sequel are really playing a double-edged game. They bring the old French spy to life (the original was a French-speaking American, bizarrely enough), and they make fun of him, of Bond, and of 1960s super slick sexist movies all around.The star here, the Sean Connery of this spoof (he even looks a bit like the Scottish actor), is Jean Dujardin. He's brilliant. He's funny, campy, silly, serious, and subtle about it all. He plays the role with a kind of oblivious self-ridicule that Woody Allen and Peter Sellers were so good at. It's great stuff.And he's backed up by a strong, if somewhat predictable, assortment of international thugs, beauties, and oddballs. There are shades of \"Charade\" here as well as the original \"Pink Panther\" movies. The scoring is amazing, composed with that Henry Mancini flair to a T and recorded with the familiar bright, echoey sound studio fullness of the time. Equally authentic are the opening credits, which were so convincing I had to double check when the movie came out. I was thinking, wow, a lost 1960s gem.But it's a brand new gem, or almost gem. Time will tell if this will hold up over the years, but it's a kind of must-see now for anyone into Bond films, the 60s, French humor, or just a well made movie with lots of gags. Like the gag where the noisy chickens go silent when the lights go off, and so our hero delights in turning the lights on, and off, and on, and off. Just wait and listen. It'll slay you.","Seems like M.Hazanavicius is back!The man behind \"la classe américaine\" comes back with a really fun and clever sequel to those old-fashioned OSS-117...Whereas directors tend to \"over-actualize\" sequels of old classics (remember the avengers,urk), Hazanavicius chose to work on a really cheap hero, OSS-117, a kind of low-budget french 007, and decides to do it in a old-school way...The photography, the body attitudes, the fights choreography and the FX, everything is like an homage to the way films were made back in the 50s.And it works, as the tone and jokes of the movie are really good! Jean Dujardin embodies perfectly this stupid-arrogant-macho-selfish french spy, lost in a country he understands only in terms of folklore and inferiority.Yes, that's it, just the way the occident uses to consider its colonies back then (and, oh no, I won't say it has anything to do with what happens nowadays in the very same area...ah ah)...He just looks like an unfrozen Lino Ventura, with something like 40 pounds less, which is perfect for the role.The other members of the cast fit perfectly as well, with all you can dream of Russian spies, Egyptian independantists and former Nazis.And of course, the women, as there has to be \"femmes fatales\" in any good spy-movies... The plot is good (maybe not brilliant but really good enough...), taking place between actual historical facts, and remembering us in a funny way how France (and the others) treated its colonies back in those days. It all starts in 1955 with a British spy disappearing while tracking a Russian cargo full of weapons in Suez.Then France sends his best friend, agent OSS-117, to discover what happened to both the shipment and the agent... The fact is that this agent is really as dumb as can be, and he slips through the story without even understanding it, solving it in a very clouseau-esquire way. I have to say I had a bad feeling about the movie, as the publicity made around it was quite frightening, and as french humor tends to be quite populist and flat (forget about les bronzés 3 or camping...) but I was really surprised, and in the good way! I highly recommend it, whether you want a good parody of Bond-esquire movies (much more fun than in D.E.B.S. for example, but less skirts) or you're a fan of that genuine and candid way of filming they had back in the 5Os. Yes, that's it clever and (really!) funny, you've got the point once again Mr Hazanavicius!","Just saw the movie, it's actually pretty good. The trailers'd left me an impression of either yet another Dujardin one-man-show-turned-film (à la _Brice de Nice_) or an expensive, stupid French comedy. Surprisingly, it's neither. Secret agent OSS 117 is stupid, but at least he sort of knows it, whereas I've always found that James Bond was stupid but acted like a smart arse. Dialogue is witty with a lot of tongue-in-cheek humour that one would expect from a British rather than a French movie. The women and the music are beautiful. A refreshing trip into the past, when the bad guys were ex-Nazis or Soviet brutes, cars were shiny, and France had colonies!","OSS 117 was fun from start to finish.It's difficult to define why one film touches or connects with you or not, and I won't try to analyze such perfect comedy, so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to it :)!Everything is old fashioned here, from women's clothes (sigh!), Mambo dance, the \"hero singing\"... (\"Bambino\" sounds like an Italian canzonetta sung in... arabic :)!).Hubert is physically imposing, but dumb as hell. From all the 007s, he looks like Sean Connery, but is definitely more sympa because he's... silly, speaks his mind all the time, giggles, even has some homoerotic fantasies and there are rumours about him. In short, as an anti hero, he rocks :)! Sometimes he only raises his eyebrows or frowns, and that's all it takes to make you laugh. Bérénice Bejo is the true queen of the film. Graceful, treacherous but with ideals. Aure Atika, to the contrary, is reduced to a femme fatale of sorts. It's surprising to see her that \"sexy bomb\", thou.You just can't compare it with \"Austin Powers\"! I agree with Amazon's D. Hartley (Seattle, WA) on it being respectful to the genre.Which is your favourite scene? One of my favourite scenes is the \"fight of the chickens\" with the masked villain. But the truly perfect one is when chatting at the cocktail with his contacts, how they all mutter platitudes with confidence... This scene alone makes the comedy genre worthwhile.","A spoof on James Bond about OSS operative stunningly performed by Jean Dujardin . Comedy spy-thriller with Jean Dujardin as inept secret agent versus nasty high-ranking Nazis and arms smugglers . Secret agent OSS 117 foils Nazis , beds local beauties , and brings peace as well as mayhem to Cairo . It's 1955 by time of dictator Nasser and the secret agent Hubert Bonisseur De la Bath, a.k.a.

With one shot at redemption, he must employ all kind of means to unravel a web of conspiracy that runs throughout an ambitious plot . Hubert must use every trick in his play-book to achieve his objectives . For Hugo Bonisseur, disaster may be an option, but failure never is. This original installment is an acceptable comedy though the formula is well known with 'The Pink Panther' series and recently with 'Johnnny English' by Rowan Atkinson . It stars clumsy Jean Dujardin as one man show accompanied by a gorgeous Berenice Bejo . The movie gets entertaining and hilarious moments here and there. This slapstick picture contains amusing , funny scenes , fresh and diverting moments but also flaws and gaps . Jean Dujardin steals the show parodying the ordinary international secret agent , James Bond-alike , including his ordinary faces , grimaces and gestures ; he plays stunningly the highly unorthodox agent, the inept and bungler secret agent from OSS .

The film was well penned and directed by Michel Hazanavicius that maintains the slapstick franchise . He also directed in similar style to the original film a sequel titled ¨OSS 117 Lost in Rio¨ with Jean Dujarjin , Rudiger Vogler and Louise Monot . Director and actors , Dujardin and Berenice Bejo , will repeat in the successful and recent ¨The artist¨ including Golden Globes and Oscars . Several chuckles and gags , the result of which is one acceptable entry on spoof genre . The flick will appeal to comedy buffs and Jrean Dujardin fans .","Excellent exercise on multiple plans:showing the not yet ended colonialism spirit in France more generally the boring mindset of superiority from all western peoplea renewal of the spy and thriller movies: OSS 117 is uncultured and stupid!The good idea is that, in spite of all these messages, it is a funny film, plenty of jokes and gags, very light and sparkling.Special mention to Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo.Definitely worth seeing. Wonder how it will be appreciated in US?Seems to be a success in France, so probably a next version will come.","I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival where it ended up as one of the audience favorites. This is a spoof on the french cottage industry of OSS 117 films of the 50's and 60's. The first OSS 117 film based on the novel by Jean Bruce was brought to the screen in 1956, long before the first James Bond film, staring Ivan Desny as Hubert Bonisseur De La Bath and six subsequent action adventure spy films were made up to 1970 with Luc Merenda, Frederick Stafford, Kerwin Matthews and John Gaven all taking turns as Oss 117. Jean Dujardin is in the title role in this comedic take on the series. As the film begins set in 1945 he has a french mustache and resembles Desny but as the film begins it's setting of 1955 he really looks like Sean Connery. Jean François Halim wrote this hilarious screenplay of a spy sent to Egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. It borrows on the silliness of Naked Gun, Get Smart and the Pink Panther and uses fresh humor on current events in a delightful combination that international audiences will enjoy and I am sure this will be the only the first of more to come of a revived OSS 117 reworked to comedy adventures. Michel Hazanavicius directs. I would give this a 7.5 and recommend it.","OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies is a brilliant satire of the 60's spy movies, not just James Bond, but the many European entries, as well. Jean Dujardin is wonderful as Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath, aka OSS 117. OSS 117 was a literary spy from a series of French novels, which predate James Bond. In the novels, he was an American from Louisiana, who worked with the wartime OSS and post-war CIA. Here, he is pure French, with all of the connotations of the 1950's: chauvinistic, pompous, patronizing, clueless, and suave. He begins his mission to Cairo, to uncover the reasons behind the disappearance of another agent and friend. What he finds is a chicken warehouse, Egyptian revolutionaries, Nazis, a missing Soviet ship, femme fatales and a flair for singing in Arabic.The film has great sight gags, including a running gag involving chickens and light; a chicken fight that has to be seen to be believed, rear screen projections that take one back to the 60's, a bit of homo-eroticism, and an argument with a muezzin, over a loudspeaker. Hubert is so clueless, he actually believes everyone would treasure a picture of failed French President Rene Coty.This is great fun, with far more subtle wit than Austin Powers. It has playful fun with the trappings of the Connery Bond films, as well as the style of film-making in that era. Like Austin he is totally clueless, but unlike Austin, he is charming and sophisticated. It reminds you of what used to be great about the Bond films, while gently (or blatantly) nudging them for their colonialism and undercurrent of racism.If you love cool spy films of the 60's, you'll have fun with OSS 117. I can't wait for the DVD release of the sequel, set in Rio.","As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Westerners, at Spy movies etc...and at a lot of other things too, en route... I already saw it 3 times and each time i discovered new things and laughed to tears... Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Béjo, Aure Atika the director and all the cast, all the crew did a fantastic job. This movie is funny but is although much more than that : it's got plenty of levels to it. You laugh because of simple gags, because of some critics made with wit (the movie's courageous enough to be critical), because of physical comedy, because you believe in the characters etc... Esthetically and musically, it's a success too. Go see it if you can.","That's how I'd sum it up! There were other who said, Naked Gun meets James Bond. I think mine is more accurate, but I'm not neutral on that point ... ;o) This movie is kind of a blast from the past. It reminds you of the old movies (from the '50s & '60s) and that's not only because it plays in that time period (1955 to be exact, with the Flashback exception), but it's the mood the movie is made in and it shows on screen! The main actor here (who is as I've been told very popular in his homeland France), is perfect in his role here. He's the spy with the number 117 attached to him. There is one character who sums him up in the movie, by asking a question, about if he's good or not ... you'll see when you watch the movie! Very funny indeed this is and if you like your spies mixed with comedy with old school flair, but not taking itself or anything else for that matter seriously, than you need to watch this! :o)","OSS 117 is another star vehicle for Jean Dujardin, star of the ill-fated BRICE DE NICE. He fairs much better here as Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath than as his own creation, BRICE DE NICE, which was great at the beginning but was painfully unfunny for most of the film. Dujardin is fun as the clueless French espion, if you can tolerate his mugging (some of my friends found it annoying). The comedy is light and breezy but it's not laugh out loud funny. It made me smile but not laugh out.The best thing about OSS 117 is the look of the film. Shot in Morocco, the production values are beautiful and perfectly captures the early James Bond films with Sean Connery. In fact, one can almost see Dujardin as Bond, if he didn't play it for comedy. Dujardin has star quality and his future in the movies is guaranteed. I can't wait for him to star in something than the average stuff he's doing right now. His break-out role in a break-out movie has yet to come.","I must I was a little skeptical when I entered the cinema to watch OSS117 : french comedies tend to be so self-satisfied nowadays that only the most stupid ones score high at the national box-office. But I was surprised that though the humor does not always reach the level of the Monthy Pythons, the many references to the French's vision of the world in the 1950, which OSS117 represents, are hilarious et the director managed to recreate film-making style of that time with an astonishing fidelity. To put it short, a bit of a good surprise, not to mention the excellent performances from various secondary actors. And at least for once, Jean Dujardin's style (which can get on many people's nerves) complies perfectly with the character he plays.","What a pleasure. This is really a parody. Only french people can do that kind of thing without being coarse. And as a result, you spend a really good time watching Jean Dujardin playing the dumb. Most of the movie stands on his shoulders, and he has them wide enough to make this movie a good one. He has the perfect way of overdoing the James Bond kind of guy that he is no match for Mike Meyers in Austin Powers for example. The dialogs are also good enough to keep up the attention of the spectator, with a lot of stupid jokes, that's really perfect. Both of the women having the main parts in the movie bear the comparison with the main character, and that was a challenge. There is no really plot in this movie, but that's not what is expected in this kind of movie. You just wish to laugh one hour 40 minutes, and that's precisely what the movie manage to do. It deserves the success it has in France","I remember when I went to the theaters in Paris in April 2006 to witness this fine piece of work starring \"Un Gars, Une Fille\" and \"Brice De Nice\" comic marvel Jean Dujardin...I had read no review and not heard a single thing about it outside of the movie being a \"comedy\" and \"spoof\" of the spy genre... Never seen the original OSS117 movies either while being versed into James Bond since the 70s... As a big fan of the french movies of the 50-60's and 70s, I'm becoming tired and uninterested into the current wave of ultra bland, vulgar and awful french movies so I wasn't expecting much...And glad I was cause this came as a wonderful treat and surprise for the old amateur of movies from my mother country. From the beautiful locations in Casablanca, Morocco to the terrific costumes and perfect dialogues, this was a blast from the past !Former french TV comical show writer Jean-François Halin and Michel Hazanavicius got a lot of fun using absolutely ANY old school word from french vocabulary, words that are considered \"has been to current french population and that seemed to be a relic from another world and life...And that's the full charm of those dialogues for me, reminiscent of the masterpieces starring French Icons Jean Gabin, Lino Ventura or Bernard Blier and such absolute greatness as \"Les Tontons Flingueurs\" and the greatest french screen writer and dialoguist of all time, Michel Audiard !That's why only french talking people can truly enjoy every single nuance of Hubert Bonnisseur De La Bath (aka Lucien Brammar), Larmina, Pelletier and any character from the movie.I've yet to watch it with English subtitles to witness if they've done justice to Halin/Hazanavicius master work on the words but in French, it's a delight to my brain !The acting is on par with the locations, costumes and dialogues with Dujardin being Dujardin (his epic ultra white smile always cracks me up), Mrs Béjo (aka Michel Hazanavicius' wife) is wonderful as Egyptian modern woman Larmina, Aude Atika is also delicious as The Princess Al Tarouk, the old time great and mentions to the actors who play Setine and Muller who do shine especially during the hammam (for Setine) and original party scene with terrific words of play between Dujardin, Richard Sammel (Muller) and Costantin Alexandrov (Setine) that had me in absolute tears. Last but not least Claude Brosset as De La Bath boss aka Armand Lesignac, is pure old school french brilliance.I give the movie only 7 because of a few moments that were plain boring and embarrassing aka the nazi part inside the pyramid and the one moment with Belgian Chicken owner and ultra nemesis of Lucien Brammar's SGEP (the actor is awful and was a total letdown during the four men exchanges in the first party).Last but not least the climax was kinda boring and uneventful (only the two females catfighting on the ground was fun and entertaining to me).But that's minor complains next to legendary French-Egyptian singer Dalida's Bambino cover by one surprisingly good singer Jean Dujardin (with epic head banging for good measure)or the multiple\"j'aime...\" hilarious one liners, the excellent pursuit in the streets of Le Caire (or should I say Casablanca again, looks totally like Morocco and NOT Egypt). Last but not least, nobody here mentioned the perfect and beautiful musical score. The OSS117 theme remixed with oriental instruments and vibes is so haunting and catchy It's currently stuck in my head. All in all, a breathe of fresh air and an oddity in a very mediocre french movie scene that is just a poor old man version of the great era of french movies from the XXth century.The use of technicolor was truly the icing on the cake on this very delicious cake of cinema.","A year ago, I had never heard of Michel Hazanavicius, Jean Dujardin, or Bérénice Bejo. They became well known to Americans following the release of and Oscar wins by \"The Artist\" (which is worth seeing). But they had worked on movies before that. One of these was \"OSS 117: Le Caire nid d'espions\" (\"OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies\" in English). Dujardin plays a spy very similar to James Bond who investigates intrigue and arms trading in Egypt. Much of the movie makes fun of western attitudes toward the Arab world, and in particular plays on the stereotypes of French men. It's the sort of movie whose purpose is mainly to be funny, and it succeeds. Bejo looks mighty sexy as the spy's contact in Egypt, as does Aure Atika as an Egyptian princess. Whether or not you've seen \"The Artist\", you're sure to love this one. In fact, watching either one is sure to help you appreciate the other more. Really cool.","Adventures of agent OSS 117, a French colleague of James Bond. Upon hearing about the death of his long-time friend in Cairo, agent OSS 117 (Jean Dujardin) is sent to investigate revolutionary activity and the disappearance of a weapons ship in Egypt. Aiding him is an attractive but unenthusiastic lady assistant (Bérénice Bejo).Unlike the earlier books and movies in the series, this film takes a parodic approach to the character as well as other spy films of the 1960s, notably Connery-era Bonds: a pre-credit sequence, animated opening titles, brass music, faded cinematography and poor rear projection in driving scenes are all there. OSS 117 also takes Bond's characteristics further by being an openly smug and ignorant colonialist. There are many funny scenes, ranging from subtle (implications of OSS 117's homosexuality) to slapstick (using live chickens as throwing weapons). Recommended for spy movie fans.","Fans of the Pink Panther, Naked Gun, or Get Smart will certainly enjoy this farce that won one César and was nominated for four more.Jean Dujardin is Agent OSS 117, a man who wouldn't know a clue if it hit him upside the head. He is also a reflection of the colonialist attitude indicative of the West.All of the Russian spies, Nazis, and Muslim radicals around him are just as stupid, but there is Larmina (Bérénice Bejo) and the Princess (Aure Atika) to keep things interesting.OSS 117's uncanny ability to pick up languages, play musical instruments the first time he picks them up, and sing like a native are all more impressive than Bond's tricks, but he is still stupid.","A friend of mine told me that this movie was worth a watch and that himself as well as his whole family had adored this funny movie. As I am fan of spy or police parodies in the key of \"Mad Mission\", \"The naked gun\" or \"Austin Powers\", I was looking forward to watch this movie with him.But this movie is maybe the worst comedy movie I have ever seen because it didn't make me laugh one single time. The main character is an annoying, superficial and stupid racist, sexist and anti-cultural snob that has to investigate on a boring random case along side with boring random characters. I know that the directors exactly wanted to create such a superficial and arrogant character but as I didn't get connected to him, I didn't get connected to the whole movie. The jokes are so childish that it made me despair. You open the lights and some chickens make some noise. You hit a muezzin because he wakes you up in the morning. You hit a partner because he forgets a stupid password. There were so many countless and boring jokes that the story line becomes absolutely secondary and random stuff and the pseudo-twist in the ending is also quite predictable.I really lost one and half hour of my precious life on this unfunny and annoying piece of garbage. I give one point for the beautiful landscapes and the fact that I was still hoping that there would be a turning point or a really funny scene in this movie which made me watch this until the very end. Well, I was wrong, but at least, I made it through the whole movie. But I wouldn't recommend to any one to live the same fate as I did. Just ignore the influenced and not very objective reviews by some French fans of the main actor (who did a decent job in the cult movie \"Brice de Nice\"). Give yourself a little gift and watch the \"Mad Mission\" series or if you want something French, go for \"Welcome to the Sticks\". Even my girlfriend who normally laughs about anything and adores comedy movies found this one annoying and boring.","Special Agent OSS 117, perhaps France's most famous answer to Britain's James Bond, enters the 21st century with \"Cairo, Nest of Spies\", but unfortunately the producers don't seem sure of how to package his return: as a legitimate period spy flick, or as a spoof of the genre? As a result, although the film has the colorful credits, the exotic locations, the beautiful women, the intrigue of the Bond universe (and even a leading man who looks a bit like the 1960's Sean Connery), it's neither funny enough nor exciting enough. The indecisiveness extends to the way Jean Dujardin plays the role of OSS 117: at times competent, suave and on top of the situation, at other times bumbling and making a fool of himself. Even the fight scenes range from serious (and surprisingly good) to slapstick (two guys throwing chicken at each other). The highlight - and practically the climax - of the film is the catfight between Bérénice Bejo and Aure Autika: I like it when women use real fighting moves instead of just rolling around. (**)","Saw the move while in Paris in May 2006 ... I was debating between that and mission impossible...I am very glad I choose OSS 117 not only because it was funny but might as well watch a FRench movie while in France. I had a great time... would recommend it. It is important to have some understanding the French society of Today to really enjoy the humor of this movie ... cannot wait for the DVD to come out... I don't know how some of the 'jeu De mots' 'puns' would be translated in English I 'll certainly buy it when it is out! P.S. I saw on 'BRice de Nice' which is a movie starring Dujardin that all kids were talking about in France. this movie is a comedy but sillier than one can imagine...in comparing both movies I have to say that Dujardin did a good job in OSS 117.","There are probably more spy spoofs than serious spy movies in the world. Most, like the execrable Dean Martin 'Matt Helm' series, are pretty bad and unfunny to boot. Only a few, like 'Our Man Flint,' and the 1st Austin Powers film, are any good.'OSS 117: Cairo Nest of Spies' is, subtitles and all, pee-your-pants funny. The lead is like a Gaullic Peter Sellers, except somehow all the funnier for being French. Seriously, this guy's comedic performance is so funny I could sworn I was high on weed, except I haven't been high on weed for 25 years.The writing, direction, camera-work and supporting cast are all top-notch. Superficially, this film has the look of a serious 1960's spy film, which is exactly the right thing to do with a spoof of this nature.Fans of classic comedy, especially of the great Peter Sellers, would be highly likely to enjoy this film. People who have trouble with subtitles, however, might have trouble so think about that if it applies to you.","By strange coincidence I've started to watch this move straight after Brice de Nice and the good thing was that not many movies could be worst than Brice de Nice, so I was really looking forward for something better which would make me forget this horrible flop.Unfortunately OSS-117 again left me disappointed - I don't know, maybe it's just problem with translations, but since \"Diner de Cons\" I haven't seen ANY French comedy that I would call really good. Even when I look at the reviews on IMDb only people from France are giving the OSS-117 high notes...For me this movie didn't really work - in some parts is as funny as real Bond movies, in others jokes were a little bit too predictable or too corny."],"review-user":["beachboygrl","clivey6","borgonovops","secondtake","zilief","guilhem_nou","stuka24","ma-cortes","pallach","johno-21","grendelkhan","Roublardise","kosmasp","Maciste_Brother","blaireaufarceur","Fifidou","madjikcavani","lee_eisenberg","random_avenger","lastliberal","kluseba","gridoon","privilege","flapdoodle64","adam-1009"],"review-date":["13 September 2008","19 November 2008","9 June 2006","14 September 2011","20 May 2006","1 May 2006","12 April 2009","9 February 2013","23 April 2006","19 January 2007","14 May 2010","8 May 2006","30 July 2007","6 December 2006","27 April 2006","8 May 2006","10 August 2013","16 July 2012","19 July 2010","16 May 2009","16 December 2010","3 August 2007","29 July 2006","16 September 2011","17 May 2008"],"review-rating":["9","8","8","8","9","7","9","7","8","7","8","10","9","6","7","8","8","8","7","7","2","5","7","10","2"],"review-title":[" Hilarious and Irreverent\n"," Shplendid!\n"," Light and refreshing - a must see\n"," Smart, snappy, hilarious, stylish--don't miss this James Bond spoof\n"," heeeeey but...but it' really funny!\n"," Tongue-in-cheek humour\n"," The best spoof I've seen on years!\n"," Fun and amusing spoof , vividly performed by Oscar winner recently , Jean Dujardin\n"," A very fresh exercise\n"," A fun silly comedy.
