{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091649/reviews"],"review-text":["Normally BBC productions of Jane Austen are pretty good but Northanger Abbey is just odd. What were they thinking? This film has little of Austen's charm and ironically mimics the Gothic novels that Austen so wonderfully mocked. Not only that, the \"gothic\" sequences are tacky, over-the-top, and frankly silly. The actress playing Miss Morland is poorly cast with no obvious appeal to attract the attentions of an eligible bachelor, and though I rather liked the creepy Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, he is not a bit like the novel, even when delivering dialog straight out of the book. Robert Hardy as General Tilney turned in one of his few terribly \"ham\" performances. This film was so bizarre and strange that I actually watched it again just to savor how freakishly wrong it was.","Sometimes, changes to novels when they're made into films are not only necessary, but a good thing. However, in the case of Northanger Abbey, it's a very, very bad thing. Not only is the story itself ripped to shreds, but the satire is almost completely absent from the film, and it's mixture of romance and intrigue doesn't even touch upon the biting commentary that Austen put into her work. It fails to be amusing or satirical at all, and instead turns the character's fascination with her fantasy world into mostly a drama.This affects the romance as well. It's meandering and aimless. Chemistry and interest are never established. The reasons Tilney is attracted to Catherine are completely absent from the film, leaving the audience to wonder what it is he sees in her at all.Hopefully some day soon, we'll get a more faithful version if Austen's satire.","Poor Jane Austen ought to be glad she's not around to see this dreadful wreck of an adaptation.  So many great Jane Austen movies have come out recently that this one deserves to be permanently buried along with two other movies I despise-The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit and the 1969 version of David Copperfield. My main beef with the movie is that it completely misses the point of the book.  Jane Austen was poking fun at the Gothic mania in her society, and much of the novel is tongue in cheek.  The movie, however, is serious and comes across terribly melodramatically. The lighthearted, fun-poking flavor of Austen's writing is completely and conspicuously absent from this ponderous foray iinto horror meets period drama.  The scenes of Catherine's imagination are both gratuitous and uninteresting.  Also, Henry Tilney is dreadfully unappealing.  Why, I ask, would anyone fall for him?    If you are looking for a fun-filled Jane Austen evening, watch Emma instead!","When Jane Austen wrote 'Northanger Abbey' she intended to poke fun at the trashy Gothic literature of her day, aimed at silly, young, impressionable females. The story was meant to gradually draw the character of Catherine Morland out of the fantasy world she had built for herself, and into reality. The typical language, characters and themes of a Gothic romance were sent up the whole way through and were shown to be the epitomy of bad writing.However, this adaptation seemed to embrace and flatter what it was that Jane Austen was attempting to satirise. It retained a gothic feel throughout and seemed to 'put back' what it was that Jane Austen was trying to 'take out'. Northanger Abbey became the mysterious castle, Henry Tilney became the intriguing Gothic hero, and the 'secret' which Catherine believed existed at the Abbey turned out to be real. One cannot help thinking that the makers of this adaptation hadn't read the book very closely as they seemed to have missed the point.Unfortunately with an adaptation of this type, when Jane Austen was writing she was assuming that her readers would be familiar with the Gothic genre. Filmmakers today would need to explain to the audience what the Gothic genre was all about, explaining why this adaptation contains so many fantastical elements that Jane Austen was attempting to escape from.All of this aside, it works quite well. The adaptation keeps to the storyline pretty much, and retains much of Jane Austen's witty dialogue. The music helps contribute to the eerie atmosphere very well. One cannot help but wonder at the beauty of this version. Perfectly cast and impeccably acted.","Jane Austen's novel is a satirical sweep at the Gothic novels then the fashion for young ladies to read, and her heroine Catherine Moreland is no exception. In her fantasy world there are always happy endings and intrigue, and she expects to find this as she accompanies the Allens to Bath.However, this adaptation misses the point of Austen's novel entirely, and is dull and ponderous (even at its short running time of an hour and a half). Katharine Schlesinger is irritating as Catherine, all wide eyes and empty head; while Peter Firth is nothing like my idea of Henry Tilney. Good to see Googie Withers, Robert Hardy, et al in supporting roles though, even if they are given little to do.And who on earth thought electronic music would be suitable to play over the opening credits? An appalling choice and totally out of step with the source material.","The errors of this film have been pointed out a myriad of times in previous reviews: The Marchioness is an added character with little apparent use. The Abbey was NOT supposed to be the creepy castle of Gothic lore, but a disappointingly normal and modern building that Catherine's imagination tries to make frightening, but cannot. Most of the actors are hamming it up left and right (I actually found that amusing in a not-so-negative way. Isabella Thorpe is not one whit more obvious than Lucy Steele in the celebrated Emma Thompson version.) The music is weird and entirely too presentÂ… had they toned it down a bit it wouldn't have been so intrusive.What saved it for me was Peter Firth. Yes, he was affected and simpering, but personally, I found him sexy as all get out. When he first appeared, I had never seen him before, and didn't think he was handsome at all, nor right for the part of Henry Tilney. But when he smiles at Catherine, it looks so warm, so genuine, that I stopped chewing my popcorn for a moment and thought \"Oh, I take it back. He's cute!\" He's got wonderful lips, too.And despite what others have said, he portrayed Tilney pretty much as the book does, in my opinion. Tilney is a strange fellow, folks. He's rarely serious, says bizarre things one right after another, quips and smirks, and masks his feelings utterly. I am certain he grows up to be Mr. Bennet. I never liked him till I saw this adaptation, but now, he's rather my favorite. But only if he looks like Peter Firth.","My mom, my cousins, and I are pretty big Jane Austen fans. We know all the words to the 1995 Pride and Prejudice masterpiece, and have watched Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma an embarrassing number of times. I've read all the books, and I've even sat through Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion a few times. So my mom and I thought it would be nice to see Northanger Abbey on film.Bad idea! This is just about the worst movie I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass, or the 1939 Nancy Drew movie I bought at Wal-Mart for $1 (my previous \"worst movies.\") The first thing wrong, which you notice in the opening scene, is that the \"heroine,\" Catherine, has a gruesome and weird imagination, inspired by trashy novels that a Jane Austen heroine would never touch. Throughout the novel, she has dreams (day and night) in which she is carried off by some hideous man with a greasy wig, dragged across a field headed for God-knows-what-all, and suddenly rescued by a dashing guy on a white horse.The second thing any viewer of the movie will instantly notice is the high-pitched wailing and saxophone music that is supposed to be the soundtrack. No dainty classical music or English country dances here! It is also evident, almost at first glance, that the actress (for lack of a better word) chosen to play Catherine is completely off. First, she is rather unattractive, and is rendered even more so by her un-Austenlike behavior. Her looks and movements are just wacky! Plus, they're completely affected and unbelievable.This sad lack of acting skills affects pretty much all of the actors in the film. Not even Mr. Tilney, the supposed \"dashing young suitor\" is decent.As more and more characters are introduced, a strange taste in costumes on the part of the filmmakers becomes evident. Huge, Marie Antoinette-style headdresses clash with the (for the most part) correctly styled Empire gowns. A French woman, apparently a friend of General Tilney's, is made up all in black as some sort of ancient Goth nightmare--she bears a striking similarity to Michael Jackson in a black dress. Her appearance is made even sillier by a HUGE half-moon beauty mark on her cheek. I also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all of the women were wearing.Another anomaly that kept my mom and I howling with laughter for about ten minutes was the \"bathing\" scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing in a big bathhouse together--probably not very likely in the early 1800s. Then we saw that all the women seemed to be wearing large china or plastic plates, worn around their necks with strings. The plates floated horizontally on the water, containing some mysterious pieces of...something. We guessed it was soap, then aromatic herbs, then finally, when the mystery substance began disappearing between shots, we deduced it was food. But I'm still not sure.And that's not even half of what's wrong with Northanger Abbey. My warning to anyone who is considering renting this movie: stay your hand. And if anyone is considering BUYING it--well, I don't even know what to say to that.You'd think that when the actors and others making this film got about 1/4 of the way through, they'd realize what a monster they were creating and stop. Unfortunately, they didn't, and Northanger Abbey was let out into the world.","My first hugely disappointing BBC/Jane Austen flick. The tone is off, the costumes are off, the hair is off, the music is from outer space, and Robert Hardy, bless him, looks like he's really annoyed to be in such a stinker. Even some of the casting is off. No, I take that back, a good director can make a silk purse out of a sows ear, so to speak. The performances in this thing are so over the top and melodramatic that it's almost a farce of a Jane Austen story, which is ironic since Northanger Abbey is a sort of homage/send up of the early Gothic novel. I wanted to slap the female lead after awhile; who made the decision that she should be such a ninny? I had to watch Pride & Prejudice ('95) immediately to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Phew!","The filmmakers were clearly on drugs. That's the only explanation I have. How else do you explain this travesty of a Jane Austen adaptation? Northanger Abbey is a parody of a Gothic novel. But this film was made as if it WERE a Gothic novel. The bizarre music and dream sequences to me suggest drug-induced hallucinations rather than a naive, innocent girl with an overactive imagination, as Catherine of the novel is...The actress who played Catherine just stands around bug-eyed all the time. Peter Firth looks at least 10 years too old to play Henry and he actually seemed a bit on the gay side to me. I don't see the attraction between him and Catherine. John Thorpe's portrayal was rather odd but Isabella actually wasn't that bad. But nothing could save this PIECE OF CRAP movie! One more thing- This film invents a character not in the book, a French friend of General Tilney's, \"The Marchioness.\" Why exactly they added her is beyond me. Must have been the drugs. She is scary-looking beyond belief, with white foundation, red lips and black lines randomly painted on her face (dimples?).You'd think this would at least be entertaining in a \"so bad it's good\" quality but unfortunately, it's not. It's just BAD.","Is it possible to give a 0 out of 10 rating? Because this one deserves it. While I'm not a big fan of Jane Austen's books, I sat through this one with two women who are. Well, at least we had a big laugh about how bad this film is. Robert Hardy was the only actor with any charisma in the whole thing, though he overdid it as he usually does (nearly as bad as William Shatner). But that wasn't enough to save this stinker from total suckitude. It's often hard to separate the girl's dream sequences from what is \"really\" happening, and so many holes are left in the story that you can barely figure out what is going on. Too many loose ends and the ending feels like a \"tune in again next week\" climax. The lead actress is too ditsy and weird-looking to be a heroine, the leading man is too goofy-looking and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some kind of cheap new-agey pet project of the director's hippy daughter (I mean saxophone??? mixed in with some kind of spacey operatic female wailing?). So, in conclusion, I suggest you blow the budget and order a DVD of this one as soon as possible. Especially if you like disappointment.","Although it strays away from the book a little, you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings.The scenes in Bath are just how they should be. Although if you have watched it as many times as I have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, I like the scene where they are in the Hot Baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? You could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. It also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. The ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene.Northanger Abbey looked suitably imposing, but I enjoyed the Bath scenes better.Schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the best performance as Mrs Allen I feel.Ugh Peter Firth as Mr Tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it's hard to think of him being in love with Catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either.General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy, and Stuart also gives a sort of good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but I quite like it.I can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. The marchioness! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy.some of the script is peculiar. When Catherine is asking Elinor Tilney about her Mothers death she asks \"I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear?\" What a silly thing to say! Elinor's calm response is stupid too.anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me","I got this movie with my BBC \"Jane Austen Collection\" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, \"My only acquaintance...tore my gown.\" This movie is now my current Austen favorite. I've watched it 7 or 8 times so far. The acting, to my mind, is incredible. The way I notice good acting is when I find myself looking up from whatever I'm doing (sewing, though not my fingers together, hopefully, or boondoggling or whatever) in order to watch the character deliver his lines. It's the turn of expression, the cast of posture, that make the words come alive -- that's what makes good acting, as far as I'm concerned.Well, I watch almost every part of \"Northanger Abbey\" because almost all the actors play their roles with such charisma. Peter Firth is amazing as Mr. Tilney, the perfect blend of Bathian fop and real, masculine hero - you're not sure until the end whether he's after Catherine's money or not. I love his touch of (Welsh?) accent. Mr. and Mrs. Richards are charming: the combination of their behaviors - especially Mr. Richards' high voice, lending counterpoint to his wit and wisdom - makes them so real. General Tilney as the hard-hearted father who may possibly be a murderer is fascinating, too. And Captain Tilney, the grinning rake who is so clearly enjoying himself... and the moneygrubbing sister and brother whose names I can't currently remember - the two of them are so perfectly, at once, smart and smarmy.The other reason I love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all the Jane Austen adaptations. I know this was one of Austen's weak points (well, it is as far as I am concerned): even though all her novels are love stories, it's hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end. And if they're aren't really in love, then what's the point? All the other adaptations I've seen (other than the early Olivier/Garson one) have pretty cold-fish kisses at the end, if they kiss at all. I don't at all like sex in movies but it really is necessary to have a heartfelt kiss in the end. And the ending kiss in Northanger is a doozy.The over-the-top approach to costumes, music, and lighting work very well as far as I'm concerned. And the script is extremely clever - the way we are educated about Gothic romance, highlife in Bath, Cathy's normal country upbringing, etc., is very well done, as they usually are in BBC productions. Also, I like the part when the little black page does the cartwheels. And the Marchionesse, I think, was an entirely appropriate and very clever expository device.Some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what Jane Austen intended to do in Northanger Abbey - she meant to make fun of Gothic romance, not promote it. But I don't think she meant to put \"Mysteries of Udolpho,\" etc., down. She was just making the point that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction. And this point is made when Mr. Tilney chides Catherine in his mother's room. Besides, General Tilney was a villain, albeit a prosaic one. That point was meant to be made, surely.","I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction?), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney. She is invited to visit the Tilneys at Northanger Abbey, the seat of the formidable (and somewhat financially challenged) General Tilney, who has the unfortunate misconception that there is wealth afoot.Where mutual attraction mixes with family finance, dispute is inevitable. This coupled with Catherines vivid imagination, leads her to fear for her safety. Her eventual departure is marred by accusations and counter accusations of deception and connivance.But the attraction between Catherine and Henry stands these trials. He returns to provide a happy ending. This final scene is especially compelling, given the incidental music of Ilona Sekacz.It may well be a \"bad\" production from the purists viewpoint, gaudy costumes and shaky performances not withstanding, but for me it's 88 minutes of bliss.","I just checked out Northanger Abbey from the local library, and wasn't expecting much.  Imagine my suprise at this gothic treat!  Northanger Abbey is one of the most eerie places that you have ever seen, with empty passageways and ornate rooms full of hidden secrets.  The glory of the movie is that it never reveals all: your imagination runs free, running with the imagination of the main character, one Kathrine M.  She is a girl of wild imaginations, a reader of gothic fantasy that she brings into her (and our) real world.If I were to use one word to describe this excellent movie, it would be surrealistic.  Dreams are woven throughout the movie, enhancing the mood. Sometimes, it is hard to tell what is real and what is not; this is intentional, I believe.Atmosphere reigns supreme.  The music is not what you'd expect of a movie by Jane Austen: it is eerie, flute and drum based, high and haunting with an undercurrent of fear.  If a soft, pleasant tune were playing in Northanger Abbey, it would be positively inviting.  Now, it is foreboding, a grim and stark-walled palace of madmen. (But!  The characters! You shall have to see them for yourself!)If you are looking for a most enjoyable evening, look no further than Northanger Abbey.","The BBC and the Arts & Entertainment Network should be ashamed of themselves for foisting this unfortunate production onto the world.  The acting is, with the exception of Robert Hardy as General Tilney, amateurish at best and excruciatingly painful at worst.  The costumes are over-the-top and feature some truly ghoulish excesses -- was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for women's hats?  Surely EVERY woman in Bath didn't have feathers in her headpiece in the early 19th century.  The production values are poor and the pacing of the film makes one feel it was hastily and clumsily edited at the last minute.  Altogether an agonizing film that I had to force myself to watch to the end.  It's a shame, as the producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and location shooting.  Compared to Emma Thompson's sublime \"Sense and Sensibility\" or the extraordinary 1995 production of \"Pride and Prejudice\" or the subtle intensity of 1995's \"Persuasion\", this production of `Northanger Abbey' surely has Jane Austen turning in her grave.","This movie started off well enough, sticking to the mood of the book fairly well even if the acting was not top notch. The soundtrack was torturously bad. Saxaphone and electric guitars? It was gratingly incongruous. The female singer was positively dreary! In the second half of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn. Too dark for Austen. Northanger Abbey is made a dark and scary place whereas in the book it was disappointingly tame and modernized to Catherine's eyes.Who in the heck is this Marchioness with the ghastly makeup and wig? A totally extraneous and unnecessary character.One of the key elements in the book is the General is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherine's books. His monstrosity is far more complicated in his oppression of his children's spirits and his treatment of Catherine based on money concerns alone. He does not lock up his wife or kill her but he does send Miss Morland on a 70 mile trip alone in a hired carriage with not enough money to pay her way home. Only her friend Miss Tilney's thoughtfulness in handing her some money on the way out the door saves her from being stranded. This whole point gets seriously muddled in the film. They make the General too dark from the outset.Peter Firth should have not sung! This part was painful to watch. His depiction of Tilney wasn't too bad but it was a shade dark in places. Henry Tilney of the book made sport of Miss Morland's imagination on trip to Northanger but he was never dark. Firth would have benefited from better direction. The young lady who played Isabella needed a better acting coach. John Thorpe was appropriately odious. The striped waistcoat and coattails combo he wore was ghastly! It certainly fit his character.I think the film would have fared much better with a completely different soundtrack. It cast an oppressive pall over the entire movie. If I watch it again it will be with the sound OFF and subtitles on. Perhaps I would give the film a 4 then.The sound quality of the DVD was quite poor. The picture quality was not much better. This is glaringly noticeable on a digital television.When I think of what this film could have been, I think of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.","... did they bother making this? My advice is: steer clear! The film cuts a lot of scenes from the book - which is understandable for a movie - but instead of keeping some of the better ones from the book they decided to add some needless (and crap) ones of their own devising.The casting is awful - excepting perhaps the actress who plays Elinor Tilney. All the characters are painfully overdone and you spend your time being irritated with the actors. Catherine is beady eyed and silly, Henry is neither young nor dashing and is a bit on the horny side for my liking, General Tilney is portrayed as a dirty old man, John Thorpe is revolting (I know he's supposed to be, but not THAT much. The actor overdoes it so badly you expect him to start drooling over Catherine any second. At one point he actually makes a \"phwoarrr\" noise... PLEASE!) and Isabella's attempts at acting flirty are so embarrassingly bad it makes you laugh.The costumes are off (what's with the bright red lipstick what were they thinking?), the soundtrack is wrong and all of Austens satire is lost.The camera-work can be described as dodgy at best and the sound recordists absolutely did not know what they were doing...All in all: the worst Austen adaptation in being (and I have seen the latest Mansfield Park so that's saying some...)","I've read this book probably 4 times, and loved it every single time.  I'm afraid this movie has missed the mark.  Well, no, it hasn't missed the mark - it doesn't even know where the mark is in the first place!  First of all, these actors are nothing like I pictured the characters as I read.  I may have pictured them somewhat differently from how Austen described them, but nevertheless I find it very hard to accept them as the characters in the book.  They just don't fit.  Second of all, why are there so many scenes cut out and new ones put in?  It felt like I'd missed so much when the movie was over, and that it was rushed and incomplete.  And all of her visions!  Some of the scenes in this movie are very similar to those in John Gielgud's \"Prospero's Books,\" which I know is lauded as brilliant filmmaking. However, here it just distracts from the story and creates an uncomfortable situation for the viewer.  If you love Jane Austen, I would suggest not seeing this movie.  Wait for someone like Emma Thompson or even Kenneth Branagh to do justice to it (although I hope he doesn't cast himself as Tilney!!).","This is a terrible movie, that is barely recognizable from the book, although they have sort of similar plots. The time it takes to watch this movie (which is only 1.5 hours) would be much better spent doing anything else, including watching grass grow. The addition of poorly done fantasy scenes make Catherine seem insufferably silly. The actress who plays Catherine also comes across ditzy as all goodness and looks constantly surprised, even when she's supposed to be looking lovingly into her Tilney's eyes. Honestly!! The movie ends with a Catherine fantasy-like scene where one can't help but wonder if it's happened or if she's merely delusional, and not in the good way that makes you think but in a perfectly horrible way that basically sums up the terrible movie. The only good thing about the movie is the title, which was written by Ms. Austen herself. I generally love the BBC's productions but this one is horrid.","It is a sad sorry state that leaves me, a fan of both Jane Austen and BBC period dramas, unable to say anything good about this adaptation of Northanger Abbey. Sadly I bought my copy of this 1986 version without reading reviewsÂ…I clearly should have investigated.The best way to describe it is a production directed by someone who saw the film Amadeus about 20 times to many. The music all saxophone and synthesizer was complete rubbish and ruined the period milieu.The acting was terrible. The lead actress seemingly believes staring bugged eyed conveys innocence. It merely makes her look perpetually surprised, which hardly fits every scene. The lead actor only is slightly better, although he is lit sometimes so badly that he comes off a sort of frightening leader of an 80s rock band. In fact the whole production seems to be directed to be a music video rather than a wonderful Austen film. I seriously wonder about the availability of drugs in the UK in the 1980sÂ…yes, it is that sort of film.If you have choice invest you money in the 2007 Northanger AbbeyÂ…100% better.","Over all the movie was \"ok.\" It ruined the story from the book and made it seems like the director was making fun of the whole story. I love Jane Austen and i've just about read all of her books. Northanger abbey is one of my favorites and I wanted so much to see it one film. So I bought the movie thinking I was going to love it but when I watched it I hated it. The movie turned the relationships upside down and gave her these stupid day dreams that just left you confused and tired of the movie. The end left you wondering if she was dreaming or if it was real. Over all if you love Jane Austen I would definitely tell you NOT to watch it. It's not worth it.","What an awful adaptation. The worst part was the music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800's?????? The only character that didn't bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one, and I love Jane Austen movies usually. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I don't quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another. Isabella and her brother were way overdone; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the \"bad guys\" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good, isn't. This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen.","Northanger Abbey is not my favorite Jane Austen novel, but it has its charms. This movie doesn't. It has some of the same character names as the book, but the story is drastically altered, and the sweetest man in the whole Austen canon (unless Emma's Mr. Knightley gets pride of place) is made out to be a heartless and mercenary creep. One or two totally extraneous characters are introduced, and a palpable air of corseted perversion hangs over it all. I was so disappointed when I first saw it on its release in 1986; even today it ranks high on the list of films that disgrace the books on which they're based. Even Robert Hardy fans should give this one a wide berth. It has nothing, and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G, to recommend it.","Being a big Jane Austen fan, I had great hopes of seeing the timeless story of her \"Northanger Abbey\" come to life on video.  Needless to say, that didn't happen.  Did the writers ever read the actual book?  It was not consistent in any likeness, in spirit or theme.  The characters had no depth, the music was irritating and distracting, and the plot was twisted and weird.  Jane Austen, I'm sure would be thouroughly offended, as will the veiwer of this B-style, twilight zone version of the classic.","Now and again, a film comes around purely by accident that makes you doubt your sanity. We just finished studying the novel, \"Northanger Abbey\", at school and decided to refresh our memory of this unexciting piece of humourless garbage with the BBC adaptation.The funny thing about Northanger Abbey is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself. The film is NOTHING like the book, for example, the subtly evil characters seem to have been turned into transparent stereotypes. John Thorpe looks like a leprechaun on acid while Isabella plays the role of slut. Catherine, the main character, is the most depressingly stupid and irritating actress on god's earth (she looks like a coffee addict, her eyes are like basketballs) whilst Mr Tilney looks and acts like a retired porno stunt double. The plot goes completely off the rails at certain points of the film, I don't know what the hell the director was thinking when for no reason at all, a 7 year old black kid who we've never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and starts cartwheeling in front of her. Yes, that's right, cartwheeling. Nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by Catherines \"fantasies\" in which she is being carried around a cathedral by an ogre.Northanger Abbey is basically visual euthanasia so if you want to murder your boss or something like that, BBC have basically discovered a new way to kill someone. Northanger is a barely laughably bad film.
