{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219854/reviews"],"review-text":["When this movie was shown on television, it wasn't announced as \"Disney's The Kid\", but just as \"The Kid\", a movie with Bruce Willis, and that's probably a good thing. I'm pretty sure I would never have taped it if I knew this was a Disney movie, fearing that all the syrupy nonsense would be too much for me to handle. Still, I don't know what made me decide to give this movie a try when I saw the title in the beginning of the movie, but in the end I was glad that I watched it, because it certainly wasn't as bad as I feared it would be.Bruce Willis is Russ Duritz, a wealthy L.A. image consultant who's about to turn forty. He's a cynical workaholic who has estranged from his father, who has no memories of his childhood and who doesn't have a girlfriend, a family or even a dog. One night he surprises an intruder, who turns out to be an almost 8 years old kid. But there is something strange about him. The chubby kid is named Rusty and has a lot of similarities with Russ. Soon they find out that Russ and Rusty are actually the same person. Together they make a journey into Russ's past to find the key moment that has defined who Russ is. How this is possible, what it all has to mean and how it will affect both their futures will only be clear at the end of the movie.In a way this is a very typical and predictable Disney movie with it's rather innocent and naive look on life, but I guess it can be enjoyable for adults as well. It is all very recognizable and it is a nice fairy tale about losing touch with your inner child. It certainly isn't the best movie ever, but it is some decent and heart-warming family entertainment that offers some nice acting and a good story. I would say: watch it with an open mind and you'll see it isn't as bad as you feared. I give it a 6/10.","I saw this on a plane. You know, you are strapped to a chair and forced to watch whatever garbage they put up there.And I have to say I actually had fun. Some scenes are sugary and over the top but the kid's performance is above average for children actors. Casting was perfect. One thing though: the music is inappropriate, heavy-handed and sometimes ruins the scenes. It is like asking Richard Wagner to write for an intimate comedy. Very weird.But I strongly recommended the movie to my mom. It is that kind of movie.","The Kid - At 39 years old Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money.  But everything comes at a cost, in this case no social life, no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone.   He just needs someone to show him the way.As I watched the movie, I kept wondering why Disney didn't pass this film on to Miramax - not because it's particularly daring or edgy, but because it is clearly a movie for adults.  This is exacerbated by the marketing campaign which is clearly targeting children - it is lumped in with trailers for \"Rugrats the Movie\", and \"Pokemon 2000\" (aren't they passe yet?).   But I quibble.I was impressed by the sensitive treatment of the subject matter - rather than the typical male midlife crisis that involves some pathetic sap buying a Porsche convertible and acting like a moron, Willis' character undertakes some serious introspection and takes stock of his life.  His guide on this journey of self-discovery is himself at age 8 (they never explain how Rusty arrives and frankly, I didn't care).   Young Rusty's innocence and unbridled optimism give him a distinct advantage in divining the truth - he sums up Russell's job as an image consultant thusly, \"You teach people how to lie and pretend to be something they aren't\".    In order for a good script to succeed, however, you need actors to bring it to life.  Not a problem here.Although Willis has thrice ignored W.C. Fields' warnings about starring with children or animals he has lucked out once again, meshing as well comedically with Breslin as he did dramatically with Osment. Willis manages to balance Russell's cutthroat powerbroker traits with vulnerability and confusion, without becoming ridiculous.  Breslin meanwhile gives a dead on portrayal of a kid from everyone's childhood - the one that always stuck out for some reason and got picked on.   We also get two bonus performances: Lily Tomlin is great as Russell's levelheaded assistant and Jean Smart is perfect as an insightful charming anchorwoman (I loved her in \"Guinevere\").The Kid is charming, heavy, and real.  And it will appeal to adults of all ages.","When the first trailer for this film was viewed by myself, I was curious as to what angle the storyline would take.  After all the plot of having one's childhood self return to the present leaves open many options.  Bruce Willis however does a superb job in the role he was given.  I was surprised to see just how well he could act in this part.  This is also a good career move as many others have said but after seeing it I now agree.  This film is mainly about remembering the kid you used to be, and coming to the realization that you aren't the adult you planned to be.  This is a wonderful story and a gripping tale that makes us all think.  Usually we scorn at \"What if...\" movies.  For example, Waterworld attempted to answer the question \"What if the world were to be covered with water and...?\"  But truthfully, nobody cared.  This movie however effects everyone in the theatre.  True, young children may not fully grasp the idea of growing up and having all your dreams fizzle away, but it leaves a great impact on the adults and parents of those children.  This movie is definitely worth seeing.  Although, it will be better the second time around because you won't be thinking so much (about how the kid got there, and why and all that stuff)  Just relax and have fun.  And take something with you when you leave that cinema.  Take that piece of your childhood you've forgotten and enjoy it.","Now for sure, this is one of the lightest-hearted stories that Bruce Willis has been in to date and yet,-- it is still touching. I really like Bruce's style and persona, I haven't loved everything he has ever been in, but he brings it to the 'Big-time' for me in most all his film endeavors.The story begins..... He is power, confidence and style with a capitol 'S' . He drives a Porshe he lives well, in a palatial estate with a grand view of the fair city. That's Russell Duritz. He is an image consultant to those who are on the top or rising to it. His acclaim, he is Russell Duritz, he knows what it takes to make it. It just seems that as life is going along swiftly and foundation-ally set, there is a problem, an intruder at his home, the alarm has been activated! Russell can't seem to figure out (for the moment) what is happening to him. It's different and yet it is somehow familiar. A small boy, who looks exactly like....-- him. As their lives run smack dab into each other, there seems to be a reason that is screaming out to him, \"You have unfinished business to take care of, now!\"Amy the supporting young lady of the story is probably the best balance that he has seen and has in his life. She works with him, puts up with his 'ego' and yet, she is smitten with Russell. Very much so. With Rusty his past 'self' now in the picture and talking a mile a minute, singing too late at night, everything that was foundational is becoming like jelly! Willis is fun, egocentric and at times out of his head in this lovable Disney modern times classic 'The Kid' and to add his little heavy-duty side kick Spencer Breslin is a perfect addition to this sparkling story of childhood to adult and back to childhood adventure. Chi McBride is an inspirational supporting character, as he is the heavy-weight champ, teaching 'little' Rusty how to box to defend himself against the bullies on the playground. All in all this is a real winner of a movie with even Lillie Tomlin as the secretary and aide to Russell. I originally saw this back in 2000' and then again years later, with equal enjoyment. This is a shiny family comedy that has a super ending that will warm the hearts of any Disney fan Recommended highly (*****)","From a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, this one is definitely worthwhile.  This is the second Bruce Willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity, off-color humor, profanity, or gratuitous violence. (I refer of course to The Sixth Sense.) Both movies are engaging on more than one level. This one is appropriate for children as well, although as others have pointed out, it isn't a flick FOR kids. I was bothered that the time travel device that drives this plot is never explained, except that we know Russell himself initiates it as a 70 year old.  Also, why does his dying mother have to come to school to get him when he wins the fight; why, if as his older self says, he has to fight that kid again and again for the next few years does his mother not have to come and get him every time, and why he doesn't learn to kick butt in the process. I also found the score rather annoying and not always appropriate to the action on stage. Good use of the red plane as metaphor, however.","The Kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant, Russ Duritz, who has lots of money, a good job, nice house, etc. The only problem is he doesn't have much of a social life as nobody seems to like him as he isn't always very nice. One day though things are about to change when an eight year old version of himself magically appears. This gives Russ a second chance to make things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead role here and he gives a really good performance. The Kid is a nice, heart-warming movie for everyone.","While my kids enjoyed the movie (and announced afterward that they want to buy it later) I think I got more out of it that they did.  The scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (I did not use the cutting comment aloud, but I thought it).  It is a feel good mid-life movie, a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the kid stay with Bruce Willis after he knows his Mom is dying?), but all in all and good time.  It also gave our family something to talk about - did my kids think my life was boring?  What do they expect at 40? How can you not like a movie that gets a good conversation going with your kids?","Like a lot of movies involving little kids, this starts off \"real cute\" and likable...and then, after about a half hour or so, becomes the reverse.That's certainly the case here in this time-travel story (which I usually love) where an adult meets a kid who his really him at the age of eight! Great premise and a great lead actor in Bruce Willis, but.....The kid \"Rusty\" is a smart-aleck and whiny brat and Willis Rusty grown up now as \"Russell\" gets abrasive with his constant yelling. That is entertainment? No, thanks.Young Breslin has gone on to become a very good child actor, being involved in a number of films including \"The Cat In The Hat\" opposite a more famous child actor: Dakota Fanning. Overall, a disappointing film, especially with all the good press this movie got when it was released.","I have been always wondering \"Can one truly explain the meaning of life in less than two hours?\" And here I got the answer after watching this movie for 3 times. This is certainly one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Disney tries to make the film in an interesting and lovely way so it can appeal to both the kids and the adults. But what lies behind the film by far beyond the comprehension of a normal kid. Here, let's first look at how other comments put it: `The movie starts by completely neglecting even an attempt at explaining how 8-year-old Rusty shows up on 40-year-old Rusty's doorstep\" But this is not true. Actually the film made a hard work demonstrated how Russ (Willis) --a successful image consultant and a rich jerk was haunted by the hallucination of a flying plane which was actually the same kind of a model given to him by his father as a present. Here Audey Wells present all the viewers a question as a shrimp in the later plot suggested it: you're having hallucination for a reason and you need to figure out what that reason is.But at that time, the film is not in a hurry to explain the reason. Later on Ross's hallucination got stronger and he even imagined a boy intruded into his house. Even more the hallucinated boy lead him to an old drome. From there Ross's dream or more accurately the psychiatric journey of exploring himself began. That exploration filled most of the film till the 8-year-old Rusty disappeared on the same drome (notice only at that time Russ's clothes changed back to the sleeping pajama). The main part of the film (that's what I called the exploration) centered on the questions that had puzzled Russ these days: What's wrong with him? Why he always said somebody call the Ouaaaaaaaaambulance? Why he had a twitch? What happened from being little Rusty and becoming Russ? What will be supposed to do with the relation with Amy? And finally what he will be doing in the later time of his life? The film did an excellent job in explain all these questions. Evenmore it raised another question: Is Russ really a loser? Here Jean Smart said something very inspiring: I mean how many of us grow up to be astronauts or prima ballerina? We just all do the best we can. This film presented the normal theme of midyear crisis in a swift and clever way without lacking of provoking thought.The main character especially Bruce Willis and Jean Smart worked very well to helped achieve visual effect as well as the profound theme.Russ got the answer and know what to do next, what about us?","\"The Kid\" is a movie that will touch the hearts of two groups of people - children and grown-up cynics. In the leading role is Bruce Willis, who in my opinion must be one of the most versatile actors around. He plays the part of the cynical jerk Russ very well :).For most of the movie you cannot help but to hate him as he constantly ridicules the weaknesses of the people around him, and love him as you somehow know that there's a tiny seed of kindness waiting to grow. Emily Mortimer is extremely lovable as Amy, who works for Russ. Her acting is good, and I have to admit that I had to succumb to her cuteness- and I doubt anyone could help but to cheer her on through the whole story, she's so good as Russ's employee, who would like to like him, but gets shoved off every time she tries to be nice.The story is fun and imaginative. Russ's eight-year-old self travels to the future to meet him as a thirty-nine year old. The young Russ doesn't think much of Russ's achievements (chickless, dogless...) while Russ doesn't want to remember that he was once an overweight, whiny loser.\nDon't write it off as just another family movie thinking that you'll be able to predict the  whole storyline. You won't. Sure, the guy gets the girl, and young Russ and old Russ grow to like each other and help each other out.\nBut as you watch the final ten minutes of the movie, as things start to get wrapped up, you will suddenly sit erect, brain churning, and when you figure it all out, you lie back, try to keep back the wide grin that is forcing itself on your face, give up, and say \"Holy smokes!\"","It is so nice to see Bruce Willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he really is a talented actor.  He shines in this film as the near-40-year-old image consultant who has totally lost touch with his inner child--until he meets him face to face.  This is one of those rare films that doesn't talk down to its audience and truly offers something for the WHOLE family.  It is about caring for each other, keeping some of the child inside you, and realizing that you don't grow up exactly the way you thought you would.  Willis seems to be building an impressive track record for working with kids (just witness \"The Sixth Sense\" with Haley Joel Osment), and he has great chemistry with Spencer Breslin here.  There is some nice photography and music, and the ending is wonderful and uplifting.  A great film to see with EVERY member of your family.","At first glance, I thought \"The Kid\" was a cheesy, patheticchildren's movie because of its PG rating. But, when I viewed, Ihad to eat my words. \"The Kid\" is one enjoyable movie! BruceWillis stars in probably his first Disney movie as Russ Duritz,a workaholic executive who is given a visit by his past, in theform of a chubby 8-year old, played with giddy intensity bySpencer Breslin. Soon enough, Russ is picking up the pieces ofhis dead-end life with the help of his time-traveling littlecounterpart. With good-natured performances, especially by Willis, who seemsfresh and awake, not grim and foulmouthed, like his previousmaterial. Breslin is also a hoot as the young Rusty. For onething I'll tell you, \"The Kid\" outruns \"Armageddon\" by a millionpoints, at least that's why lies in my o","The first few minutes showing the cold and crusty the Willis character were pretty enjoyable, especially with Jean Smart, but it really tanked after that.  This is just hackneyed big man and little irritating kid stuff from way back with no innovation at all.  I know that the casting probably picked this kid to show that Willis was just as irritating in his younger self, but I found this kid ESPECIALLY irritating and whinney.","Bruce Willis, as usual, does an excellent job.[warning:  may be considered a \"spoiler\"]While my friend thought it was good, I kept glancing at my watch during the entire movie wondering when it would end.  After seeing such great flicks as \"The Patriot\" and \"Chicken Run\" I was really disappointed in Disney's \"The Kid.\"Willis plays a middle-aged man with a harsh and realistic attitude on putting a positive spin on people's images (he's an Image Consultant).  An unknown kid shows up.  Yes, it's him but younger, and even Lily Tomlin can see him.  At this point I'm reminded of a cross between a poor \"Quantum Leap\" episode and a bad time traveling flick.Kid and Willis go through trying to figure out why he's in that time period. They figure it out.  They meet Willis when he's older.  Nevermind that it never goes into detail how old Willis teleports them between time periods and gets them together to begin with, how he got that knowledge to begin with, how he came to the realization that he needed to do this, and so on.Basically, it's a very tired, unoriginal, uninspiring plot that has some great actors in it.  The good news is that \"the Kid\" actor is nowhere near as annoying as he's presented in the trailers on television.","There are a few scripts like this one floating around Hollywood; this one is not even close to the best--just the first.  This is all production value, no substance, but the Disney name probably will help it.  A good idea, a wasted opportunity.","After 15 minutes watching the movie I was asking myself what to do: leave the theater, sleep or try to keep watching the movie to see if there was anything worth. I finally watched the movie: what a waste of time. Maybe I am not a 5 years old kid anymore!","As a word of explanation, Disney's \"The Kid\" has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Chaplin 1921 classic of the same name. What we do have is a pleasant enough, though unbelievable, feel good family comedy as only the folks at Disney can provide. Bruce Willis, in a change of pace, plays a self-centered stuffed shirt of an \"Image Consultant\". He degrades, not only his clients, but those close to him as well. You know that he is going to have to change before the final credits. Into his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of Willis' character as a nerdy 8 year old played with cutesy pie conviction by Spencer Breslin (Disney always finds these kids somewhere). This forces Willis to come to grips with his past and well..you know the rest. Appearing as Willis' love interest is Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as his Executive Assistant. Both have little enough to do as most of the movie involves the inter-action between the Willis and Breslin characters. \"The Kid\", though not the greatest of Disney movies is one nonetheless that you can sit down and watch with your family and come away from with a warm feeling.","The whole idea of someone meeting a younger version of themselves pops up in films quite a bit and this film is perhaps one of the better examples.The Kid is a mildly amusing film,that certainly has a lot of heart behind it. Bruce Willis reminds us why he is such a good comedic performer and is well supported by Lilly Tomlin and Emily Mortimer (who is not nearly as annoying here as she is in the terrible 'The Newsroom').However the star of the show is undoubtedly Spencer Breslin, who went on to be just as cute in The Santa Clause 2...and poor in The Santa Clause 3. In this though he's great and the relationship between him and Willis is the shining light of the film (apart from a nice cameo by Matthew Perry).Sadly though the film is slow at times and quite heavy on the sentiment. I know for some people it is the film of their childhood but for me it's just another average Disney film.","The surprise is not how good this film turns out to be.  With Willis coming off of \"Sixth Sense\" and Jean Smart and writer Audrey Wells following up on the underappreciated \"Guinevere\", I suspected there just might be something going on here.  The surprise is how what is being pushed as a Disney kid's film is actually a funny, moving and rather mature fable about losing touch with the child you were and the adult you wanted to be.  The kids in the audience were restless.  The parents were laughing...and a few even sniffling.  Not a great film, but a darn good one, with a message that will probably go over the heads of anyone under 30.","Bruce Willis, Spencer Breslin, Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin star in this 2000 comedy. This takes place in L.A. and Willis (Die Hard) plays Russ Duritz, a cynical, image-consultant who's about to celebrate his birthday. Soon, he's visited by 8-year-old kid, Rusty (Breslin) whom he learns is his childhood self and they help each other face their challenges/obstacles of the past and future. Mortimer (Scream 3) plays Amy, a friend & co-worker of Russ and Tomlin (9 to 5) plays his secretary, Janet. I've always liked this film, it's got humorous and a couple of heartfelt moments and Willis & Breslin are great in it. I recommend this.","Turns out it's not really a kids' movie - it's the story of a guy's mid-life crisis - but my kids (9 & 4) didn't seem bored. There were a couple of scenes where I expected the worst kind of saccharine cliches, but they actually turned out okay.Willis is above average, Lily Tomlin is basically perfect, and even the kid (Spencer Breslin) doesn't make you cringe.As far as the writer (Audrey Wells), it was about as good as her 'The Truth About Cats & Dogs' and better than 'George of the Jungle'. It will appeal to people who liked director Turteltaub's other big films (Phenomenon, While You Were Sleeping, Cool Runnings).","There are two ways of watching a movie for me. I can decide to participate, or if it doesn't seem promising for some reason, I can watch it for the craft. This is in the latter category. And it has two really interesting things to watch.I like Bruce Willis. He's a superb technician, which is why he can do comedy and, say Harrison Ford cannot. Watch how he carries not only himself, but the space around him. A certain zen. Lilly Tomlin helps - she's great, more of an intuitive, but isn't used well here.The other thing: the score here is elevated to the level of a major character. What's done is to use Disney's first rate expertise in personally dramatic music as surrogate for the viewer, and it is done well. Lots of cornets and bassoons. Real instruments, real voices in your head. When you do this, the music doesn't complement the action, it comments on it. It is in YOUR mind, not the world of the action. Very clever.","A nice comedy!!! A big round of applause to this great movie... Disney rocks so much for creating this movie... THis movie has great actings, Good storyline, Good structure of stories... Good scripts and anything in the movie set was good....The most famous and well known actor Bruce wills(Some of you might know him some might not) did a great job on playing Ross and this shows what reality will be like when you faced any problems... This also a great fantasy movie and not to mention, Great characters and some bad characters like the kid's dad and a gang of bullies...This is what i call the work of genius... And the top no.1 family's movie....Rating:10/10","The Kid is a funny film that brings us a Bruce Willis in a totally new kind of role for him. Bruce is an adult without a wife or family, without becoming what he wanted, but very very rich. Oh, and also without a dog. Everything's normal til one day a kid enters his house. Who? The adult at the age of 8. The kid hepls Bruce understanding the real values of life and manages to change him into a better person.Bruce plays for the first time in a film like this. He's great as Russ, the rich guy in search for the \"better he\". But the MVP of the film is definetely Norman Spencer, the kid. He is adorable. And most of all, he acts very very well. Still it's predictable and the ending is not as good as i expected. Also a few questions remain unanswered.All in all, The Kid is a good comedy, for both kids and adults, a family movie that will make you think. Think about your life, what you've accomplished.Vote: 6.5 out of 10."],"review-user":["philip_vanderveken","mauricio-19","Shiva-11","JackReese","buzznzipp1995","mark_r._mcdonald","famousgir1","KathND","ccthemovieman-1","xuguodong","tzehoong","Figaro-8","coverme6","guyb","allimid","movieguy-71","Catala","bsmith5552","studioAT","mintonmedia","gwnightscream","grunin","tedg","Dozermelon","Mickey Knox"],"review-date":["27 May 2005","5 February 2001","11 July 2000","9 July 2000","12 February 2007","18 August 2000","7 December 2001","30 July 2000","1 April 2007","13 July 2001","27 March 2002","1 August 2000","26 July 2000","29 April 2001","14 July 2000","5 July 2000","21 July 2000","14 August 2001","21 June 2014","23 June 2000","11 February 2017","3 July 2000","19 December 2000","24 January 2005","19 December 2000"],"review-rating":["6","6","7","8","10","10","10","9","3","8","10","1","1","1","1","7","3","6","6","6","10","6"],"review-title":[" This could have been much worse\n"," I liked it more than I expected to\n"," No kidding - I loved it!\n"," The Kid In Us All...\n"," The Kid The Man The Girl,oh and don't forget Chester !\n"," So..what's keeping them from making more like this?\n"," Bruce Willis in a good feel good movie.\n"," not just a kid movie\n"," Starts Off Cute, Then Gets Ugly\n"," profound,amazing\n"," For all the cynics out there.\n"," This film is not for kids, but rather for the kid in us.\n"," A surprisingly good movie; better than \"Armageddon\"\n"," Pretty Flubbery\n"," Tired plot.
