{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0734569/reviews"],"review-text":["For those curious, this episode is based in theme upon Pirandello's play, \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\" and Jean-Paul Sartre's play, \"No Exit\" (as indicated most obviously by its title), but, of course, with a Sterling twist. Five very different individuals find themselves in a round room with no idea who they are other than the indication of their attire. A bell intermittently rings (perhaps also a Hemmingway allusion?), increasing the agony of their incarceration. The newcomer to the group, a Major, is determined to escape, while the others are resigned to their fate. Unlike Pirandello, these characters don't even have a story. They have nothing other than the experience of the room in their consciousness, and no one to author their nonexistent story, so their position is even more hopeless than the characters in Pirandello's piece. Unlike both Pirandello and Sartre, there is no relationship involved between the characters and therefore no real conflict between them, though the theme of personal responsibility versus apathy is prominent in this story. Though this diverges significantly from the storyline of the authors alluded to in the title, themes of Sartre and Pirandello (and many other authors of the twentieth century) come through with absolute clarity. This is very obviously a piece which addresses post-modernist perspective in the context of the Cold War era. There is also an emphasis upon issues of personal insignificance. This is easily one of the best episodes I've seen, and still exceptionally relevant to current experience (as are Sartre and Pirandello). Exactly what makes a good piece of writing into a classic.","I will never forget the utterly absorbing effect this show had on me when I saw it for the first time. From the moment that the Major is startled by the Clown, to his anguished attempts to make sense of the situation ( \" We're alive, we're people, we must have memories!\" inexact quote but close), to his clever attempt to improvise a means of escape, this is riveting drama.Little touches stay with the viewer for a long time after watching it. The moment when the lovely ballerina dances for everyone, to the off key, screeching bagpipes of the Scottish musician; the Tramp's wistful remark, \" A miss is as good as a mile\", the Major's shaken conclusion that they must be in Hell.This is a brilliant episode, beautifully written and acted. The breathtaking beauty of Susan Harrison adds to the memorability of the strange, touching story.","This is one of the classic TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, where with the simplest of situations the viewer was drawn into a seemingly symbolic conflict, only to find the solution surprising and strangely acceptable. Five figures are inside a container/prison: a Major, a ballerina, a bagpiper, a clown, and a tramp. They are certainly an odd choice of types to be in this isolation chamber, but they are all in it (nevertheless) and they are trying to figure out why they are there. What have they in common? None can figure it out. But gradually the Major organizes them into working to bet out by standing on each other's shoulders. And the Major, going to the top of the line of figures does reach the entrance, and .... I'll leave it like that, although one of the other critiques on this thread actually gives the story away.The title seems to be suggested by SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR, Pirandello's famous play. Whether the actual purpose to the show was to spoof that play is questionable: Pirandello's characters analyze their roles and relations with each other. But the five characters here, while they try to understand their situation, are totally in the dark - they are not in the situation of the six characters in Pirandello who know their current situations. This uncertainty of what is going on allows the viewers to think it is an abstract drama.The actors, William Windon as the Major and Murray Mattheson as the Clown in particular, give good accounts of themselves. And the conclusion, whether planned as a spoof or not, is quite effective.","\"Five Characters In Search of An Exit\" clearly has to be one of the more clever and better \"Twilight Zone\" episodes ever made because of it's abstract ideas and thoughtful plan where the characters have to search to discover identity and it ends as a surprise. You have a military major, a female dancer, bag pipe player, a clown, and hobo who all awake together in the bottom of a wall and none know how they got there and they don't know who they are. So the episode starts out with very interesting drama and suspense from the very beginning making it so soul searching for the viewers interest to want to know the characters true identity and backgrounds. Plus the episode even adds more intrigue for the fact it places different types of characters with different views and lifestyles all with one goal in common to escape and find identity, and peace that's very compelling for the viewer. Only in the end I don't want to spoil for those who haven't seen a surprise fall happens! Proving that many times you might want to stay where you are away in your little sheltered world and be away from the masses of other people's world as you will see the characters are loved in a different way by people in a much different form. Really great and cleverly done a real shock twist surprise that makes the viewer see the unexpected and cruel fate that happens sometimes when you search and seek.","As with many episodes of The Twilight Zone, there's the 'surface' story that most viewers appear to enjoy and understand for the irony of the twist ending. Then there's the sub-text message that a more careful screening manages to unravel. I think Serling is making a direct attack here on the danger of falling victim to herd mentality. He does this by introducing the Major (William Windom) at the beginning of the story. As the other characters come together, they seem resigned to their fate of remaining trapped in their cylindrical prison. It's only the Major, freshly introduced as a new character in their presence (we find out how and why later) who challenges the Clown's (Murray Matheson) insistence that trying to escape would be 'exerting themselves for nothing'. Gradually winning them over to his point of view, the players make a stab at freedom, only to be frustrated once more. The message is that it's better to try and fail than to not try at all, with success measured by one's insistence on maintaining self awareness and free will against daunting odds. It's a timeless message that Serling returns to again and again, sometimes subtle (#2.7 - Nick of Time) and sometimes more obvious (#2.22 - The Obsolete Man). Even though Serling seemed to get repetitious with his themes from time to time, it was with a firm conviction that each person alive was the master of his own fate and entrusted with personal responsibility to make full use of his talents.","While researching Susan Harrison (The Ballerina) in reference to a Bonanza Episode, I was reminded of this gem.This episode is the inspiration for Dylan's \"All Along the Watch Tower\" (Hendrix's cover is probably as well know and is one of his best) which is one of HIS best.Thus this episode is responsible for several 'bests' - not bad for approximately 22 minutes of television.But this is \"The Twilight Zone\". Further comment of the series is unnecessary.'5 Characters' is typical Serling. Intense, dramatic, barreling toward an end that is as inevitable in hindsight as it is surprising the first time you see it.This episode is spoiled in one sentence and is too good to spoil for any who have not seen it.But you will feel ambushed. And you will never listen to Hendrix with the same ears again.","It seems there are two kinds of people in the world: those who think that \"Five Characters\" is one of the best episodes in the series and those who are so cool that they know it sucked because they were so clever and already predicted the \"lame\" twist at the end (which apparently, in their small minds, is the only reason the Twilight Zone exists: to come up with twists).There are plenty of lame episodes in the series and I'm not one to rate all TZ episodes ten. But this one is certainly one of those that merit such a rating. It is claustrophobic and colorful. The suspense is built up and we cannot wait for the reveal of the secret at the end. But whatever that secret is, what these people are, it doesn't really matter. Most of the beauty of the episode is to lead up to that. It would be just as powerful if we never find out what these strangers in a strange place really are.","William Windom(The Major), Murray Matheson(The Clown), Susan Harrison(The Ballerina), Kelton Garwood(The Tramp), and Clark Allen(The Bagpipe Player) play the five title characters, who find themselves prisoners in a vast cylindrical object with no way out but straight up, and no idea how they got there, or indeed who they are. The Major becomes the driving force in their effort to escape by forming a human ladder, and manages to get over the top with an unexpected outcome... Well remembered episode is really an existentialist play that still holds up marvelously today, with what must have been a stunning surprise ending that still packs a punch...if it hasn't been spoiled beforehand of course!","This one will either delight you or drive you crazy, or quite possibly both. William Windom plays the Major with no memory of who he is (the actor was brilliant in the Serling scripted 'They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar' in 'Night Gallery') and searching for his identity. He is confined in the austere setting of four high walls and the first person he meets to converse with is a Clown with a flower in his hat and a similar identity crisis. The Ballerina is played by Susan Harrison (from 'The Sweet Smell of Success') with a serene and dreamy quality.The fun is to escape the 21st century for a while to enjoy the mysterious appeal of this puzzling TZ entry. You might be groaning a little at the end - but wasn't it fun to guess along with the characters?","This Twilight Zone story begins with a somewhat disheveled William Windom in the uniform and rank of an army major finding himself in a cylindrical type room with no apparent entrance or exit save a hole where the roof should be. He finds he's not alone though, there's quite a motley crew in there with him. Susan Harrison a ballerina, Murray Matheson a clown, Kelton Garwood a tramp, and Clark Allen a bagpiper.The others seem curiously resigned to this prison they find themselves in. But Windom being a military man knows his duty is to escape. He devises a way, but when one of them reaches the top and sees what's out there beyond this room, it's quite the shock.It will be one for the viewer as well. We might very well be ourselves what these characters are in a much larger scale.","This entry in the \"Twilight Zone\" series has to be ranked in the top five and maybe even Number One. It's the most baffling of all the stories and the ending is nearly impossible to predict. The \"Five Characters in Search of an Exit\" awaken in some kind of spheric cylinder but have no recollection of how they got there or who they are. They have no history and they don't even feel any hunger or thirst. William Windom, who wears the uniform of an army major, decides to take charge of the group and try to find a way out of their nightmarish dilemma. His four distressed mates include a ballerina (Susan Harrison), a bemused clown (Murray Matheson), a tramp and a bagpiper. Although at first they try to discourage him, Windom presses on with his search for an exit and eventually enlists the help of the others. To complicate matters, a loud clanging bell shakes the very foundation of the cylinder, driving the five characters nearly to madness and thwarting their efforts to escape. At one point, Windom surmises that they're really in Hell and all hope is lost. It's only a momentary lapse on his part, however, as he soon continues his quest for the truth.Rod Serling's teleplay (taken from a short story by Marvin Petal) is one of his best and the cast does it justice. The \"Five Characters\" have no identity yet, but it's only temporary. Serling's point is that there's little difference between his \"Characters\" and the rest of humanity. In his concluding epilogue, series host Rod Serling assures viewers that these lost souls are on their way to new lives.","During the Sci-Fi TZ marathon of January 31, 1999, this episode was the last one aired in the 20th century in my time zone(Eastern). It was New Year's Eve, and when the clown starts singing, \"We're here because we're here, because we're here, because we're here...\" I realized that this was TZ's clever nod to it being New Year's Eve because that tune is also the tune to Old Lang Syne. Coincidence? We will never know.I love this story for the little touches: The tear on the ballerina, the antics of the clown, and the hit-yourself-in-the-head ending. This and the Art Carney Santa TZ are the only ones that are about Christmas. My personal top five episodes, after Five Characters...: 1. The Hunt 2. The After Hours 3. The Hitchhiker 4. The Lonely 5. Little Girl Lost","It's always enjoyable to see the way that Rod Serling and his team could make something out of almost nothing. In this instance, an Army major wakes up in a tall cylindrical vessel with no memory of who he is or how he got there. There is no way out of the vessel, either for him or for his four companions who have found themselves in the same boat -- a bagpiper, a bum, a clown, and a ballerina. They feel neither hunger nor thirst but they still try to get out and find out what the hell is going on. Oh, they try! They bang on the walls, try to slash the metal cylinder, and stand on each other's shoulder in an attempt to reach the top. The Army major finally makes it over the top of their trap but it's unclear whether he's able to tell the others what he's discovered or, in fact, whether he's discovered anything at all.But questions like \"What's it all about?\" and \"Why am I here?\" have no answers anyway. These five figures are ontological in the sense that they're aware of themselves, and the questions they're asking are ontological questions that have no answers. The Major at least takes the lead in asking an ontic question: \"How do we get out of this prison?\" That, apparently, has an answer.Now, personally, if I had been the Major I'd have settled down and accepted my fate and, after a suitable period, asked the ballerina to teach me some steps. That is, presuming she knows some. Her arms seem stuck in the first position. No, really. I happened to have studied dance in college and discovered that I was extremely good at falling down.When you get right down to it, the ballerina isn't that unattractive either. She's played by Susan Harrison, who was Burt Lancaster's younger sister in \"Sweet Smell of Success.\" On the other hand, it must be admitted that an eternity spent in a metal cylinder without access to a mom-and-pop made pizza with double topping can be a flawed eternity.","I'll keep it short. So no - unlike all the other reviews above - unnecessary summary of the story, presuming that the reader already watched the episode.On the one had, this is a very well written episode, with great mystery and a great climax. And that tear rolling over the cheek of the ballerina is a great touch. The most impressive aspect of this episode is the setting; it's comparable to the philosophy of Satre, and Rod Serling obviously knows that, because the characters talk about 'the essence of truth'.For these reasons alone, besides the great acting, is the episode a must-see for all TZ fans.On the other hand, was the same ending also kind of predictable. Within the first five minutes I thought the characters could be toys/dolls, and they are stuck in a toy-box of some kind. Moreover, the fact that the characters come up with the plan to reach the top of the wall after (a seemingly endless) 15 minutes, is just wearisome. Although it does make space for some interesting dialog, it feels like they are stretching time for the episode.Don't miss it, but don't expect to much of it...","Five colorful individuals find themselves trapped in a small room. Although they don't exactly know who they are, they are nonetheless determined to escape from their little prison. Director Lamont Johnson relates the absorbing story at a steady pace, builds a good deal of claustrophobic tension, and adroitly crafts an intriguing mysterious atmosphere. Rod Serling's thoughtful and compelling script ingeniously covers the basic human need for identify as well as the equally basic human desires for both freedom and to be loved by someone else. Moreover, it's superbly acted by a top-notch cast: William Windom as a take-charge ramrod army major, lovely Susan Harrison as a sweet ballerina, Murray Matheson as a boisterous clown, Kelton Garwood as a forlorn tramp, and Clark Allen as a resigned bagpipe player. The surprise twist ending is a real doozy. A terrific episode.","This is without a doubt the best episode of all the twilight zones.Murray Matheson gave the performance of his life. His wit was so outstanding, and showed what a great actor can do in such a short amount of time. This episode has what everyone wants in life. To know who you really are. William Windom as the Major was wonderful, while the other characters had resigned to their circumstances, he would not let them give up until at least one of them got out. The Major explained to them that they had to belong to someone. This episode has you wanting the characters to escape to the very end. But for a lot of us there is no real escape. Brilliant acting and dialogue all around.","\"Five Characters in Search of an Exit\" has to be one of the most boring \"Zones\" ever made. It was on Sci-Fi this morning, and, as usual, I changed the channel. I put it in my Top Five list of the worst \"Zones\" ever produced. Dull and predictable, and not worth watching. Serling worked this theme to death (earthlings in the hands of aliens, who often were giants), and in this particular version, it just doesn't work. Anyone who hasn't seen it before, will quickly figure it out. This is another Serling philosophical mood piece, perhaps paralleling the plight of those in prisoner of war or concentration camps, where the imprisoned may lose interest in finding out where they are or fighting their captors. William Windom, as the soldier who is the last to \"drop in\" is the only one curious to make the effort, and it doesn't take long to figure the outcome.","I guess by the time I saw this episode, I had seen enough Twilight Zones to have it figured out ahead of time. There is this odd assemblage of characters who find themselves at the bottom of a cylinder. They are fine until an overzealous soldier shows up in their midst. It is his prime directive to escape and so he garners the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder. There is much discussion about purpose and reason and speculation on their pasts, but no one can remember anything. They represent different jobs: a piper, a ballerina, a clown, a man in a tattered hat. Why are they there? It leads to an adventure and is resolved at the end, but I guess I had a pretty good idea before it all happened.","The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology about it--much like Star Trek. That's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner. They are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. Because of this, a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now, it's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone.Now I was very surprised when I saw reviews for this bland episode that described it as being \"among the best\" and gave it scores of 10. If this is the case, then why is it that everyone I know who has seen this episode hates it as much as I do? It's possible that me and my family and friends are all cranks but it's also possible this is yet another case of rabid fans rabidly inflating the rating on an average or below average episode.The episode itself stars William Windom and others as various archetypes--a soldier, a dancer, etc. They are all stuck in a cylindrical room with no escape and only at the end do you realize the \"shocking truth\"--which isn't at all shocking and is in fact majorly lame. No, this is a badly written and unengaging episode. Yes, there were plenty of episodes of the series that deserved a 10, but few as undeserving as this one due to a shallow script and an unappealing resolution.","I watched this episode with high hopes after seeing it on so many people's \"Favourite episodes\" list. I'm not boasting in any way, but from the start, I realised they were in some sort of toybox/can, with the huge eye looking down on them, to the type of characters in there. Even though throughout the episode, the questions of \"Who are we?\", \"Where are we?\", \"What's outside?\" carry the suspense of the episode (which I unfortunately already figured out), I must say that different types of characters and the interaction between them did make the episode interesting enough. Although the twist of the story may have been harder to guess if ALL of them were (toy) soldiers."],"review-user":["lady-rhianna","mlraymond","theowinthrop","blanbrn","classicsoncall","Brandon-161","tonycom5","AaronCapenBanner","darrenpearce111","bkoganbing","chuck-reilly","judstrom","rmax304823","basanakin","Woodyanders","dejelm2","donnielee46","Hitchcoc","MartinHafer","cltdreamer"],"review-date":["7 August 2007","9 January 2007","22 October 2006","12 November 2007","21 May 2010","2 June 2006","7 May 2009","28 October 2014","11 November 2013","27 May 2014","3 March 2008","14 August 2009","26 March 2013","15 January 2011","20 April 2018","21 July 2016","19 April 2009","25 November 2008","9 September 2007","30 May 2009"],"review-rating":["9","10","10","10","7","10","10","10","8","6","10","9","7","8","9","10","1","7","3","4"],"review-title":[" One of Sterling's best, inspired by archetype, the era, and classics\n"," Fascinating, thoughtful drama of unusual group of prisoners determined to escape\n"," Life inside an abstract prison\n"," One of the best episodes of the series, character and identity searching and very cleverly done.\n"," \"No one gets out until one of us gets out!\"\n"," One of the best episodes\n"," One of the Best\n"," Can't Beat That Title\n"," Where Do They All Belong?\n"," His duty is to escape\n"," \"Five Characters...\" is top-notch entry in series\n"," Saw it as a kid; of course I will revere it forever.\n"," Lemme Outta Here!\n"," Entertaining/wearisome episode\n"," Who are we?\n"," Best Episode of the Twilight Zone\n"," In My Top 5 List - of \"Zones\" I Don't Watch...\n"," Hard to Forget, But....\n"," Dull and not particularly entertaining\n"," The twist wasn't a twist for me\n"]}
