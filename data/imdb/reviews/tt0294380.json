{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0294380/reviews"],"review-text":["I agree with the leading notes, this is a splendid film, and remarkably well balanced when one considers the side tracks that could have been taken. All the performances are fine, particularly that by James Franco as Danny, who's convincing despair at having found love and lost it so quickly (and so violently) is very moving. Apart from his good looks, he essays considerable depth of character that should take him a long way as an actor. Only the ending was somewhat frustrating. It was too rushed, as if once the shooting was over, so was the film. I had become so immersed in Danny's story a little more fleshing out would have helped, for he did go through a visceral experience and lost his first love. To have him happily turning up back at school as if nothing had happened was simply unbelievable. Nonetheless, this is an excellent and mysterious thriller. Perhaps a little too ambiguous for the huge cinema audience that has been fed on pap for so long. I hope it does well, and I sure hope it makes it to DVD as soon as possible.","Films belonging to the \"film noir\" genre usually contain similar elements: a \"deus ex machina\" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert.  Think \"High Sierra\" or \"White Heat.\"There is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there.  But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that \"Blind Spot\" belongs to.  The film follows Danny Alton, a troubled teenager (superbly played with depth, grace, emotional integrity and downright plaintiveness by James Franco, who throws himself completely into this role) who has fallen in love with the rough-edged streetkid, Darcy.From the beginning, you know this is going to be bad.Darcy invites Danny to his house. But the house is empty and for sale, and a bloody check for thousands of dollars is on the floor. Danny is robbed of his clothing and possessions, but uses the check to track down the suicidal April -- Darcy's other lover. When they reach Darcy's real home, they find Wayne -- a thug hunting Darcy down for the money he's stolen.  Together, the three manage to locate Darcy in a dusty, run-down motel in the desert. But that's only the beginning of the tale, as plastic explosives, drugs, gun-running, a creepy funeral home, bisexual assassins and a lonely half-finished house in the desert bring events to an explosive head in an alley outside a tattoo parlor in Los Angeles.This film contains some of the best noir cinematography I have seen in years.  In one scene, Danny races on foot through the desert to the half-finished house in the desert where he believes Darcy may have been taken that evening by mobsters.  A very long shot with sharp lighting effects shows Danny -- arms and legs flailing, palpable fear etched on his face (visible even at this distance), dust cloud trailing behind him as the wind whips in his direction -- racing across the desert flats toward the house.  The loneliness, the desperation, the despair Danny feels is shocking depicted.  There are many such scenes in this film, wonderfully crafted by the experienced Maximo Munzi.  This is Oscar-winning material.The editing, too, is just astounding.  The film contains little moments where the characters gain insight into themselves or their situation. Bits of time, where memory and feeling come flooding back.  At these times, quick montages of images flash across the screen.  This is superb editing by director-writer-editor Stephan Woloszczuk.  In one early montage, Danny describes the wondrous feelings he has now that Darcy has entered his life. Quick images of Danny's diary flash across the screen: the words \"4 life,\" \"lucky\" and \"safe\" stop momentarily, while page upon page of words, the contents of a human heart, race across the screen -- out of focus, too quick to read.  It's like the flood of emotion Danny himself feels.The flood of images reveals something else about this film:  Just how beautiful Nathaniel Waters' production design is.  Darcy's quonset-hut home is the perfect match of high-tech and slob (a tribute to the attentiveness of set decorator Kimberly Foster).  The stunning desert house scene is just outright creepy.  The ruined motel where Darcy hides out can be found in any abandoned small town in America.  The creepy (and astoundingly lit) funeral home where the plot takes a horrific turn mixes starkness with the pall of death hanging over the entire film.  (It's too bad the film's lighting director is not credited.)  This film has a superb production design, one that enhances every single frame and every actor's performance.That's the fourth element of this film which makes it grab you and hold on to you:  The acting.  James Franco is a superb actor.  Even in \"Spider-Man\" -- where he was given practically nothing to do -- Franco showed that he understands human emotion like no other actor of his generation.  He's no pretty-boy coasting on his good looks like Brad Pitt.  Franco portrays deep emotion with full force.  His performances contain pure human heart. Consider the scene in the phone booth outside the funeral home, where Danny collapses after telling April and Wayne that Darcy is dead.  Lesser actors couldn't carry off the complete emotional breakdown of a human being. Franco does.Shawn Montgomery, in her first film, simply blows you away with her performance as the suicidal April.  Deeply in love with Darcy, suffering from massive depression after having to bury alone her unborn child (after the fetus spontaneously aborts) in a perfume box in the woods, her life of luxury and perfection now a shambles:  April is one of the best-drawn characters on film that I have ever seen.  While Danny's relationship to Darcy is slowly teased out during the film, April's nervous breakdown is revealed only to the audience.  Neither Danny nor Wayne seem particularly interested in her as a human being.  April's despair when she realizes Danny has also been Darcy's lover is poignant and potent, even if it is truncated by the character's complete inability to feel any emotion for very long now. Montgomery brings to April a pathos that puts your heart through the wringer.Mark Patrick Gleason is given the hardest job in the film:  Having to make something human and real out of the thug, Wayne.  At first, Wayne is simply one of any number of violent, foul-mouthed, obsessed drug-pushers/gun-runners that appears in any number of films (from \"Kindergarten Cop\" to \"Beverly Hills Cop 2\").  Gleason does very well with what he's given, but he doesn't quite get to where you feel much for Wayne.  It's difficult to say whether this is Gleason's problem or the material's.  There is one moment -- where Wayne (who is Darcy's brother, although neither Danny nor April know this) reads Danny's diary and realizes the sexual and emotional link between the two men -- where you just know that Wayne is going to go homophobic on Danny's ass.  But the explosion never comes.  (Thank god! Trite plots are death to film noir.)  Once the revelation about the siblings comes at the film's end, the audience is fairly astounded to realize the depth of love and compassion Wayne truly felt for Darcy -- so deep that Wayne accepted Danny's homosexual love for his bisexual brother.  But this all happens off-screen.  Gleason is never given a chance to act out Wayne's feelings. It must have been very frustrating for the performer.The story is rather inventive, although the smuggling device seen at the end of the film is likely to remind viewers of \"Diamonds Are Forever\" (yes, James Bond).  A traditional narrative voice-over (which proves Franco is as great a voice talent as he is a physical actor) provides terrific atmosphere, although it does tend to flow over into schmaltz a few times toward the end of the film (providing some unintentional laughter). Terrific locales play key visual roles in the film.  Kudos to the location scout for finding such astounding buildings!  The end of the film struck me as a bit rushed; not pat, but a little too firm for my film noir tastes.Now, I've seen audiences either hate or love \"Blind Spot.\"  Modern film audiences, exposed to the most extreme brutality and violence, often have little appreciation for the subtleties of film noir.  My suggestion is to take a small group of friends who don't see despair, emotional collapse, desperation or depression as laughable.  Take them to a small theater, where they can glory in the spectacle of the film's vision, but where their viewing won't be ruined by a crowd of people who won't recognize good film noir.  Get them some popcorn (trust me, they'll be so engrossed they won't finish it), get them a soda, and let them be overwhelmed.  Go some place bright and cheery afterward, to wash the grime and awfullness out of your soul.  Because this film is so good at making you feel, you'll need that restorative.","    Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT.BLINDSPOT'S diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting  journey to the core of the human soul.  As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors.   With superb editing, especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end.  A thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.What an  astounding accomplishment for Stephan Woloszczuk.  Cheers Stephan! Angela Sander","I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy. I never heard of the actors before but I liked all three very much. I think they did a terrific job on their journey to self-discovery. All in all, this is an amazingly cool and suspenseful suspenseful film. I still carry many of the images in my mind.","\"Blind Spot\" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love. There is a dreamlike quality to several sequences and the images are saturated with an eerie sense of tension. Strange. Suspenseful. Beautiful to look at. Definitely worth seeing. I really would like to see it again. Periodically I check to see if Blind Spot has been distributed. I can't wait to see the film again in the cinema or on DVD.Davide Pepe 13/08/2005 Bologna - Italy","I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time. The mood of the desert floods everywhere and even the scenes filmed in the streets of Los Angeles or San Francisaco seem to be a natural extension of it. The story rides you smoothly through all these beautiful settings to lead you to a bitter-sweet ending, being the perfect climax for this perfect journey. The construction of the film itself is a master craft. The skilled use of innovative resources (like stills stitching Danny's memories into the film) will compare to those hand-made pieces of work so rare and so enjoyable. Blind Spot achieves to capture the essence of the desert taking you to an universal common ground where anyone of us can feel being both discoverer and native.","When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How it's possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!!!Please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!! This is really a very great movie that people should see and it deserve another chance!!!!!! Edvard","James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words. The tone is everything. He carries it through the action and suspense as well as the grim bits of gallows humor. I like the other two actors a great deal too. The blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his twisted tough guy stoicism. Some of the thugs seemed a little sketchy but this is a mini-point really. The film is totally solid and Franco is way cool all around.","Blind Spot's images are great. The action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heart-wrenching. The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this film. It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.","It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances. Naive schoolboy, suicidal blonde, embittered car thief -- all converge with unexpected twists. Together they create an explosive portrait of fractured love -- one that unwittingly conspires to mend amidst the hardest forms of adversity and illusion -- the blindness of human emotion.","I can't get this flick off my brain. It's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. I've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. It's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. Franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave. I guess some politically correctos won't appreciate the vibe (don't bring your grandma) but it is totally awesome. The thing that's best is the kaliedescope style. There is some really serious stuff mixed with super interesting footage of the road. The movie really makes you sad and scared in parts but it also spins your head with what is happening and the way it is filmed. WTF is up with the world? Sooo many critics are raving about all these supposedly revolutionary ground-breaking films and when you see them they're boring and predictable and not-all-that. I don't get it because there are a lot of other better choices. Blind Spot is really kinda great because it gives you thrills and chills and major upcoming star power but does it in a way that is completely fresh and definitely totally rad.","Saw this as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I hope they got better movies than this, because this film failed to deliver on any of the hopes that audience may have entertained, from the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt, down to more simple wishes, such as decent acting, coherent direction, character development, or actual production values. Plagued by film school effects such as freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress, and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2, this film failed on almost every level to engage the audience. After the first twenty minutes of valiantly trying to take it seriously, the audience collectively threw up it's hands and just started to enjoy the inherent crappiness of the film. I could be upset that I paid nine bucks to see it, and it was two hours I'll never get back, but on the other hand, it was an entertaining two hours I'll never get back. This would have been a classic Mystery Science 3000 episode."],"review-user":["mccarthyos","tevanson","angelasander","ALEJIXER","davide93","bast_sejmet","edvarddoling","dustykrane","ella1980","info-6876","duboisgabr","dcscifigirl"],"review-date":["24 February 2004","24 October 2003","17 October 2004","11 October 2005","13 August 2005","27 November 2005","18 March 2010","18 January 2006","3 January 2006","16 December 2005","8 January 2006","24 October 2003"],"review-rating":["9","10","10","10","10","10","9","10","10","10","1"],"review-title":[" Wonderfully impressed by this mysterious thriller and the acting of James Franco\n"," Terrific film noir, with outstanding cinematography and editing!
