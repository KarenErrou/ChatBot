The film shows the political riots who took place in Gothenburg in 2001 from a new perspective. It features interviews with those who were convicted where those people gets the first chance after the riots, to tell their side of the story and why they think the world can be a so much better place to live in and be a part of. I react emotionally when I see this, since I just feel so mad about how those people were treated both during the riots but also after the riots.I hope as many as possible gets to see this movie, as it really gets your mind thinking: Is this possible? In Sweden, a democracy, in 2001?","This documentary focuses on the happenings in Gothenburg 2001. In swedish media the demonstrators where pictured as criminals that stood for anarchy and violence. This movie shows that there not, actually they are intelligent, articulate people that has something to say - And says it by the force of bricks. They believe in a better world, a world where people can think and say what they want - without being aimed at. But are their beliefs of having the possibility of changing the society realistic? I think not.This documentary gives us enlightenment in the issues of greed, capitalism and the future it might bring. It is a great documentary that is not propaganda, because it is not shown as what they say is right. Everything it shows is what some individuals think and it is up to the viewer to decide if what they do and stand for is right or wrong.I have heard many people that labels this a propaganda and therefor chooses not to view it, I think they are making a bad decision because even if you sympathize with the police or the demonstrators belief, all you get is more facts to rely on, for example the kid that got shoot says that he thinks that it is good to throw a brick through a McDonalds window because it is the step between thinking and acting as you think.Overall this movie freaked me out because you cannot really dismiss the facts that the few policemen, that fought violence with violence, did not get convicted or even detained in custody even however the proof of them throwing bricks at the demonstration march (and in some cases beating people with truncheon, even though they are lying on the street without making resistance) where as good as it gets.Rating: 8/10 - Very good, but not best!","In this film Swedish filmmakers Stefan Jarl and Lukas Moodysson let some of the kids that were convicted after the riots in Gothenburg in June 2001 tell their side of the story. Through in depth interviews these convicted youngsters give their view on globalisation and capitalism. For the first time after the riots those who were convicted gets the chance to tell why they feel that another world is possible and that they feel that everyone can do something about it. These youngsters are not terrorists, they are just people who is convinced that the world can be a better place to live in. That's why they took matters into their own hands. Jarl and Moodysson's film is important and give new light on the riots in Gothenburg as well as the issues concerning globalisation. I don't feel that the film should treat these issues objective. Objectivity is impossible, just look at the daily flow of news.","Jarl and Moodysson are part of an dying breed of political film makers. The Swedish population should appreciate that they try to uncover the truth when the government and media actively distorts and cover up the events surrounding the EU meeting in Gothenburg. It is absolutely heartbreaking to see how these innocent kids have been abused and drugged by the Swedish police and convicted to prison in political trials for sending text messages and as revenge for others actions. The only unfortunate thing about this movie is that it will not reach the broad masses in Sweden as it will only be shown it theaters and not be released on video or aired on television.The political film is important as it can bring new perspectives and insight into complex issues and has a role to play as an educator of the masses.","At times, the mainstream news media seems to be driven by a bunch of no-brain reporters. In that they just listen to each other and report what others report. This documentary shows what can be found if some more effort is put into the task of reporting about something. True journalism should be about providing the people with different perspectives on things that happen so that they have a fair chance of creating an own opinion. This documentary together with mainstream media reports, will help you with this. At least for me, it provided a lot of relevant information regarding the purpose/motivation behind the nowadays frequent world-wide protests at different political summits.","This is an awful movie. They take criminals and thugs who uses violence and they throw rocks at the police. But instead of being looked upon as criminals and thieves. The video maker tries to make freedom heroes out of a bunch of young and naive kids whom read the communist manifesto. This is nothing but a communist propaganda movie. The message is clear, violence is good as long as it comes from this disenfranchised youth. Despite they live in Sweden and have all the money and time in the world to make something of their lives instead they are influenced by this retard propaganda. The kids hero is this guy who throws rocks at the police and he gets shot in the back? How can throwing rocks at policemen be a good act? No the policemen aren't' humans in this documentary, they are just a force of evil, protectors of a capitalist society. This is a documentary about bratty kids that blame the elite for all their faults and they use violence to get their points across. Shameful.","Starting with a tearjerking poem and images of american missiles, starving children and mutilated palestinians I quickly realised that this was not going to be a objective documentary. 5 youths convicted after the gothenburg riots are interviewed and give a very confused explaination why they had to trash the citycenter and then (oh my god) actually have pay for what they have done. I kept watching and many questions are raised, were the trial properly done and did the cops have the right to do what they did? Lots of questions asked... and then dropped. No interviews with judges or going through documents about the trial.. nothing.In short: Nothing new from what every Swede has seen on tv a hundred times - just poor propaganda."],"review-user":["scobbah","ziikay","marcolof","fredrik_aaland","holgernisse","jim_ruuth","prohibited-name-1495"],"review-date":["23 April 2004","30 December 2003","27 September 2003","14 May 2004","15 May 2004","2 December 2017","23 July 2003"],"review-rating":["10","8","9","10","1","2"],"review-title":[" The convicted people from the riots in a new perspective\n"," Great and interesting documentary\n"," Important and worth considering\n"," A great insight into what it is like to live in a modern police state\n"," Necessary complement to mainstream media \"objectivity\"\n"," The Gothenburg riots - The communist version\n"," blurry propanda\n"]}
