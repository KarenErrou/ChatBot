{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362478/reviews"],"review-text":["Richard Kelly's latest supernatural thriller \"The Box\" is creepy, strange and overall sinister, yet not very coherent or focused. One's opinion on the movie depends on whether one accepts its peculiar concept or not. I must say that I was initially enthralled by the movie's strange old-fashioned tone resembling sci-fi movies from the 1970s Kelly pays homage to. The movie handles its mystery rather well with Frank Langella's uniquely scary performance being the obvious highlight. Given that, the movie falters at the end when its otherwise intriguing concept gets bogged down by the series of ridiculous events that feel as if they were taken from a different movie. While The Box tends to approach the wrong territory and is rather unfocused, one can't help but acknowledge Kelly's ability to attract the viewer's attention. His obsessions may not be shared by very many people, but he manifests them in a richly textured manner. That's just enough to enjoy this movie despite its shortcomings. 6.5/10 (B-)","In the winter of 1967, Professor Charles Goetzinger conducted an experiment in his Basic Persuasion Class, hiring an actor to attend all his classes wearing a large black bag. Strangely, after several days, the black bag began to inspire anger in the other students. Goetzinger's students would pick fights with, taunt and tease the black bag, seemingly unable to recognise that there was a human being within it.What Goetzinger's experiment showed was that anonymity loosens the restraints on aggressive behaviour, and that when victims are anonymous, and therefore dehumanised, it grows easier to commit violence against them. This echoes the countless bizarre reports of children at Disneyland striking hapless costumed characters for no apparent reason and why most movies, especially war movies, deindividualize the Other in an effort not to implicate their audiences.Richard Kelly's \"The Box\", which can be divided into three sections, deals with these themes, but goes a bit further. In its first section (lasting approximately 30 minutes) we have a fairly faithful retelling of \"Button, Button\", a Richard Matheson short story and \"Twilight Zone\" episode (1986). This section involves a couple (Norma and Arthur) who are given a box by a strange man named Steward. The box is equipped with one button, and should either Norma or Arthur push it, they will promptly be given a million dollars. The catch is, pressing the button results in someone they don't know immediately dying. Of course Norma pushes the button anyway. Why wouldn't she? The box facilitates disavowal. Modern man, though he knows his actions cause suffering, is himself increasingly isolated from the consequences of his choices.Steward gives Norma and Arthur their money and then leaves with the box, but not before ominously stating that the box will now be offered to \"someone whom you don't know\". Shocked, the couple suddenly realise that thousands of these boxes are around the country, everyone given the chance to make easy money at someone else's expense. Norma and Arthur, far from being suddenly wealthy, are now in mortal danger; they may be exploited by any number of button pushers around the world. The message: if everyone is willing to have others suffer in order to facilitate their own personal gains, then all is already lost, the film drawing broad parallels between capitalism, war, human nature, greed and violence.In the second part of the film, Kelly tells us that the boxes are really a test given to mankind by aliens. The aliens are gathering data, and if humans are found to be selfish and beyond redemption, they will destroy the planet. This is a classic flaw in science fiction films (\"Abyss\", \"The Day The Earth Stood Still\" etc), in which advanced beings \"teach us not to be violent\" by hypocritically \"threatening us with violence\". I call this \"Big stick diplomacy\", whereby a superpower negotiates peace whilst simultaneously threatening violence. Throw in a bunch of silly science fiction themes, worm holes, teleportation and the kind of apocalyptic pseudo-religious ending that ALL of Kelly's films have, and...well, let's just say Kelly sabotages his whole film with unnecessary mumbo jumbo.Luckily the third part of Kelly's film salvages everything. Early in the film Norma mentions Jean Paul Sartre. Later, Norma and Arthur go to a performance of Sartre's 1944 existentialist play, \"No Exit\", and find the words \"No Exit\" written on their car window. Sartre, of course, famously said in \"No Exit\" that \"Hell is other people\", the implication being that the earth is \"made hell\" because we become throwaway objects when in the gaze of others.More horrifically, modern man no longer has the ability to \"choose\" whether he presses the button or not. In the age of globalization, he has ceased to become a subject and is now a default participant. To escape the global system is to be free, but escape is impossible. This is partially why the film's aesthetic is labyrinthine and confusing, and wholly divorced from the cosy spaces of the 1986 Twilight Zone episode. Kelly recognises that Matheson's world is long gone. The system's labyrinthine tendrils criss-cross in all directions to such an extent that boxes and buttons are now continually overlapping and always unwittingly pressed. The film's way out of this gridlock is essentially what Godard espouses in \"Our Music\" (\"Who are you?\"), man encouraged to make empathetic connections born of mutual suffering, rather than either avoidance or blind tolerance.This notion of \"compassion born of mutual suffering\" is articulated at the end of the film, when Norma begins to identify with Steward. She has a mutilated foot and he has a mutilated face, and by recognising his pain and suffering she is able to regret having pushed the button.We then learn that \"The Box Test\" has a second phase. He who pushes the button must sacrifice themselves for their child, which of course is what Norma does. She allows herself to be shot so that her son may live. The implication is that whilst everyone on the planet has selfishly pressed the button, man is nevertheless inherently good enough to sacrifice himself for his fellowman.Cue cheesy CGI water, worm holes and silly baptism, purgatory and hell metaphors. Kelly's point: there is \"No Exist\", no escaping the world, only the fleeting chance of a kind of mutual empathy, a kind of heaven on earth.8/10 – Ignore what the film says about the acronym HREM. With the film constantly referencing X-rays, it means \"High Resolution Electron Microscopy\". IE – the box test is an X ray of humanity, the aliens trying to see what we're really like deep down inside.","After I heard how terrible this film was, I really wasn't expecting much. I almost didn't even rent it, but I am glad I did. I love Donnie Darko and I think with The Box, Kelly has gone back to the Darko style of writing and directing. I am not sure why it received so many bad reviews, maybe because like Donnie Darko it was too cerebral for the mainstream. It's not a movie you can do three things and watch, you have to pay attention to the little details. I do feel there are missing pieces that weren't explained, but that could be the way the film was edited and may come out later in a directors cut edition, or it could be Kelly's way of keeping the audience guessing. I can see how this movie wouldn't appeal to the masses, especially since it is a cautionary tale of morals and ethics, but if you liked Donnie Darko, you will probably enjoy The Box. I can see this having a cult following like Donnie Darko.Also I am not a Cameron Diaz fan, but I think she did a great job. I had heard awful things about her performance in this, but in my opinion this was one of her better roles.","This movie starts off with a couple waken up by the doorbell early in the morning. The woman Norma Lewis ( Cameron Diaz ) opens the door just to find out no one's at the door. But there is a mysterious box on the doorstep, and Norma brings it in. In the meanwhile Arhur Lewis ( James Marsden ) joins her at the diner table and together they unfold the wrapping paper to find a box with a big red button on top of it. On the box is a keyhole which needs a key to open up the top so you can press the button. They have no idea what it is or what it means but that will soon change.Later that day a mysterious creepy man is at the door, Norma opens the door and the man presents himself as Arlington Steward ( Frank Langella ). He is creepy in the sense that he has a big open burn mark on his face in the trend of Harvey Dent ( 2-face ) as seen in the Dark Knight. He will ask Norma if she received the box and will explain what it is. Mr. Steward gives Norma a key to open the box, and she can keep the key with the box for 24 hours, in that time she will have to make a special choice. If she will push the button, Steward will give the family a staggering 1 million dollars in cash BUT someone, somewhere in the world will die. To gain her trust Stewerd gives Norma a 100 dollar bill and leaves.So far so good, the first 30 minutes of this movie are good and interesting, and you will wonder what will happen if they press the button. The story has a great concept and is very promising.Unfortunately the movie collapse under it's own weight of complexity in the remaining 75 minutes or so. It's not because of bad acting, although Diaz is terrible, Marsden plays OK but not memorable and besides, Langella sticks out with head and shoulders. It's not bad directing either. I loved Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko so we're not dealing with a beginner. The Cinematography and camera-work is good and the atmosphere in the entire movie is really well done. It's just that the plot is turning out to be way to smart, but yet it feels dumb and clumsy. At moments the movie is very predictable, and sometimes you are scratching you'r head about what the hell just happened. You keep on watching because you'll expect that the movie will fall on it's place near the end. Unfortunately this is not happening and the movie ends with questions unanswered. Kelly is probably trying to create something that people will talk about after the movie and on birthdays. But to be honest I didn't care about the characters and the story no more, the last 20 minutes took forever and I remember asking my girlfriend if they could please get it over with.This movie is comparable to flavored chewing gum. It starts off with an explosion of flavor but as you keep on chewing the flavor is starting to go away and you end up with a dull tasteless piece of rubber in your mouth.","Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential. In The Box, the driving force of the narrative stems from a moral dilemma. Believe me when I say that I understand the inclination to compare an innovative filmmakers'movies by looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to approach each new film as a self contained entity first, and then broaden my gaze afterwards. The Box is one of those films you get mixed feelings about because it seems to be in some sort of identity crisis. It isn't always sure what it wants to be. The twists are numerous, but easy to follow if not to predict. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz play a relatively believable pair of newlyweds who are in financial straits. A Box containing a \"button unit\" arrives on their doorstep and they are informed by a horribly burned man that if pushed the button will cause the death of one person whom they don't know, and they will receive one million dollars. One of the things The Box achieves is to conjure up this invisible fear that somewhere out there our actions have moral consequences. Before the button is pushed it has an eerie and seductive quality, alluring yet sinister. Once it has been pushed, events are set in motion that make the two leads question their own morality and deeply regret their fateful decision. The notion that the Box is an experiment is interesting because for me it provides the movie with a paradox. If there are external beings developing an \"altruism coefficient\" based on data gathered by couples pushing and not pushing the button, then as the conspiracy unravels, we notice that ultimately it is a forced altruism: Be selfless or the species will be wiped out. I suppose the couples don't know the consequences of their actions when they are faced with making the decision, but they have no reason to suspect that The Box can do anything, so why would they choose altruistically? Is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care about it when presented with a problem in our own lives? The psychological hurdles in this movie are everywhere. Push the button or don't, it's likely someone is messing with you. Take the money or don't, no one gives anything away for free. Search for the truth, the answers you find slowly reveal your demise. I propose that The Box is an ironic work because it offers the false choice of free will while revealing that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes. You can only choose to be free at the expense of another's life, is that freedom? No, it is only another box because then you become trapped in the consequences of your own morality. There is no escape for us because we live on earth and that is another Box. This is precisely why the external beings in the film are ultimately antagonists. They demand we conform to moral standards which rob us of our freedom. We made it to Mars, and we were burned for it and turned into slaves in a sick game. The references to Jean Paul Sartre illustrate this point rather well. \"You can only enter the final chamber free, or not free.\" Sure, but no matter the form in which we enter the chamber, it is a chamber nonetheless. Trevor Nemeth","It seems that most either hate or love this film with nothing in between. I have seen people say it was \"hateful\" or \"they didn't understand the ending\" I will simply say, a number of people just did not understand the film at all.I personally thought it was better than Donnie Darko, as Kelly went out of his way to be weird for the sake of it in that film. This seemingly had a bit more meaning behind it.To those who found the script hateful, it simply isn't do not allow that opinion to keep you from watching this movie. If anything the script shows you that greed and the error of our ways do have consequences and could harm those we love. That isn't hateful, but more of a message alerting us that our every decision is indeed important.Do not be scared away by those who ranked the film at four and below, this is a movie for those who want to be challenged to think outside the normal boundaries of everyday thought. If you're up to that challenge it's worth seeing, although certain areas could be done better.It was nice to see Cameron do a serious role, but she did seem at times rusty at portraying some of the emotions needed for such a role. At others she nailed what she needed to deliver. James Mardsen (Arthur Lewis) and Frank Langella (Arlington Steward) both delivered consistent performances.","I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, \"Donnie Darko\" and \"Southland Tales,\" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see. I for one could only comprehend roughly 40% of what I saw on- screen, and even then it can only be called interpretation. So why did I give this movie a generous seven stars? Because for one, we get some spectacular performances (Marsden's great and Langella returns as a familiar creepy character), and most importantly two, because it's entirely original and Richard Kelly, undoubtedly one of the bravest directors alive, uses his creative vision to tell a story that dares to be different. Quite frankly, it's the ONLY way - only through Kelly's unique style could this story be told the way it's intended.In the end, if you're not willing to spend some serious thought into an intelligent movie (and even then it may all amount to nothing), stay FAR away from this one. But if you want to watch a deep, rich, complex and thought-provoking piece on spirituality, existentialism, and the predictability of human nature, go see this. Be prepared for lengthy discussions with your partner however.*Note: If by chance you've read this review, taken my recommendation, have actually seen the movie and STILL believe you've wasted 2 hours of your life, I'd be happy to share my views on the whole meaning and plot of the film. See, that's why I liked it so much - it promotes discussion! As hard as it is though, I'll try summing it up by paraphrasing a rather depressing quote by Langella's character, who explains the significance of the simple box to an employee: \"Your house is a box which you live in. The car that you drove to work is a box, on wheels. When you return home from work you sit in front of a box with moving images. You watch until the mind and soul rots and the box that is your body deteriorates, when finally you are placed into the ultimate box... to rest under the soil and earth.\"","As a fan of science fiction allegory, social experiment, \"The Twilight Zone\" and the thriller genre -- no less all those elements combined -- Richard Kelly and his film \"The Box\" should've at least won me over, but it doesn't. It can't even decide if it wants to remain completely mysterious or explicitly tell us what's going on and any film that has to contemplate that is too complex for its own good. With any story this daring, there's potential for something meaningful. \"The Box\" does let you glimpse it and draw a few interesting conclusions, but through intellectual jail bars placed before our eyes by the myriad of plot contrivances. In other words, too many plot elements exist in in the film that keep us from ever putting our mind around what Kelly is trying to say. Although he starts simply by focusing on a couple (James Marsden and Cameron Diaz) and their child making an ethical decision, the scope widens to include everything from Arthur C. Clarke references to mindless drones to some indiscernible notion of the afterlife.This beginning piece is based on Richard Matheson's story \"Button, Button,\" which was a short story turned into a \"Twilight Zone\" episode. In \"The Box,\" a mysterious man with a half-burned face played by Frank Langella drops off a box with a button in it at the doorstep of Norma and Arthur Lewis and their son Walter. He later comes back and gives Norma a proposition: don't press the button and nothing happens, or press the button and receive one million dollars and subsequently someone, anywhere in the world, whom they don't know will die.Well, Norma, a teacher, just lost her teacher tuition discount for her son and Arthur's application to be an astronaut was just denied and despite living in a nice looking house in Richmond, Virginia they apparently have no money, so it's not hard to figure out ultimately what they'll do. After all, don't press the button and there's no film -- not that some people who sit through this would've minded that in retrospect.As with his cult hit \"Donnie Darko,\" Kelly keeps \"The Box\" fascinatingly creepy. It starts with the colors, the classic string soundtrack from the band Arcade Fire and some peculiar Easter eggs and moves on to more jarring occurrences. There is never a point where things get so absurd that you don't care what happens in the end, even if there's a chance the end could be terribly unsatisfying. It's one of few saving graces for \"The Box,\" but perhaps even this is only for those intrigued by high concept sci-fi mystery that parallels human nature no matter how vague.When any thriller collapses somewhere after the midway point, you can usually blame the fact that too many occurrences in need of explaining were written in order for the writer to achieve his desired end. When James Marsden gets hit in a car by a truck and comes out of a giant light warehouse and that ultimately never gets explained, its degrading to the viewer.The real trouble with \"The Box\" is how ambitiously it tries to combine the ideas of intelligent life/space exploration with religious notions of life, death and what might come after as well as numerous other elements too many and too difficult to explain. Kelly found that balance between time travel and inter-relationship drama in \"Donnie Darko\" but \"The Box\" implodes on itself by severing its little social experiment from the characters with too much unexplained phenomena.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com","I know that so many reviews on IMDb are extreme, with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or inarticulately tearing it to pieces. I find neither of these kind of reviews helpful, and so I do not give this film the awful review I am about to, lightly. The film is art-house science-fiction of the worst kind dressed up as a Hollywood blockbuster. The trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot, but is actually just a tiny part of a wilfully baffling series of events which are never properly resolved. I like films which challenge the viewer and I do not need to be spoon-fed a plot, and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow. No - the film is just terrible. As the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on Cameron Diaz's wooden acting and a faltering plot-line. Avoid.","I absolutely loved this movie. I can see why many people were turned off, especially if you go into it thinking you know how the movie will go. It was a pleasant surprise, and this movie kept me interested until the end. The plot was something new and fresh, and it unfolded at an excellent pace that mixed in drama and emotions. I actually felt for the characters, and I love the mystery and intrigue with the movie. Me and a friend saw this in theaters and were surprised as to how good it was. I feel this movie is under-appreciated. It has great acting, great sets, excellent cinematography, and what I thought was an interesting plot. If you are a fan of Donnie Darko, The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, etc., you will really like this. Don't listen to the bad reviews and give it a shot with an open mind. If anything, you will at least be kept guessing until the end.","In 1976 a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key. By the late afternoon, a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents Norma with an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash. If they don't press it, nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal. The incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties. Arthur, who is currently working for NASA, fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and Norma, who is a teacher, learns that her faculty funding is being cut.One's enjoyment for this bizarre sci-fi thriller, based on the short story \"Button Button\" by Richard Matheson, will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise. The opening of the film is particularly problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household. Richard Kelly's previous film Donnie Darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes. Without the dream-like state of that far superior film, The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world, is entirely implausible. That Norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as Two-Face from The Dark Knight and believe this offer, seems equally contrived.If this sounds unlikely so far, what follows is even more absurd, involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning, the possibility of alien life or some other Godly being influencing these situations. Scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries, random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the Lewis family, become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity. To a point, the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going. Kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances. In one scene Norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot. He taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes. Later, at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that Norma and Arthur are attending, this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them. Yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci-fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow.What is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on, many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration. The ending, which won't be spoilt here, resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a Greek tragedy. While the resemblances can be seen, by this point, given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances, there is little reason to care. Cameron Diaz's Southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly Langella who is the most disappointing in the film, with a very unsubtly written role, as the mysterious scarred man, who seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud. It really is just a shadow of his towering performance in Frost/Nixon. There is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do; in particular both Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for Kelly's pastiche of ideas. Underdeveloped and brief conversations, such as where Norma sympathises with Arlington over their deformities and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them, highlights this.Since 2001, Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of Donnie Darko. Though this film might be intriguing for a little while, it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film's rather illogical revelations. Science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions, but what Kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic. The Box is one film this year that should have been shelved.","Be warned, the next time you see \"Richard Kelly\" involved in any production, run away. Fast.Kelly proved to the world after his last movie, \"Southland Tales\", that he is one pretentious director. It was indulgent and convoluted. In \"The Box\", not much has changed.I can picture what his pitch to Warner Bros must have been, and I bet the executives at the studio ate it right up: a full-feature film based on one of Richard \"Twilight Zone\" Matheson's old short stories.Big mistake! Do not read any further unless you want this movie COMPLETELY spoiled for you: Norma (Cameron Diaz) pushes the button. Turns out that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an Alien using his body as a vessel to conduct \"experiments\" in which the fate of mankind rests. His face is scarred because he was struck by Alien lightening, which killed him, but then brought him back to life to do all of this red button testing. Obviously since Norma pushes the button, knowing full well that someone may die, she must suffer the consequences for failing to consider someone else's life instead of her own. In the end she and her husband (James Marsden) choose to kill Norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blind.Kelly dances around his film's \"message\", trying to make the audience figure out what the moral of the story is. Obviously, any person with a brain is saying at the beginning, \"What if I was the person who dies?\". Richard Kelly doesn't even let his character's have this normal, HUMAN conversation. In fact, they avoid it all together. They appear to both be educated, working at a prestigious school and also for NASA, so why wouldn't they both have a better ability to LOOK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX???If he had the main characters actually have this conversation, the entire movie could have ended right there! Instead, we have to watch weddings go on forever, NASA and the NSA be complacent to Arlington Stewart taking over these government programs, teleportation to show Marsden life beyond our world so it will be \"easier\" to kill his wife, and drone's controlled by Steward which can be anywhere and nowhere, at any time.The most painful part of this movie is the pacing. Nothing really happens. Its a muddled mish-mash of ideas that are laughable.It is insufferable how this film is being marketed. The commercials make it look like \"Saw\" and even use the music from those films to sell it. In reality what you get is a slow, dull, laughable (yes, half the theater was laughing at the acting and visual effects), and messy film which is neither imaginative, interesting, nor cohesive. At one point, Cameron Diaz and her son are abducted and then suddenly, she is back in the NSA's big black car with her husband on the way home. Where did she go? Why did they take her? Do we really care? Not anymore you won't.By the end you really won't care what happens to any of the characters. You will be rooting for all of them to die so the film will just end. Go see anything else that's playing. Don't waste your time, or money.","Before you dismiss my post as \"not getting it\", let me say...I'm one of the biggest Richard Kelly and \"The Twilight Zone\" fans out there. Donnie Darko is one my all-time favorites and I even thought Southland Tales had it's moments. I'm a HUGE sci-fi fan. I was very excited to see \"The Box\", couldn't wait for it to come out.Having said that...\"The Box\" is terrible. Behind \"Drag Me To Hell\", this was the worst movie I've seen in 2009. And it just simply WILL NOT end! Whenever you think you've reached the end, another change in the plot and you're off to more torture. I was actually groaning in the theater by the end of the film...I could hardly take it anymore.The biggest problem with \"The Box\", no matter how you slice it or try to justify it, is that it simply makes little sense. Trust me, I \"got it\", I understood what was going on. But that doesn't mean it makes a lot of sense looking back on it. Take the basics for example. The main couple...Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, playing Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses her finances at her job, then bemoans that they are \"living paycheck to paycheck\". Well, sell that f-ing Porsche your husband is driving then!!! They live in a beautiful 2-story house in a nice subdivision. Marsden is working what seems to be a high-paid job at NASA and Diaz is an accomplished teacher. And, yes, Marsden drives an overly expensive car. But they are somehow living paycheck to paycheck?!? No need to press the button, just cut down your high-priced lifestyle a bit! The movie would have worked better if they showed the couple jobless and in serious debt. Instead, they are seemingly desperate for money...all the while living what I would call a luxurious lifestyle. Like I said...you can understand what's going on, yet it still makes little sense! That's a rare combination.There was an awful scene in a library that I feel will go down as one of the worst segments in movie history (terribly acted too by the way). It was idiotic, illogical and out of place. I can't even begin to fully describe it actually, so I will move onto a subplot that involves nose-bleeds and body possession by aliens. (Yes, I'm being serious unfortunately). A kid is in Diaz's class with a wicked and smile on his face (a sinister smile that seemingly goes by completely unnoticed by everyone in authority at the school). He starts asking Diaz personal questions, literally embarrassing her in front of her class. No punishment is given to the kid whatsoever...he didn't even get asked to stay after class for a talk! Then Diaz is at a party...and the same kid is one of the hired help...ironed shirt, apron and all! I don't know many alien-possessed kids (who appear to be in Junior High) that also moonlight as a bus-boy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials...but we found one here! (See what I mean...you can understand it completely, but it still makes no sense...a rare combo!) Like many things in the movie, the kid comes and goes...no real explanation about him, no ending to his character. Moving on... A lady then approaches Diaz in a grocery store, telling her that experiments are being ran secretly and her family is one of the test subjects. Well...hmmm...if aliens possess the powers where they can take over a body remotely...and the aliens don't want to help Diaz...then who was taking over this lady's body and giving Diaz advice?! Again...The lady was trying to help Diaz...and the aliens weren't interested in helping Diaz...so who the hell was controlling her body?! Never explained. Never talked about again. No nothing!! It goes on and on and on like this for, what seemed to me like, 2 weeks. It would not end! I wonder if this movie underwent a massive re-shoot at some point. It was poorly edited. Diaz's accent was there one minute, gone the next. Sub-plots began but never ended. The numerous push-backs of the release date obviously shows the problems the producers had with the finished product. It's truly a train-wreck.Pass on this one...there's no redeeming value in it whatsoever. 3 out of 10, just because I like Diaz and sci-fi! But it probably deserves a 1 out of 10.Thanks for reading! JD","The creator of Donnie Darko brings you a twilight zone themed tale of the oddest fashion. The film centers on a middle aged young couple living paycheck to paycheck in 1976. One day a mysterious box appears with a red button. Later on that day a spooky gentleman shows up and tells them that they have the choice to press the button and receive a million dollars but someone they don't know will die. It's a disturbing and provocative question suspensefully outlined in the trailer and TV spots. But let it be known that you just don't know what your in for until you see it. At times pretentious and a bit melodramatic the film is ultimately effective because of it's good performances and intriguing subject matter. It would be unfair to ruin any of the plot twists for you but lets just say the film will deliver on the aspects you expect it to and not completely fulfill others it begins to outline. There's a lot of apparent symbolism and subtext in the film which is both interesting and annoying as it wasn't so evident in his other superior film Donnie Darko. There isn't too much more to say without ruining the film for you. it's meant to inspire lots of cafe chatter afterwards. However, i'd also like to say It's shot well and has an appropriately aged look to it and it's worth a watch. Check it out.","Young buck auteur Richard Kelly has, since \"Donnie Darko,\" pined to be the Hitchcock of metaphysical sci-fi thrillers (a subgenre over which he holds dominion), which has led to a cult following in some circles, and migraine headaches in others. While not a terrible filmmaker by any stretch, Kelly--in a vein similar to Terry Gilliam--rarely knows when to apply the brakes to his craft. \"The Box,\" an ambitious effort backed by a major studio, fascinates and alienates in near-equal proportion. The director's stream-of-consciousness approach to imagery is seldom less than dazzling--there's nary a shot in \"The Box\" that isn't gorgeous, fake CG and all; on a purely superficial level, this is arguably the director's most visually arresting effort to date. As based on the short story 'Button, Button' by Richard Matheson, \"The Box\" is an egregious case of a director mismatched to his material (and Kelly is responsible for the adaptation, as well). While I have not read the story, I have enough familiarity with Matheson's work to know he deals in peeling the layers of sanity and safety away from seemingly banal topics, until fear and uncertainty are the only emotions that remain; matched with Kelly's bombastic narrative complications (NASA, conspiracy theories, trans-dimensional swimming pools...eh), this tale of a husband (James Marsden) and wife (a game--yet wasted--Cameron Diaz) who inherit the titular device that causes a murder only scrapes the surface of being a reflection on morality and sacrifice. A filmmaker like David Lynch (who, despite his excesses, knows a thing or two about subtlety and ambiguity) could have made a sparse, claustrophobic thriller around this theme, but Kelly brings things to a crashing halt in the last 30 minutes, with ridiculous dialog (Marsden's speech about the afterlife; Diaz's confession to Frank Langella's disfigured messenger) that confuses pathos with pretension, developments ripped from a bad '50s B-movie (that bell-ringing Santa), and a desperate attempt (yeah, just like \"Donnie Darko\") to clarify all the enigmas set forth prior. When is this guy going to just trust the material to carry itself without holding the audience's hand through answers he can't even adequately explain? A little ambiguity goes a long way, and could have transformed \"The Box\" into a great thriller instead of a frustratingly wasteful night at the movies.","The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it. Press the button, they will get a million dollars in cash and a person they don't know will die. I'll try not to spoil anything, but from there things devolve into a plot so intertwined and complex and purely original that it will make you question your sanity. But hey, most of us have been sane for a while now, and change is good.PROS: Amazing storyline, overall good acting, not a slow moment once it gets going. It asks questions of human morality that are rarely, if ever asked in popular culture. This movie is deep, it has meaning. Its not summer blockbuster special effects fluff (not that there's anything wrong with that); this movie had a relatively low budget and it showed in some places. But i think it is perhaps that very thing that makes me like it so much.CONS: The first twenty minutes, before it gets going, are really quite slow. At the end of the movie, you will be so confused that you just have to sit down and think for a good half hour. I can guarantee that this movie will not get rave reviews from your peers or most critics; it is far too strange and there aren't explosions every three seconds. In fact there are no explosions of any kind in this movie (besides your brain popping from trying to understand exactly what the heck just happened). Personally I don't think this is a bad thing, but many will.RATING: Easily a 9/10. I have never had an experience like watching this movie. The only reason I can't give it a 10/10 is that it is just too wrapped up in itself. There are several large things left unexplained at the end that are still bugging me as I sit here writing this. But overall, this is the best experience I have had in a movie theater in quite a long time. But be warned, you will not like this movie if you can't sit back, turn on your suspension of disbelief to about 150%, and prepare your brain to do some impressive acrobatics.Visit www.thestuffblag.com for more reviews","Ha ha. - oh no - what to say about this film? Yes - green eggs and ham makes more sense than this movie. Where does one start? A lot of the good stuff has already been said - so I won't divulge into the same territory. I believe you already have the movie summary - so I won't paraphrase the movie.First - let's start the with good.1). If you like psychological thrillers that make you think (as I do) the first 29 minutes of this film will be for you - this is one of those films that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long car drives when you were kids like (what if you had to chose one family member live, another to die, or, what if you had to die by drowning or fire) This movie is a great concept - bottom line.2) The wardrobe group did a fine job with bringing us back to the 70's. Realistically though, how difficult is that to accomplish? .....Okay, that's about all for the good. Let's talk about the bad.1). This movie feels like a 2 hour \"Twilight Zone\" episode. This could easily be 90 minutes. That might have made the movie tolerable.2). Do you remember in the movie \"From Dusk til Dawn?\". The movie started out interesting, then halfway through the movie it just took a degrading turn? Yep - same thing here. I would venture to say that the writers started with a concept, then had no idea what to do with it. I've gotten deeper thought provocation out of Transformers 2.3). Yes - we get the dilemma in the film. We understand the philosophical undertones and Utilitarian approach - but the story jumped around way too much, didn't elaborate on the current story arc, and took a(forgive me)completely insulting direction.4). The ending didn't make sense. Not at all. None.This movie would make a great term paper in college philosophy 101. If you're board out of your mind, in bed sick, or have ever enjoyed being hit in the face with a pie, and can view this free on-line - by all means, go for it.If you need to pay anything to view this movie, don't waste your time - you're better off watching old Howie Mandel stand-up on You Tube. You will get more philosophical stimulation reorganizing your sock drawer.","First time I ever felt I needed to write a review.I have seen thousands of movies in my life and I like a wide range of movies. I am reasonably opened minded, and can easily say I enjoyed a movie while still saying \"yeah it was not good but I enjoyed it\". I can appreciate the mastery of great movies like The Shaw shank redemption, the godfather, and American history X. I can like good movies in a genre like horror, or comedy, even if the movie might not be that great. I can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to entertain me (Bloodsport). I also will try to rate movie fairly even if I did not like it. City lights by Charlie Chapin was not a movie I enjoyed, but I can appreciate the acting and story lines for the time.I think some people when they go on this site instead of randomly click a rating, should take a few ideas into account. Try to rate the movie based on how good it actually was. Do not let your personal bias affect the rating. Also look at other moves you rated and compare the movie you are going to rate.This \"movie\" was the worst piece of trash I have ever seen. 2 hours of my life where just stolen. The acting was awful, across the board. The scenes where choppy at best. However the real disgrace was the story. The first 20 minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point A to B. However after that it was a nightmare. They kept trying to add new elements but nothing was every explained. Nothing really ever made sense, was steward dead, is he alive, did he hit by lighting, was it really lighting, was it aliens, is he an alien, etc. The ending tied nothing together and really did not answer any questions. The only positive was nobody cared we where just happy to leave the theater.6.5/10??? What is wrong with some of you? I will admit that the 8 of us where so mad about seeing this, we did think \"what would make it better?\", and we decide to tell a few of our friends that this movie was good so they would have to suffer and see this movie. What can I say misery loves company. That is really the only reason I can see for a 6.5 rating.Do not waste your life!","Nose bleeds will never be the same again. Seriously.Spoilers ahead. Being a \"Twilight Zone\" fan, I expected an interesting take on the original story (which I found intriguing). Under the \"right\" circumstances, every person has a price, meaning everybody would \"push the button\", whether it's for money, love, knowledge, youth or something else. That makes it a good premise, but the movie wants to be \"deeper\", cooler and more complex. It's complex, alright. What they do here is take dull biblical concepts like hell, afterlife and \"eternal damnation\" and mix it with Jean Paul Sartre's existentialism (spelled out like for 10-year-olds), aliens from outer space, dead people resurrected, Arthur Clarke references, a love story, zombies, dumb sci-fi and some simplistic lectures on ethics. Dialogues are bad and the CGI is so obvious, it makes Langella's face ridiculous. This is \"Mars Attacks meets The Day the Earth Stood Still meets Saw meets Knowing and God knows what else\". Plot elements are thrown in randomly and nothing makes sense. Why is it set in 1976? Why are those particular families targeted? How does the box work? Why does the babysitter have pictures of the victims in her room? Why do aliens give a sh*t about humans in the first place? If these aliens are so \"ethical\" (funny idea), then why do they use such sadistic methods? If the purpose of the \"test\" is only to evaluate people's altruism quotient, than why torture them afterwards with complicated mind games? Why not just wipe them out? Why do aliens use a dead man with a facial disfigurement to perform their \"tests\"? What about the \"lighting\"? Who exactly are the \"employers\"? Why those particular \"employees\" and what happened to them? Why do aliens want to \"save\" human kind and yet make people kill each other? Why do they harm innocent children? What was the government's involvement? Was that kid with the \"evil grin\" and the peace sign supposed to be scary? Or that old lady in the library with a nose bleed? What's up with all that water? How come this supposedly \"struggling\" family owns such an expensive car? And more important... What was the scriptwriter smoking when he wrote those lines? More questions arise, and more offensive religious crap paves the way. Why are Women portrayed as the ones responsible for all the corruption in the world? I'm surprised they didn't insert the Devil cliché...oh, wait... Was Langella's character the devil? Is the Devil a Martian? Do Martians appreciate Jean Paul Sartre? Is it possible that Sartre was one of them ? Such complexity is overwhelming.","If The Box was a Wishing Well, and you've just thrown in $2 for a wish, you would wish for your $2 back. Whoever directed, wrote, starred in, participated or financed this movie have quite literally just ended their careers. I wanted to give this movie an IMDb rating of less than 1, but the site wouldn't let me.Once this movie is released in the States, expect the average IMDb rating to drop from its current respectable 7/10 to less than 4. It is THAT bad. Most of the reviews were probably written by people involved in the making of the movie. God, I cannot fathom how much this film sucks. I thought the trailer for the film awesome, a box which gave someone $1 million if they pressed a button under the knowledge that someone random; they do not know; will die. Cool idea right? Wrong.Without giving too much away, imagine a movie which is about love, sacrifice, horror, religion, god, family, the apocalypse, morals, aliens, crime, science, Jesus, superpowers, feminism and lightning. The Box is that movie.","I watch this movie, seemingly not expecting much, but this comes like a deep surprise to me. I would not get to the first part of the story about man bringing the box 'bla, bla, bla stuff'. This is not what this movie is about. The truth about this movie is that its not dealing so much with moral dilemma(in fact no one of the protagonists asks if they have right to kill a person or not) than its with consequences. In fact consequences are the big part of this movie, when the protagonists are wrapped inside of this choices and its not important what choice they made, because each choice is 'as bad as others' only because they made a choice pushing a button. Its the point that this movie tries to make, than one choice leades to another. Not only that, but the choices they made, leads to choices OTHER PEOPLE make. I think this movie can be read like a biblical work, though its highly philosophical and not for shallow persons and you would at least need to dwelve deep into yourself to understand the importancy of what its trying to show. Lets hope you would at least be in your sit when the movie finishes its touch on you.","I wish I could be surprised at the rating of this film being so low but it sums up the state of humanity just as this film does. TOO MANY MORONS OBVIOUSLY DO NOT THINK WHEN WATCHING A FILM!This was one of the best films I have seen in a long time. The parallels it draws with human nature, capitalism, war, the way we treat one another and also the impeding Alien interference is unbelievably incredible and anyone who thinks this film is actually anything less than a 7 is deluded and would probably push the button. As you probably know, the plot revolves around a box with a button that kills someone if pressed, and in return, whoever presses it gets a million dollars. The box is passed on daily to new strangers and the pattern continues. While that could have gone any direction, it was used as a metaphor for our greed and tendency to put ourselves first over someone else's misery or in this case total demise. Humanity is in a current state of exactly this. We destroy the planet in the name of money and instant profit, we go to war killing people we don't know in the name of freedom, which anyone with their head screwed on knows is a complete lie and is actually just a facade for a bunch of people's greed. If we continue doing this to ourselves and the planet, we will have nothing left. In my opinion, that is EXACTLY the message this film was portraying and it did it spectacularly. Maybe I only saw the message because I wouldn't have pushed the button and am a firm believer in being the change you wish for. This film stood to point out the flaws in humanity. Many of my friends said they would have pushed the button. I'm quite disappointed in them, but I can see why. Nobody thinks there will be a consequence, even though you're killing someone. It's quite heartbreaking but until you tell them in plain black and white what the consequence will be, they are blinded by their greed.If (and I think there is quite a lot of evidence for it) Aliens are watching us, they would no doubt be wondering what the heck we are doing as a race and how we could be so unevolved. We stand no chance of survival as a race unless we stop thinking about our own fortunes and start pulling together collectively. That means not killing people, not going to war, not destroying the planet/ raping its resources for capital and actually uniting as people regardless if we know each other or not.This film contained this message and I am disappointed it obviously hasn't touched a majority of people here.One of my friends who said he would push the button was in the process of signing up to the Armed forces. He has since changed his mind, siting a combination of this film and my added analysis as the reason. I wish it will continue to spread such a positive message and making a difference in this messy world we live in.If you didn't enjoy this film, then fair enough, that's your issue, but I hope the message was at least clear to you.. How people have rated this so low is shocking!In my opinion this film is pure genius.","THE BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Rebhorn, Holmes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. Truly disappointing adaptation of genre legend Richard Matheson's sci-fi chiller \"Button, Button\" by on the wane wunderkind filmmaker Richard Kelly who truly stretches a small, well-crafted piece into a grab-bag 'WTF'-a-thon! Mysterious (and ridiculously maimed!) man, Langella, posits a million dollar offer to 'struggling' couple Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly vanilla bland to the hilt!): a box with a red-button, that when pushed, will kill some stranger in the world (!) Sure strings are attached but does that really matter here? What does is why in the name of God does Kelly trowel on so much oddness (i.e. nose-bleeds; watery transport systems – that's right – Watery.Transport.Systems) when the tension should be strung as tautly as possible (oh the possibilities). If this sounds like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode you are half right (the '80s TV re-boot actually did a decent small-screen adaptation; in fact rent that instead!) One of the year's worst films.","This film just opened a film festival in Lund, Sweden, weeks before the official release. Although the film didn't make a massive impression on me, I definitely found it worthwhile.It is a film that makes you think. The pace is slow, scary at times and gradually building a mood of mystery. Although confusing in the beginning, there is an explanation to it, like it or like it not. Satisfying to some, adding to the feeling of mystery to others.It would be interesting to see the original short film the plot is based upon, in particular to see how the message could be delivered in a more condensed manner. James and Frank were convincing, although Cameron doesn't quite deliver, perhaps not her genre.","This movie is really pretty empty. A mildly intriguing premise is never fully developed. It feels like someone got excited about a one-line idea and went straight into production before the script had a chance to take shape. Payoffs are few and far between. The script is as clunky as a supermarket trolley. The sub plots are deadends. And the cast... well, poor ol' Cameron tried hard but she didn't have much material to work with. And the extras? Wow - they really were something out of the box. They wouldn't have looked out of place in a late 1960's B-grade telemovie about the Village of the Feeble Minded (And Badly Acted) but in a full ticket price movie? Nahhh. They really dragged what little plausibility this movie had way down below the critical threshold of believability, and in some instances almost imposed an unwanted comedic tone into what should have been some serious moments (you'll see what I mean if you decide to see this film!). The Box is not worth seeing unless you are faced with a binary forced choice between this film and an anaesthetic-free dental appointment. It's weak. It's laboured. It's boring. And kinda' silly. Catch it on DVD when you can get it in a bundle of Weeklies for five bucks and then at least you can Eject it as soon as you realise it isn't going anywhere.
