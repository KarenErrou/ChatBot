{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120350/reviews"],"review-text":["The movie was certainly true to the real life story on which it was based. It was hard for me to find newspaper articles about the actual facts, but when I located them, I could see that truth, in this case, was stranger than fiction. Judith Light was frighteningly evil in her role as the mother in this movie, so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role, the mark I think of an excellent performance. Rick Schroder was appropriately clueless as her son who also defended her in court, an example of how hard it can be in some circumstances for a child to accept the actions of a parent, no matter how criminal they may be. One can find fault with the movie, but not with its treatment of the reality on which it was based.","When I first saw this movie back in the middle of January (2005) I didn't like it. I thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star, Judith Light, acted were so unlike her. (Which of course is true) And then I watched bits of it the next day when it re-aired and I felt pretty much the same. Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing. I even cried the first 2 times, but mainly because the actress was actually crying and I am a big fan of hers.It is a very well acted and done TV Movie. Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film! I keep watching it over and over. It's a sad movie, but very good.If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it! It's not usually my type of movie, but I did enjoy this one! A+++","An incredible performance! This is one of the best films i have seen ever. I know this is being said a lot, but i bet you will not regret watching this film.It's great from the very beginning to the last second. The acting (of especially the mother - played by Judith Light) is so convincing, there are not many other films i've seen that could compare to it, and it seems it's impossible not to feel anything for the people in this drama.There are lots and lots of movies made every year, but if you have to choose just to see a few in your life - make this one of them.","I'm not in favor of death penalties but in this movie, it couldn't happen fast enough. Just to end the movie. I don't understand why this movie is rated as high as it is. It fooled me into a bad night.","While I don't normally like these types of formulaic films on LMN, this one works thanks to Judith Light. She is extremely believable as over-protective and rather sociopath mother, Diana Donahue, the last woman, according to \"Crimelibrary\", to be executed by the electric chair in California.She basically sends her son through law school, and at first seems to have only his best intentions as her concern. When he later begins dating a nurse (Sarah Trigger) the pathology starts as Mrs. Donahure realizes she is now losing her son for good to a new wife.If you enjoy this type of story you may also like \"Mother Love\" shown on PBS with Diana Rigg. A film made in the early 90's concerning a similar storyline, both very well done with good performances.","If there are people that don't like this movie, I don't think they are human. This film deploys all emotions and shows many sides of Judith Light's character. Made in 1997, this is one of the best movies I have seen and really the film that Judith Light has starred in to make me a huge fan of hers. This movie, although sometimes you want to rattle the son for trusting her so much, is incredibly moving. I cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me! The plot doesn't have much to it but the acting provided by Judith Light is incredible. She looks beautiful the whole time and by the end, you don't want the fate imposed by the courts to happen to her. Overall, a movie worth my highest praise! Thank you for making it and redefining my view on the death penalty. I eagerly await this movie to come out on DVD or some other form of media since Lifetime is starting to issue some movies to customers. Although I don't have high hopes for this one because this took place almost 9 years ago, which is still hard to believe, since this movie is STILL ingrained into my head after all this time.","Wow - this was one EVIL mother. I'm sure we all know someone with an overbearing mum, but this was just ridiculous. The only thing more infuriating than her sociopathic meddling was the ignorance of her son (played by Ricky \"Rick\" Schroeder). You would think that if he was smart enough to be a brilliant attorney (?), he would be able to put two and two together when very bad things started to happen.Attorney Rick has lived his entire life up to this point somehow accepting his mother's involvement in every aspect of his life. It's almost uncomfortable to the viewer; she behaves like an incestuous mother and they bicker and make-up like a creepy couple. Things get really out of hand when he flies the coop and attempts to become a normal independent 30-year-old man...Overall, a classic example of a great Lifetime movie: has-beens, decent acting, good plot, a 'strong' or psychotic woman, and at least one character that infuriates the hell out of you. 6 out of 10.","I HAVE IT ON AGAIN TODAY. incredible TOP-Notch driven action drama,in the Nefarious sense! Judith Light from One Life to Live,is awesome. Great actress,rick Schroeder really look like her some and i do feel bad for Abby and the sweet unborn child Murdered by grandma and her his new wife. sad beyond belief,i know she was the last woman to die in the \"gas chamber\"the woman in real life Diane Donahue i feel bad seeing it but at same time i was saying well she did commit the ultimate sin, next to to a kidnapping of a innocent child within the family, or the every day type kidnapping,etc. or rape of a child etc.... Hence i do feel Death Penalty was appropriate but feel bad for her she was not able to be a Normal grandmother,and mother to a great girl like Abby or to who especially was really loving her son and IN love,truly with her so,a real tragedy here.but a great awesome acting on both parts.....adi√≥s.

In \"The Shining,\" Jack Nicholson was more likable, after he went bonkers, than Light is here.If you want to have an interesting mind trip -- with Schroder nearly 30 in this film -- ponder what would be in a prequel, detailing for a couple of hours Ricky's character in his childhood and teen years with this mom!"],"review-user":["Sonetto","ClassicActress","McF","dylanb","MarieGabrielle","Adidas4ever8416","cptnhook13","domincanredangel","caa821"],"review-date":["20 March 2005","25 March 2005","6 October 2000","2 March 2002","31 January 2011","23 August 2005","25 February 2006","30 January 2011","2 September 2006"],"review-rating":["8","10","10","3","8","10","6","10","6"],"review-title":[" Movie was true to the story it was based on\n"," Based On A True Story - A Mother who is obsessed with her son, plots and has her pregnant daughter-in-law murdered.\n"," Make sure you don't miss this one!\n"," Too Bad to Watch\n"," The true crime story of Diana Donahue...\n"," Judith Light at her VERY best...\n"," Judith Light is Ugly...and so is her personality\n"," Judith light is lovely GREAT actress proved in soaps,who's the boss,and movies,she is so great!what a sad movie though.\n"," Agree with \"captnhook\"\n"]}
