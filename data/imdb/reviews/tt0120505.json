{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120505/reviews"],"review-text":["Director Fabio Barreto got a strange Academy Nominea for his last movie O Quatrilho. Quatrilho is a bad movie, but in Bella Donna, Barreto did one of the Worst movies of All Time. His adaptation of the novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous. Think with me how poor brazilians fishermen speak a perfect english? In the film they do. There isn't a Screenplay, It's only a very long videoclip with a beautiful places and many sex scenes with Moscovis and Henstridge.","I have seen one vidcap of this movie, and I am stunned.  Natasha has done some nude/love scenes before, but this one was especially hot!  As for the movie itself, I saw a couple parts (not the sexy ones :() of it.  Where can I see all of this movie, rent it, or buy it?  Please help.","The movie is a happy lullaby, was made to make us sleep. And that´s what we do, as we dream about the top beautiful Natasha Henstridge. No screenplay, no deep characters, nothing special. So, let´s sleep.","Does anyone know where it is available?  If so send message through this excellent database.  Some of her earlier films continue to be unreleased, but I keep looking.  Besides her beauty, her biggest appeal is her straight forwardness and open attitude."],"review-user":["vasco","fmoji001","ROSP!","jbald"],"review-date":["13 September 1998","7 March 2000","23 September 1998","11 August 2001"],"review-rating":["1","3"],"review-title":[" One of the Worst Movies of All Time\n"," Wow\n"," Vamos Dormir...
