{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095593/reviews"],"review-text":["Time does extraordinary things. It's the ultimate judge. Time has granted \"Married To The Mob\" an extra doses of freshness. There aren't any dead moments or cheap shots. It's more of a delight now than it ever was. Michelle Pfeiffer creates a mafia widow that it's as far away from a caricature as anything she's ever done. A true original creation touching or hinting at the stereotype just to guide us through but her Angela is quite unique. The legendary Dean Stockwell presents us with a a mafia boss that it's just as menacingly real as he is hilarious. And Matthew Modine? Why did I think back then that he didn't have any chemistry with Pfeiffer? I was wrong. They are wonderful together. They reminded me, this time, to the Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray of \"Remember The Night\" I'm writing this comment now to entice you to visit or revisit this Jonathan Demme gem.","This is a consistently funny story with some serious action scenes thrown in here and there. That combination of mob movie and comedy makes this a fun film to watch.l The characters in this movie are just that: characters. Everyone is a little off, actually a little too wacky for any believability. It's just a outrageous story played for laughs with few things making sense or being realistic.Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine are the stars but Mercedes Ruehl steals the show, in my opinion, as the jealous wife. Dean Stockwell is great as the smooth mob man. Even with all the makeup to make her look cheap, Pfeiffer (\"Angela de Marco\") still can't hide that fabulous face. The costumes in here are great, too.This is not family fare with a deserved R-rating for language, violence and some nudity but it's not really a rough movie. It has its charms, that's for sure. Modine plays the nice guy \"Mike Downey.\"Note: stay with the ending credits, because there is a lot of footage of scenes that never made it to the movie but were very interesting.","I had to write this review because the only user comments on file don't begin to do this film justice.   For one thing, Michelle Pfeiffer is TERRIFIC in this role -- she demonstrates a marvelous comedic style we don't often get to see.  (Maybe the other reviewer prefers her serious work, but I dispute the comment that Pfeiffer has \"matured\" beyond this role.  It's a comedy, for goodness' sake!)And yes, Alec Baldwin is quite good, but it's Matthew Modine who steals the picture!  (He also has much more screen time.)  Mercedes Ruehl and Dean Stockwell (as Tony 'The Tiger' Russo) are absolutely delicious.  The plot is delightful, and sometimes manages to touch on some more somber issues, as all great comedies do.In short, I've seen this hilarious film two or three times over the years, and thinking about it now makes me eager to watch it all over again!","This is a fun movie with subtle intention. Its off-beat comedy is hilarious to me, unfunny to my friends. The soundtrack is perfect.I own this on VHS and I have watched it many, many times, because it's simply a fun and funny love story with great performances by all the principals (though using Joan Cusack solely as a perch for big hair was a waste of her talent. I know, I know, she was still young...).On a sad note, I decided to check out the DVD last night (instead of watching my VHS tape), and was SHOCKED to find many crucial scenes cut. And on the copy I watched, there was no special feature of deleted scenes: it was as if the deleted scenes never existed!! I am so glad I bought the used VHS at a flea market.It is clear there was a great deal of choreography in this, which is another reason I love it so much. It takes great skill, talent, and genius to move around the scenes like Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell, and Matthew Modine do from scene to scene (Note the scene when the grocery carts converge, the rolling on the floor during the shoot-out in Miami, the Chicken Lickin' debacle, the foot massage, the salon hair-washing.) There is a very \"theatrical\" feel to this film, which may be the turn-off for so many whose poor reviews follow: I know some viewers who don't quite understand this style mistake the exaggerations and over-the-top performances for poor acting and worse direction. Not so. Jonathan Demme does a great job bringing to life the entire company and their respective roles.The opening credits and first scene rank among my all-time favorites, as well (another favorite opening credits/first scene: Fly Away Home).Too bad Matthew Modine so ardently skipped out of the public eye; I really like him, and found his casting PERFECT in the role of Mike Smith. Actually, this film is well-cast from soup to nuts: everyone is believable and true to his role. As for the question of expecting audience to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians - why not? I thought they pulled it off perfectly well.Charming, fun, exciting... what is there not to like? If you want a little fun, watch this quirky, colorful adventure-mob-love story. If you are looking to learn more about organized crime and families, tune to HBO's The Sopranos.","Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine are a joy to watch in this screwball comedy. Alec Baldwin, who was an up and coming star when the film was made, is a hoot. Dean Stockwell, in a sendup of John Gotti, is hysterical. But Mercedes Ruehl, as the paranoid and over the top Connie steals the movie.Jonathan Demme, previously known for wacky comedies like \"Something Wild\" and \"Melvin and Howard\"-proves once again that he is a genius. I was not surprised at all when he went on to win the Oscar for directing \"Silence of The Lambs.\" The performances he evokes from his actors in \"Married\" are inspired, and the audience is taken along for a wild and wooly ride.One of the cutest, most endearing films of the 80's, it stands head and shoulders above many of the satires of its era.","Michelle Pfeiffer is ideally cast as the frustrated mob widow in this colourful black comedy. Matthew Modine plays a clumsy FBI agent who has taken a fancy to her. Dean Stockwell steals the show as the big shot who keeps on pestering Pfeiffer; Mercedes Ruehl is dynamic as his jealous wife. It's all very eighties, but that just adds to the fun. A nice little flick, though not for every taste.","This is a romantic comedy, so it's really a fairy tale, but an unconventional one. Cinderella, rather than living in the ashes, lives in an overdecorated castle in the suburbs with a good looking husband who's no prince. She does find her prince, but he's not that handsome. Instead of a castle, at least initially, she gets a tiny walk-up in Manhattan.Pfeifer, Stockwell and Ruehl lead a cast of fully realized, if a little over-the-top, characters. Demme reaches the highest level of movie-making in my mind. He creates a world I want to move into - a Manhattan neighborhood and street life teeming with life and community.I wish IMDb linked to reviewers' other comments. I'd like to know what other movies the people who panned this one hate. I am always looking for a lot of laughs and for nice places in which to \"live\" at least for an hour or so.","The mobster 'Cucumber' Frank de Marco (Alec Baldwin) is married with the housewife Angela de Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer) and she in unhappy with their marriage and wants the divorce. Frank is having a love affair with Karen Lutnick (Nancy Travis), who is the mistress of his boss Tony 'The Tiger' Russo (Dean Stockwell). When Tony discovers their love affair, he kills them in a party. Tony is under surveillance of the FBI agents Mike Downey (Matthew Modine) and Ed Benitez (Oliver Platt) and during the wake, Tony kisses Angela. The agents and Tony's wife Connie Russo (Mercedes Ruehl) believe that the widow Angela is having an affair with Tony. Angela takes the opportunity to move from the suburbs to a small apartment in New York with her son. Meanwhile Mike bugs her apartment and soon they fall in love with each other. But Tony discovers her new address and courts her. Soon the FBI Senior Management blackmails Angela to force her to get close to Tony to help the FBI to arrest him and she discovers that Mike is an agent. Will Angela give a second chance to Mike?\"Married to the Mob\" is another great film from the 80's, directed by Jonathan Demme and with a story with comedy, romance and action. The chemistry between Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine is impressive but Mercedes Ruehl steals the show. There is cameo participation of famous people and this movie is still attractive and has not aged after being watched many times along almost thirty years. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"De Caso com a MÃ¡fia\" (\"In an Affair with the Mafia\")","I just wanted to write a quick response to all those people who give this film a bad review because they think it isn't funny or that it's boring. \nHere's the trick --- the film is not meant to be just a comedy.  It's got some depth to it.  Like many Demme films it deals with people living in some of the odd corners of our society who are trying to work out how to put together a fulfilling life for themselves. Unfortunately, the movie and home video industries don't deal well with subtlety and drop this in the \"COMEDY\" bin.  It IS funny, but a lot of the humor is off-beat.  However, the heart of the movie is not about the humor but about the people in it.It may not be one of the greatest films in the world but it is solid and entertaining. And the cast is one of those that shows why casting is an art unto itself. Michelle Pfieffer is great and this may be the film that showed she had some acting chops to add to her beauty.  Mercedes Ruehl is a big hoot and gets to chew the scenery in the way only she can, in a role which requires it. Throw in Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack in smaller roles and the talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaak and you've got a great cast throughout which here, as usual, makes a great difference.Matthew Modine is fun, but more important, he's a major hottie in this movie.  Hot, cute and sexy.Sit back, expect the unexpected and let the movie take you where it wants to go and you should have a great time.","It ain't Shakespeare, that's true, but it is a light and breezy romp. Pfieffer and Modine and Baldwin and Dean Stockwell are all having a great time with this 'dissatisfied mob wife' tale, and you will too. Interesting to watch this in the light of the \"sopranos\"- they are like loopy relatives somehow. Demme went on to greater, darker films (silence of the lambs, philadelphia) but I still enjoy his lighter period. So will you.","First, don't be fooled by my family name. My mother was full blooded Italian, so I really know Italian families, and I LOVE mobster movies, even the funny ones like this.For those people who have bad rapped this film (you know who you are) you should have your movie privileges taken from you because you don't know what good is. This is a damn funny and well-styled film. The fact that almost nobody is Italian in it is part of the joke, so far as I can see. And what red-blooded straight male could complain about spending an hour and something with the likes of Michelle Pfieffer? Puh-lease! When I saw this film it won me over with the opening song by Rosemary Clooney who was as Irish as one can get, but her pronunciation of the Italian words in \"Mambo Italiano\" is flawless and sets the tone of what is to follow perfectly. (Hell, I even bought the record the next day because of it.) Just the look of every garish thing in the apartment that I have personally seen in my relatives houses, though not in the same place (which I found hysterical) sold it for me.This movie is like Goodfellas on laughing gas. I just wonder why there are no Burger Worlds and what happened to the food these guys were supposed to get? My guess is the crew ate it. \"The Fries are crispy. The shakes are creamy.\" My mouth is watering almost as much as it is thinking of the gorgeous Ms. Pfieffer. (And I never trusted clowns anyway.) And the three best things about this film are Mercedes Ruehl's achingly funny mob wife spurned, Dean Stockwell as her philandering husband Tony \"The Tiger\" and last, but DEFINITELY not least, the great mugging by Oliver Platt who should get more comic roles. And note to myself: find out where that black chick went. Ouch! Why does she work so infrequently? This picture is right alongside the great mob movies as it should be.","This has to be one of Michelle Pfeiffer's best performances, she totally nailed the part! Dean Stockwell couldn't be more perfect for the role. There was a moment when the FBI arrived at the Honeymoon suite, and he turned and snapped his fingers, his response was so immediate, so realized that it became supreme entertainment. One of the other great moments are when the FBI brothers go \"B-i-n-g-o\" wth each other, and it's because Jonathan Demme adds these touches is what makes him so great. Mercedes Ruel is dynamite too. Pfeiffer's boyfriend acted a little too awkward but was still very right for the part. The more stale and formulated plot is what abled this movie's story to be so clear and over the top. When deleted scenes were cut into credit sequences in the end it felt beautiful and brilliantly cheerful. Great movie, great performances, great director.","Came across this the other day on TV and what drew my attention right away was a young Alec Baldwin and Michelle Pfeiffer and her dreamy eyes and 80s fashion and then you start hearing some 80s music from New Order and it's like okay I'm hooked.But the movie got worse as it went along it seemed.It had some awesome potential but it seemed like the directors intention was to make this movie silly.Don't get me wrong I have nothing against silly but I really think this movie could have been a great smart comedy.This movie is saved somewhat by Michelle, you're drawn by how beautiful she looked in this film while trying to convey trashy gangster wife, and the acting overall in this movie is pretty good, you see lots of generic mobster acting mannerisms that were the style of the time which you sometimes still see till recently in the Sopranos for example. If you're going to into this movie looking for some silly fun and a 80s period piece than you will like it.","this is no great shakes as a comedy or as anything else, there are maybe two or three lines in this whole film that will even make you laugh, and even those are pretty dumb. the whole thing is quite inoffensive, though, and agreeably dopey (in a rather knowing way). Married to the Mob is probably Demme's most sheerly beautiful film, physically - it has an exquisite look to it, capturing the mob milieu with an exquisite tackiness rivalled only by Scorsese's Casino. And Demme really knows how to put together a cast - there's not a deadbeat or a lame, Susan Clark-type actor in the bunch, and while they really have very little to work with here, they make the whole dumb enterprise just that much more likable. And Dean Stockwell is great.","Whatever happened to Matthew Modine and Mercedes Ruehl? They were excellent here.This is a very funny film regarding the underworld. Michelle Pfeiffer is the girl who married a mafia man, played briefly by Alec Baldwin. Baldwin takes a bullet from crime boss, Tony Russo, played with extreme relish by Dean Stockwell. Stockwell merited a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his wonderful portrayal. Russo kills Frankie (Baldwin) and then comes on to his widow. (Michelle Pfeiffer) She is ethical in that she wanted to lead a better life than living among the mobsters with their vicious wives. As Stockwell's insanely jealous wife, Mercedes Ruehl carries the day here.Matt Modine is the FBI agent who falls for Angie (Pfeiffer) and she soon is coerced by the FBI to work for them in nabbing Russo.This is basically another funny gangster film and it succeeds.","Married To The Mob was one of the first VHS tapes that I had along with Coming To America and Grease. I still have fond memories of this film after all these years. Hell, I still have the VHS of this film in good condition.The story: Undercover cop Mike Downey(Matthew Modine)is sent to spy on Angela De Marco(Michelle Pfeiffer) the wife of the slain mafia member Frank \"Cucumber\" De Marco(Alec Baldwin). He later falls in love with her after he realizes that she is innocent in all this. Angela not only has to deal with the unwanted advances of mob boss Tony \"The Tiger\" Russo(Dean Stockwell), she also has to deal with his jealous wife Connie Russo(Mercedes Ruehl).Married To The Mob is funny and still keeps your interest when its not trying to be funny. I like the little jabs it takes at mafia life(the jealous mafia wife, the mob boss that doesn't realize that he is not a chick magnet etc) and you like the characters of Angela De Marco and Mike Downey. It was the last of the funny phase of Johnathan Demme before he got serious and gave you gems like Philadelphia and Silence Of The Lambs(best thriller of all time). If you're in the mood for comedy, Married To The Mob is a keeper. Its better than the rubbish that passes for comedy nowadays(Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet The Spartans, Disaster Movie etc).","I'm surprised with the amount of negative reviews on this film. If you don't like this movie for what it is - a silly, over-the-top, mob story - then you are simply reading too much into it. This film is a classic tale of a mob wife trying to escape \"the life\" and the troubles that follow her. Michelle Pfeiffer is terrificly 80's 'jersey, who is an uncertain, uncomfortable mob wife while Matthew Modine is an anal retentive-like mob tracking cop who falls for her. The plot is mostly predictable and cutesy and Mercedes Ruel steals the show as the Queen of Mob Wives. If you aren't looking for something too dynamic and complex, this movie is absolutely entertaining and an 80's cult classic. You won't be able to stop watching if you start.","Strange but acceptable mob comedy that has an undercover FBI agent (Matthew Modine) flirting with a mobster's concerned widow (Michelle Pfeffier) to tie two murders on a elusive mob boss (Dean Stockwell).The movie shows that it doesn't have to go over the top just to be funny and director Jonathan Demme (\"The Silence of the Lambs\", \"Philadelphia\") keeps the movie from looking like it being was restrained.  That's good and it avoids being predictiable, too.","What happened to Ava Gardner in the 1940s and Marilyn Monroe in the '50s also seemed to take place for modern-day actress Michelle Pfeiffer in the '80s: Her remarkable good looks got in the way of her being taken seriously as an accomplished, superbly talented actress. Anyone looking for validation of Pfeiffer's dramatic abilities need look no further than her work in 1991's \"Frankie and Johnny\" or '92's \"Love Field\" (a personal favorite of mine); those looking to see what a splendid comedic actress she can be, when given the right part, should check out 1988's \"Married to the Mob.\" In this one, she plays Angela Demarco, the widow of a recently \"iced\" Mob hit-man, who moves from her garishly tacky Long Island home to start a new life for herself and her son, while being pursued by Mob boss Dean Stockwell and FBI man Matthew Modine. While this movie has lots going for it (a very amusing script; offbeat characters; sudden sharp turns to unexpected violence, as in director Jonathan Demme's previous effort \"Something Wild\"; and hilarious yet menacing performances by Stockwell and Mercedes Ruehl, as his jealous wife from hell), Michelle steals the show easily. Notice how perfectly she nails Angela's undereducated, Long Island Italian accent, and the many fine mannerisms that she brings to the role to really flesh out this spunky and surprisingly bright character. Once upon a time, long ago, Oscars were handed out to actresses for comedic roles such as this one. Had this film been made 60 years ago, Michelle mighta been a contenduh...","Have you ever tried a kind of food that your friend made, and then said to yourself, \"wow, that was not a good mix\"? Well, that is how I felt after watching this film.Many viewers will be left highly uncomfortable with this weird mix of crime and very, very corny comedy. Its almost like watching Mr. Rogers play a ruthless gangster, very weird. Some things just don't mix and this film clearly proves that.There are some very good performances here, as Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle, and Alec Baldwin are all excellent, but that doesn't make up for the lack of balance and symmetry in the film.Jonathan Demme has done some excellent work in films such as Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia, but seems to be out of his element with this one.","The only redeeming part of this film was seeing nancy travis naked...she should have done this more often because she looks amazing...she fares way better at this than being a comedian...two stars for two breasts well made and well played...the rest is over done schlock...i also think the names of the characters were demeaning to italians...but in comedy you can get away with anything in the name of good film work...you wish","This screen gem from director Jonathan Demme is definitely worth a look for those of you who may have missed it the first time around. Long before she started performing atop pianos; cracking bullwhips dressed all in leather or teaching dangerous minds Michelle Pfeiffer played Angela DeMarco. Complete with big hair, hoop earrings and a Long Island accent. Seems poor Angela wants out of her marriage to Frankie DeMarco (Alec Baldwin). But even when he gets knocked permanantly out of the picture by Mob Boss Tony Russo(Dean Stockwell) her problems are just starting. It seems Mr Russo has a \"thing\" for Angela. He also has an insanely jealous wife(Mercedes Rhuel). On the other hand is a nice nerdish FBI agent(Matthew Modine) who just happens to be investigating Angela for possible involvment in her husband's death. All this and trying to find a job and raise her son. Director Demme manages to perfectly combine humor and menace. Michelle Pfeiffer shines in the lead role and is matched step by step from the supporting cast. Catch this one if you can.","If you're looking for a not-so-serious mob movie, with a female as the lead, you're in the right place. Pfieffer has acted much better than this. You can see she has matured beyond this picture.When I first picked this movie up, I expected Pfeiffer was poorly miscast, however,  she plays her mob wife role to the hilt. Not a bad performance from Baldwin, either.If you don't pay attention to the hair, you might enjoy this movie. But don't take it too seriously...","A recently widowed mafia wife seeks a fresh start, but must deal with romantic overtures from a mob boss as well as an undercover FBI agent who's tailing her. Pfeiffer is wonderful as the woman who can't escape the mob life. Also good is Stockwell as the mob boss who makes the move on Pfeiffer. Modine, however, is miscast as an FBI agent on the case. The role calls for charm, but Modine is so geeky and awkward that it's hard to believe that Pfeiffer would fall for him. Baldwin, who plays Pfeiffer's husband, would have fared better in the Modine role. The supporting cast features a number of familiar faces. Demme provides the breezy direction.","In my attempts to catch up with films I did not see during their original theatrical release, I have reached the point of viewing \"Married to the Mob\", a film that I have heard about, but have never seen until to-day, some 22 years post-release. Was in no hurry to see it, and did not know what to expect. On the VHS cover it was called \"...Godfather on laughing gas\"...by one reviewer. Well, it was hardly that intense. The comedy in this film is rather subtle for the most part...because this film is not necessarily populated by comedians. But...I was pleasantly surprised. Michelle Pfeiffer gave a pretty good performance as a vulnerable mob wife who is, very deep inside, a decent caring person. Her husband is whacked by a mob boss, who immediately begins to make moves on Pfeiffer, despite the fact that he is married. His wife is a jealous, insecure basket case who would rather see him dead than see him with another woman. Pfeiffer moves away and tries to start all over...but to not much avail. But she does not know that the mob boss is the target of the FBI and other agencies who want to nail him...and at first they wanted to also nail her, until she unknowingly falls for one of the agents who discovers the truth about her innocence. The film has its moments, and I guess there are some funny moments in this piece of celluloid, but not enough to really qualify it as a \"comedy\". No side-splitting humor, just funny characters and situations that are not fully taken advantage of. Pfeiffer's portrayal is one of the reasons to watch the film...and the jealous wife of the mob boss has to be seen to be believed. Not a bad flick overall, and I did not think I was going to like it at all. But I did like it...mind you, I said \"Like\"...not \"Love\". It is a worthwhile watch...and you don't need to be \"Married to the Mob\" to have a little fun...thank goodness it has not come to that just yet."],"review-user":["littlemartinarocena","ccthemovieman-1","LMorland","siberryfan","Snoopymichele","fletch5","fldelk-1","claudio_carvalho","TooShortforThatGesture","karen-128","jwpeel-1","nini_ten","eddiespn","mr_white692","edwagreen","Newsense","drealynnb","mhasheider","ferbs54","RoseNylan","sandcrab277","elcardfan86244","Ms H","kenjha","tmpj"],"review-date":["27 August 2009","27 January 2007","15 April 2002","15 September 2004","23 July 2006","21 January 2002","19 June 2006","7 September 2015","4 April 2003","25 June 2001","29 October 2005","2 August 2004","5 January 2016","25 March 2012","7 April 2011","11 January 2009","1 August 2005","10 February 2003","29 November 2007","2 January 2009","28 April 2018","1 May 2002","22 February 1999","26 December 2012","13 August 2010"],"review-rating":["8","8","8","7","10","7","8","6","7","6","4","8","10","8","8","8","4","2","7","7","5"],"review-title":[" Revisiting the Mob\n"," Mob-Comedy Classic Always Entertains\n"," One of the funniest films I've ever seen!\n"," Still on my list of all-time favorites, after all these years!\n"," Great fun!\n"," Amusing\n"," This movie is delightful: It's a hoot\n"," Second Chance\n"," Guys!
