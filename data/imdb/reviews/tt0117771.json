{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117771/reviews"],"review-text":["This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is about true love and friendship. About turning your life around and doing something good for someone else. Thomas Bo Larsen may play the same role he has done in so many other movies, but recently we have seen him in other roles which he does great too. But so what if he plays the same role that he has done in other movies  he's perfect for that role. Ulrich Thomsen does a great job too. These two criminal \"low-lifes\" are the best friends ever. They share everything and they do everything for each other no matter what the costs are. When they find out that Peter's daughter is being abused they put everything on hold (things you can't put on hold unless you have to make even more criminal acts) and takes her to a better place. They do the best they can  these two men are not masterminds but they have their heart in the right place. All I can say is that Peter and Carsten are my Biggest Heroes too","It's all there: Two classic anti-hero buddies, a headlong chase through beautiful swedish scenery, guns, violence, sex, and a Butch Cassidy / sundance Kid - style finale.Add a touch of surrealism and some distinctly danish humour, and you've got this excellent road-movie.","This must be one of the funniest Danish movies ever made.  Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are hilarious, as they drive across Sweden.  I don't know how Ulrich Thomsen does it, but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way. BUT if you don't understand Danish (I am not referring to your pastry here) don't waste your time on this  I don't think it would work with subtitles.","The biggest heroes, is one of the greatest movies ever. A good story, great actors and a brilliant ending is what makes this film the jumping start of the director Thomas Vinterberg's great carrier.","Thomas Vinterbergs \"De Største Helte\" is yet another road movie without the most important element of a film: a good story. The characters are not very original and not particularly interesting. Especially Thomas Bo Larsen is a pain in the neck, playing the same role he has played in the past few years and which he repeated in \"Festen\" - it seems as if he thinks acting = being angry and screaming at other people! The film doesn't make much too sense and isn't very funny either - although it tries hard to be \"kooky\" and \"weird\". If you're going to make a road movie, why not add something original to the genre?!"],"review-user":["cyberraga","alex_kj","mhol","jeppemh","ads-12"],"review-date":["26 October 2005","5 July 1999","10 December 1998","12 December 2000","30 April 1999"],"review-rating":["10","9","9","9","1"],"review-title":[" A movie that makes you feel good...\n"," Classic road-move, scandinavian style\n"," Danish fun\n"," The Biggest Heroes\n"," Lacks a good story\n"]}
