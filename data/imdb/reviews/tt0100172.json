{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100172/reviews"],"review-text":["When his elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.Although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!), as well as a touching study of the close bond between mother and son: Clay's devotion to his mother leads him to abandon all of his other responsibilities, including his job and his relationship with pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough), whilst Emily's love for Clay ultimately drives her to self-destruction.Technically, the film could be sharper, with more stylish direction and better effects (the shots of the creature are kept very brief, so as not to disappoint), and certain more experienced members of the cast frustrate with terribly cheesy performances (Yes, Brion James and Stella Stevens, I AM referring to you); fortunately, however, the strong emotional undercurrent in the well constructed story is enough on its own to ensure that Mom is an effective, compelling, and occasionally shocking tale—one which I have no hesitation in recommending to those looking for something a little different.","Mom should really be given a different title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there called Mom or with the word Mom in the title.This is a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that gets churned out time after time and all end up much the same as every other zombie movie out there.It is so different and refreshing it almost defies categorisation.The kind old lady who takes in a creepy lodger, who just happens to be a flesh eater, who then infects the old lady who also turns into a flesh eating zombie, or ghoul, quite which exactly is not defined.There is pathos in the story as her son realises what she has become and while at first horrified, attempts to help her by supplying 'food'. (I shall say no more about that, for fear of inserting a spoiler!) It is one of those 'quiet' movies as opposed to guns blasting, explosions raging, car chases, etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish, but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans, whilst also inserting sadness into the story, along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some so-called 'horror' movies.There is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film, where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her Christmas tree for company and looks so 'innocent', but, what she becomes!! Oh my! A gem of a movie and even if not your thing, should at least be viewed if only once by any true horror fan.","The first time I viewed the film Mom, I was 12. It was one of the least expected horror films that I thought I would actually like having been raised on the classics of the genre including the 80's slasher and grindhouse fare that I loved. Late one night this film \"Mom\" was coming on Cinemax and I began watching it, wondering how dull and boring it would be. About a couple minutes in, this creepy guy turns into a creature and bites into this woman's stomach. I was like \"Hell Yeah.\" As film goes , A kindly old woman named Emily Dwyer takes in the creepy guy, who by this time is seen as a blind man looking for a room to rent, as the new tennant. The Tennant's name is Nester and he is rarely around during the night, having the need to \"go out to eat.\" As Emily decides to get more familiar with Nester by making him dinner one night, Nester attacks the nice old lady. After that, Emily's son, Clay Dwyer, a nightly Newsreporter, begins to worry about his Mother because he hasn't spoken to her in a few days. He soon comes to find out that Emily has become a flesheating ghoul and Nester is the cause of it all. After killing Nester in a fiery blaze, Clay is left to watch over his Mom, keeping her locked and barred in her room like a prisoner, starving her to the point of madness. Emily eventually escapses and goes on a rampage, killing an undercover cop. When Clay's pregnant wife tries to visit and check on Emily, Emily tries to attack and consume the flesh of her and her unborn child, only to be thwarted by Clay and a few cops. After taking care of the cops by killing and eating part of them, she knocks Clay out a window where he appears to be dead. The motherly instinct takes over and the beastly looking Emily screams into the night a cry of horror because she believes she has killed her son. The climax is the most saddening of any I have ever witnessed in any horror film, this is in part that Emily comes down the stairs, her face covered in blood, crying. She enters the kitchen as Clay comes crawling weakly and painfully through the front door. As Clay prepares to go up the steps, a sudden explosion comes from the kitchen. Clay scrambles for the kitchen where he comes to find the charred body of Emily lying on the floor, who waves an \"it's alright now\" frail and burnt arm as another explosion consumes her body in flames. Clay screams as he watches the exploison take his mother's life. Clay turns to see his wife, who has been untouched by the monstrous Emily, helping him to get out of the house. Then Credits.This film is in a totally different league of it's own. It's fresh and takes the whole zombie/werewolf/vampire tale to a whole new level. It remains one of my favorite horror films because of it's uniqueness. My favorite line in the movie comes when Clay is starving his Mother, who has been locked in her room and hasn't eaten in days. As she claws and bangs on the door, she screams in a guttural demonic voice, \"Let me out of here!!! I'm your Mother,Goddamit!!!!\" I have never seen anything else like it. If you've never seen this monsterpiece, I highly recommend it... it will make you think twice before pissing off your Mom.","Well, I must say, this film is not that bad. There are quiet good moments. Jeanne Bates plays  fantastic, as lovely elderly \"mom\", and\nMark Thomas Miller as her son is even good. There are some gory, gruesome moments, some dramatic, some funny and, yes, also sad...The end is such a sad moment. Mom isn´t an ordinary horror-slasher, I would say, it´s the connection between American Werewolf and Omen.6 of 10 stars","Several memorable double meanings in \"Mom\" are teetering on the edge of \"black comedy\", but there is no further development of the comedy angle. Therefore, I must conclude that this was never intended to be a dark comedy. The horror elements are crude, however the story is memorable for such a low budget film. Brion James has limited screen time, but sets things in motion with a bite to Mom's shoulder. Along the lines of Steve Buscemi in \"Ed and His Dead Mother\", Mark Thomas Miller is torn between his love for his Mom, and the realization that she is addicted to human flesh. Special mention must be made of Stella Stevens performance as a bar trollop, as it is excellent. = MERK","An old lady's boarder Nestor Duvalier(Brion James)turns out to be a cannibalistic monster terrorizing Los Angeles,and promptly turns her into one too.It's up to her son to stop the carnage.\"Mom\" is a perfect flick for few laughs.There is a good amount of gore,but if you're searching for suspense-packed horror avoid this one at all costs.All in all \"Mom\" is worth checking out for some undemanding horror fans,so if you get the chance watch it.My rating:5 out of 10.","All of a sudden everybody's Roger Ebert.People who gave this film a bad review missed the whole point.This is NOT a slasher/gore-fest like they've been making since \"Friday the 13th\" entered the landscape and ruined almost all horror films ever since. It is a throwback to subtle horror films with emotional resonance and fleshed-out (sorry for the pun) characters. True, no back-story is given, so the origin of Nestor Duvalier is unknown.But the film is played straight (this is not a horror-comedy, as some reviewers have insisted) and the tone is set early in the film, a story of how a family is thrown into turmoil by the unlucky intrusion of a monster.Jeanne Bates is totally sympathetic as Emily Dwyer, a woman who lives alone, is somewhat neglected by her kids, and wants not only some extra cash, but some companionship. She shows she's worse at picking tenants than Matthew Modine and Melanie Griffith in \"Pacific Heights\"!!! The rest of the cast acquits themselves very nicely, this is not Shakespeare, it's a low-budget fright flick. And as such, it delivers 90 minutes of old-fashioned fright fun.","Mom has to be one of the all time uncomfortable movies to watch. It features an elderly lady you would love to have as your Nanny who becomes the nastiest mother f***ing monster you would ever want to meet on a dark night!This supper Nanny eats the inners of a young lady at the opening of the movie and it just gets sicker as it goes on. A cross between the howling and brain dead seem to come to mind when describing Mom!A must for horror fans who have the stomach for it (if you have watched re-animator or brain dead, this will float your boat)and are willing to switch the brain off for an hour or so...Let the gore pour!...8/10","This is one of the most unique among horror movies I've watched for the past several weeks. A man accepts becoming a border at a sweet old lady's home but he's not quite the normal border she assumes he is. Next thing you know, she has some unusual appetites...I'll stop there and just say this was thrilling, touching, and, when Stella Stevens shows up as a hooker named Beverly Hills, occasionally funny as Hell! All I'll say now is I highly recommend Mom!","Mom begins at night in the middle of nowhere, at what looks like a wooden building in the desert. A pick-up truck pulls up & an angry Father chucks his slutty daughter Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) out & leaves her there, but she isn't alone as the shadowy figure of Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) watches her from a short distance. Virginia tries to make conversation but as she grinds a cigarette out under her Leopard print, thigh high, high heeled boots Nestor grabs her by her throat & drags her off into the darkness. Nestor then rips her top open, turns into a monster & starts to eat her innards. Virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that have Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) & the LAPD baffled, or at least that's the message a local TV news reporter named Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas MIller) is telling his viewers. Clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough) & therefore his Mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the 'blind' dark sunglass wearing Nestor. Unfortunately for Emily she accidentally knocks Nestor's sunglasses off which reveal he has strange coloured eyes, Nestor then turns into a monster again & bites Emily turning her into a flesh-eating monster just like himself. Nestor takes Emily out to train her, they find a suitable homeless bum (Rory VanSaint), murder him & eat his guts but Emily's son Clay has witnessed the whole thing & he must choose between doing what is right & his love for his Mother who now just happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking & flesh-eating monster!Edited, written & directed by Patrick Rand I thought Mom was a pretty awful film. Looking at some of the other comments on the IMDb & the genre listing it has been given it appears many seem to think that Mom is a comedy horror. Well I can tell you now that I didn't see any comedic elements in Mom at all because there aren't any, unless they are very subtle. The only thing that I can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation which Mom presents, that being an old lady turning into a flesh-eating monster & the predictable problems & emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out. There are no jokes (apart from naming a prostitute Beverly Hills (Stella Stevens)), slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself & as far as I could see it is played totally straight throughout it's 90 minute run time. So with there being no comedy in Mom that must mean there's lots of horror right? Wrong, Mom sucks & is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of Nestor turning into a monster a couple of times, biting Emily, showing her how to hunt for food & Clay finding out. Until this point Mom was moving at a fairly decent pace, had some OK special make-up effects & had me interested, unfortunately Mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by Emily's Son, the eventual breakdown of his marriage & him being torn between love for his Mother & the fact that she's a flesh-eating monster. This part of the film is incredibly slow, boring & as dull as dishwater even having the nerve to resort to a clichéd role-reversal scenario where Clay tells his Mom to go to her room & stay there locking the door behind her, telling her off & putting bars over her window so she can't escape her room. Mom's script totally ignores the monsters origins & ask's us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should, no matter how silly an explanation might have been I think some background to the monster would have helped. Technically Mom is bland & cheap looking, although I can't say it's badly made it's very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or anything with which I could make fun of to pass the time. The special make-up effect's on the monster are OK but their used in very quick flashes, blink & you'll miss them. Don't be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like I was, the monster is only in it three times maximum & all of those are within the pacey first thirty minutes. There isn't much gore either, a severed arm, some brief intestine eating, a burnt body & a drill in someone's arm is all we get. The acting is OK but please Mr. Brion James what is that dodgy accent all about!? At least James had the good sense to know he was in crap & sensibly opted to be killed off early on in the proceedings, everyone else are nobodies expect the black Lieutenant who was also a black police officer in Fright Night (1985) but you may recognise him from Die Hard 2 (1990), he made Mom & Die Hard 2 in the same year?! Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Overall there is nothing by which I can really recommend Mom as a horror film & it certainly isn't a comedy as far as I'm concerned. Very poor, very disappointing & yet again I've been conned by fancy video-box artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters. Definitely one to avoid.","During a time when the city of Los Angeles is terrorised by animal attack style murders, a kindly elderly lady provides a nomad with room and board. It turns out that he is a werewolf and is responsible for the recent killings. He bites the elderly woman, turning her into a werewolf. Now her son must try to prevent the both of them from doing any more harm.There are elements to this film that really hint to the Little Red Riding Hood legend, and it makes such a pigs ear of it, by trying to be clever and reversing it, it's virtually unwatchable.Briton James is the best thing about this film, and if it were a standalone movie about him being a werewolf drifter, it could have been good.Except the film makers thought it would be funny to get an old woman, put contacts in her eyes, and have her hiss every now and again.All the while being chased around by her increasingly annoying son.After James is disposed of, it really hits the one star territory and becomes a horrible mess.Not worth your time, not even worth using your eyes to even read the cover or synopsis. Terrible","Elderly woman provides room and board for a blind musican, but it turns out he is a ghoulish monster who is responsible for a wave of recent murders in the city. He bites dear old mom and she turns into a monster with sudden urges to kill people. As people in the family start to turn up dead, her son must put an end to the carnage. Horror / Comedy where neither the horror works nor the comedy. The humor is flat and the scares are almost none.\nRated R; Violence and Profanity.","I'm 54 and just saw this movie on TV. Never heard of it before. The first scenes looked very low budget so I expected to see one laughable scene after the next. However, the movie and acting started to ramp up after the first zombie gets burned to hell. Thomas, playing the son, portrays a believable son distraught over his mother's sudden transformation into a flesh eating zombie. What we have then is a little old sweet lady with an insatiable craving for human flesh. The attack scenes are incredibly funny. Some of the dialogue is funny, but the last scene of the mother dying is sad. Overall, this was a low budget comedy/horror movie with a twist(old lady's the villain), featuring some good acting and a lot of angst from a son who is torn between the love for his mom and horror of what she does.","Oddball horror/comedy about a sweet grey haired mother who is bitten by a werewolf or some sort of creature of the night (played by the always great Brion James) and transforms her into a bloodthirsty creature of the night, much to the consternation of her yuppie adult son who only wants to help her and stop her from killing. The film really grabbed me with the opening of Brion James as a blind man attacking a prostitute played by Claudia Christian. James then goes on to ingratiate himself to the titular mother who invites him into her home, only for him to attack her and turn her into a werewolf. The dark humor around a sweet old lady with blood dripping down her matronly house dresses is pretty funny and does go a long way, but the rest of the film isn't all that clever or interesting. Art Evans and Stella Stevens also appear in the film, but horror/comedies rarely seem to work and outside of seeing a kindly old lady viciously killing, there ins't a lot to recommend here."],"review-user":["BA_Harrison","artilevel","godofthunder2099","clemensottawa30","merklekranz","HumanoidOfFlesh","musicman37","roy-nicholas33","tavm","poolandrews","FlashCallahan","brandonsites1981","ohlabtechguy","a_chinn"],"review-date":["9 November 2009","28 September 2007","30 July 2010","11 April 2004","7 February 2012","6 May 2003","9 September 2011","6 November 2004","25 July 2018","21 June 2005","10 November 2012","21 August 2002","30 October 2014","22 May 2017"],"review-rating":["7","10","9","6","5","10","8","8","2","1","6","4"],"review-title":[" Poor Clay has the mother of all problems.\n"," A superior and very different zombie movie.\n"," MOM is truly a great American horror movie.\n"," Quiet good\n"," Son, could you go get your Mother something to eat?\n"," Pretty enjoyable horror/comedy.\n"," A good old-fashioned horror flick.\n"," Hot Entrails for tea!*some spoiler* Cert 18\n"," Mom is one of the more enjoyable of unique horror films I've had the occasion to watch\n"," \"Your MOM knows best!\" Rubbishy low budget horror film, don't waste your time.\n"," Only watch it for James....\n"," * out of 4.\n"," Not bad for a low budget horror movie\n"," Horror/comedy almost works\n"]}
