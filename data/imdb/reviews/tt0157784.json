{"review-url":["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157784/reviews"],"review-text":["Sure the audio and the special effects are not there, but this movie is as raw as it gets.  The characters are a bit extreme and the acting is not good, but this is a movie for gangstas from the streets.\nAfter watching a movie like this, I just want to go out and pull a caper or hit the 'crilla'.  The themes are very intense and if you're going to watch this movie, be ready to see what life in the streets are like.  Life in New Orleans ain't no joke and this movie will show that.  I definitely enjoyed watching the music videos that accompanied the movie.  The soundtrack that was associated with the movie was very fitting too.  Watch it at your own risk.","It gives me great joy to have acquired this movie.  This is one of the best movies I own, and I hope the guy I borrowed it from does not come over and remember I still have his tape!  But don't get me wrong, this could be the worst acting I've seen to date and the plot was...well...HORRID, but that is the beauty of it.  To enjoy this movie it must be viewed solely for it's unintentional humor.  It's so bad you will literally be entertained looking for those shining moments, my personal favorites are any scenes with Silk the shocker's attempts at acting. I recommend watching this with a friend, so the laughter came be shared and ya'll can team up to crack on noteworthy scenes.  I haven't seen all of Master P's movies, but I highly recommend his \"Last Don\" movie if you enjoy \"I'm Bout it\" like I do.","This movie was marketed extremely well.  When it was released in '97, during the middle of Master P's fame and success anything and everything with his name on it was selling off the shelves.  That's why it's no wonder this underground urban drama sold over 250,000 copies and still goin'.If you are a fan of No Limit back then or even now check it out.  It has a few old school phatty videos and don't get me started with the freaky deaky strippers at the bonus Ice Cream Party. So what I got to say to all the people who don't like Master P or No Limit Records don't watch it because it isn't for you and don't bother voting on it because you're only going to deter TRU no limit fans from renting or purchasing this video with your low votes.","I'm Bout It is a rare black film, that's so bad it's good. The acting is horrible, camera angles and cinematography are all done with a home camera and the script doesn't flow. I mean you can't help but laugh when a man is tied up and sweaty, replies to his captors by saying f**k you, like he's gonna do something. Watch this film with boys, I guarantee it'll cheer you up.","I love this movie. It is the first film Master P have ever done. It is based on the story of his life. It is low-budget, but it is very good. It shows how Master p grew up in projects in New Orleans.Not only did Master P start in this movie, he also was the writer and director with Moon Jones. The DVD also has The No Limit ice cream party on it. This movie shows how Master P goes from bad too good and how he had to deal with the things around him. It also has many of The No Limit Records roster in this film. You should buy or rent this film.It is a great movie to watch is you like rap, or is a Master P fan. I will not spoil this movie for you. Go get this movie as fast as you can and watch it. You will like it.","This is one of the most influential films ever made. Forget the script(?), and miscomings.Just enjoy it for what it is......a must own.Started the wave of hiphop straight to video flicks.If you don't get it...then maybe that's the point.","I'M BOUT IT(1997)Developed & published by No Limit Films>>Pros: Absolutely none>>Cons: I don't even know where to begin!Plot summary: Master P plays a drug dealer that looks, talks, and acts more like a live-action cartoon character.  That's all the plot I got out of this movie.Review: I remember back when I was in the ninth grade during its release and everyone in my class praised this clown called Master P. This movie is so bad, it's not even funny.  All the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes, the audio is only audible when music plays, and the movie looks like it was videotaped off a public access channel.  Luckily, I didn't buy this film like all my other inner-city degenerate classmates.My rating:1 out of 10My verdict:  Avoid this video like its a sexually-transmitted disease.","This is cleary the best No Limit film. Granted it's low budget but it's on a so bad it's good level. The acting is some of the best from ghetto theater. The simple plot is the vain of Scarface. Look for some classic ghetto lines too.","I bought this video tape. I like it and it's much better than the b-movies that get a lot of sales because certain \"fair\" skinned people have enough sense to support their own. They also come here to pan it so it gets even less viewership. Even our own people can't seem to comment on it w/o mentioning trash like, \"poor acting\", etc. Nothing about this film is bad. This is a good movie, very good, all things considered, meaning these persons are not seasoned pros but they pulled off a great movie right out of the gate. This reason alone is why those aforementioned people make it their obligation to criticize it. They hope to, thereby, remove any ambition or inspiration from YOU in doing great things like movie-making."],"review-user":["Furness","jonspain","Big Ed The Assassin","DunnDeeDaGreat","SBoutain","249","Ghost the Lost Soul","smooth-15","dave1x"],"review-date":["24 March 2004","13 October 2002","12 August 2002","19 November 2001","6 June 2005","7 December 2000","26 December 2001","26 September 2000","17 July 2012"],"review-rating":["10","10","1"],"review-title":[" Raw\n"," Ghetto cult classic\n"," Like It Or Not This Movie Made A Huge Impact On Rap Films.\n"," So bad it's good\n"," The movie that started it all!\n"," ghetto classic\n"," Master P is a no-talent soldier\n"," A ghetto classic.\n"," A \"must-see\" movie for any fan of urban drama.\n"]}
