One day, a glib and self-confident man whom Bill has been following confronts him. He's Cobb, a burglar who takes Bill under his wing and shows him how to break and enter. They burgle a woman's flat; Bill gets intrigued with her (photographs are everywhere in her flat). He follows her and chats her up at a bar owned by her ex-boyfriend, a nasty piece of work who killed someone in her living room with a hammer. Soon Bill is volunteering to do her a favor, which involves a break-in. What does the older man know that Bill doesn't?"],"movie-title":["Following (1998)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWZmNzk5M2QtOTM3MC00ZTg1LWJlYWMtMGIxZWVjODUwNTEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UY1200_CR90,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Christopher Nolan.
