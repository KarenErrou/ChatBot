He also tells of his visit to the floating island of Laputa populated by scientists who are so obsessed with reason that they act with no common sense. Finally, he tells of his journey to the land where his disturbing likeness to the bestial Yahoos and his inferiority to the intelligent horses there makes him question the very worth of his humanity."],"movie-title":["Gulliver's Travels (TV Mini-Series 1996â€“ )"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1OTAxMDk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY0ODEyMQ@@._V1_UY1200_CR95,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["With Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, James Fox, Robert Hardy.
