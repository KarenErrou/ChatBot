She rebuffs William, a suitor, because he's insistent on behavior she considers inappropriate: she's a prude. While daydreaming about reliving her life, a white rabbit taps her on the shoulder, and she follows him to Wonderland, where playful animals and people introduce her to her imagination and to pleasure. After encounters with the imperious Queen of Hearts, Alice decides that Wonderland may not be for her, and she longs for William."],"movie-title":["Alice in Wonderland: An X-Rated Musical Fantasy (1976)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2OTMxNDY5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjcxMjE2MQ@@._V1_UY1200_CR111,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Bud Townsend.
