From where and why did they come to disrupt the proceedings? They were filming a series of vignettes in several different genres, including a wild west sequence, a desert war sequence, a Confederate war sequence, and a science fiction sequence. They disagree with much of what is happening around them, and try to figure out how to escape the oppression they feel - symbolized by a big black box in which they are seemingly imprisoned - by the forces around. That oppression is often shown in the form of \"The Big Victor Mature\"."],"movie-title":["Head (1968)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjMxYTIxOTItYzU4ZC00ZjA5LWFmOGUtYjFlMjM2MmEwM2VlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_UY1200_CR85,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Bob Rafelson.
