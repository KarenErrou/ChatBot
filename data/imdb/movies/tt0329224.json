Young daughter Gina's stories about sometimes evil 'fairies' are equally dismissed, but get worse. Self-appointed handyman warns Iver Hagen them for 'things worse than ghosts' and ever scarier things happen. Ma irrationally believes the house bad yet refuses long to have Gina examined by Dr. Werner, who has a patient Olive obsessed by similar trolls. By the time the pieces are fitted, it may be too late."],"movie-title":["Inhabited (Video 2003)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzcyNjk3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM3MjYyMQ@@._V1_UY1200_CR153,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Kelly Sandefur.
