They are apolitical; a neighbor sometimes gives them a fish; wine is a luxury. They love each other, but there are problems: the war upsets Jan, he is weepy, too sensitive; Eva wants children, he does not. The war suddenly arrives: rebels attack, neighbors die. When the other side restores order, Jan and Eva are arrested as collaborators. After frightening and roughing them up, the local colonel releases them; then he begins appearing at their farmhouse: to talk or to pursue Eva? He gives her money. The rebels return; chaos ensues. Jan becomes violent and murderous; they flee. Can they escape? If so, to what?"],"movie-title":["Shame (1968)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDBjZWVkNzAtNDAzNC00Y2JkLWJjNTgtNWNiYjZjZDMwNzQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODQ0OTczOQ@@._V1_UY1200_CR100,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Ingmar Bergman.
