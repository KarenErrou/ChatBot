He is one week away from playing a CD-ROM that will change the lives of his trusted manager, Dexter, and other employees forever when he is suddenly involved in a deadly accident. He quickly discovers that instead of entering Heaven's pearly gates, he is being sent back to Earth to clean up the mess he created. Since he has an absolute dislike for animals, especially dogs, it is quickly decided that he should be returned to Earth as a dog and not just any dog, mind you, but a fluffy white Pomeranian named Quigley. Sweeney, an \"observing\" guardian angel, will accompany him. He is the only person who will actually see the real Archie. Everyone else sees Quigley. He's given two very different assignments. One is to retrieve the CD-ROM before it's played and the other is to help his brother, Woodward, and his family, whom he hasn't talked to in years. Quigley (a very confused Archie) has much to do and little time to do it."],"movie-title":["Quigley (2003)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBiYmE0MzQtMzBhNC00ODI0LWFjNTUtY2ZmMTY4N2RiNWM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkwODUwOTQ@._V1_UY1200_CR80,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by William Byron Hillman.
