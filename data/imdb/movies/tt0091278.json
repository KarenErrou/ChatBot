Doug finds Chappy, an Air Force Colonel who is intrigued by the idea of sending in two fighters piloted by himself and Doug to rescue Doug's father after bombing the MiG base. Their only problems: Borrowing two fighters, getting them from California to the Mediteranean without anyone noticing, and Doug's inability to hit anything unless he has music playing. Then come the minor problems of the state's air defenses."],"movie-title":["Iron Eagle (1986)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGY3MWIzZGYtOTliMy00YzQzLTgwNjgtNjlkYTA2Y2Y5YTVkL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQzNDI3NzY@._V1_UY1200_CR83,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Sidney J.
