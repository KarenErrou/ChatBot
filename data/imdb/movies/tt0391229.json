A woman he's been dating drops him, as does his agent, her brother. James turns down roles in local TV, roles that make him sad. Someone's remaking his favorite movie, \"Marty,\" a role he'd love, but he doesn't even get an audition. He has a minor meltdown when talking at a grade school career day. Things look up when he meets the quirky Beth at an ice cream shop. Can James make a career for himself, move out from mom's, and find someone to eat cheese with? Or is he destined to watch Jackie Gleason and be Marty for the rest of his life?"],"movie-title":["I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With (2006)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5MTM3Mzk0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIyNTI1MQ@@._V1_UY1200_CR91,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Jeff Garlin.
