He lives in a Hotel in Lugano (Switzerland) since almost ten years, spending his days waiting for something we don't know. His life is too rigid, too detached following a flat routine. Titta ignore everyone and probably he has no emotions at all. Basically there is no story. But one day he decided, breaking all his personal rules, to exchange some words with Sofia, the hotel's barmaid. Incredibly all the situation change, emotions, love, mafia, death come back violently into Titta's life."],"movie-title":["The Consequences of Love (2004)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWZkZDRmODUtYjhiNy00N2FkLWIyNzMtNTYzMWEzMDNjOGE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIwNDY4NDI@._V1_UY1200_CR105,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Paolo Sorrentino.
