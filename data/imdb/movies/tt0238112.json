On a remote Greek island, an Italian artillery garrison is established to maintain order. One Italian officer, Captain Corelli, adopts an attitude of mutual co-existence with the Greeks and engages in such activities as music festivals and courting the daughter of a local doctor. In 1943, however, after Italy surrenders to the Allies and changes sides in the war, Captain Corelli must defend the Greek island against a German invasion."],"movie-title":["Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzE5ODcyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQ1NjEyMQ@@._V1_UY1200_CR97,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by John Madden.
