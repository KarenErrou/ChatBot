She is so convincing in her descriptions of her life on the court and how she escaped the communist purge that, after leaving the asylum, she slowly gains followers willing to believe her story. However, the surviving members of the Romanov family who now live in exile are not among them. This skepticism soon turns into mutual animosity."],"movie-title":["Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna (TV Movie 1986)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MTA3MzM1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDEyMDgzMQ@@._V1_UY1200_CR105,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Marvin J.
