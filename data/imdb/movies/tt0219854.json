One night he surprises an intruder (Spencer Breslin), who turns out to be a kid, almost 8 years old. There's something oddly familiar about the chubby lad, whose name is Rusty. The boy's identity sparks a journey into Russ's past that the two of them take - to find the key moment that has defined who Russ is. Two long-suffering women look on with disbelief: Russ's secretary, Janet(Lily Tomlin), and his assistant, the lovely Amy, to whom Rusty takes a shine. What, and who, is at the end of this journey?"],"movie-title":["The Kid (2000)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTYwM2JmNzgtNzVjMi00NzQ4LTk2MDQtOTE4N2U0ODU0YjYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3Njg3MQ@@._V1_UY1200_CR89,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Jon Turteltaub.
