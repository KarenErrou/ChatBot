The story takes place during a normal school day. At precisely 2:37 a tragedy will occur, affecting the lives of a group of students and their teachers. As the story unfolds, the individual stories of the six teenagers are revealed, each with its own explosive significance. An unwanted pregnancy unravels a terrible, dark secret; all is not as it appears for the seemingly confident school football hero; an outcast must deal with everyday taunts from his peers; a beautiful young girl battles an eating disorder; a stellar student constantly struggles to win his parents' approval; while another uses drugs to escape from his own demons."],"movie-title":["2:37 (2006)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTJiY2E4OTctZTc1OC00ZDAzLWE3OTctZWQzNDNjZTcwM2VkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQ5MzY0NjM@._V1_UY1200_CR108,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Murali K.
