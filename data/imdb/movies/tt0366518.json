She pushes him to reveal the truth about the brutal murder of his mother, but Don instead warns her of danger looming in the outside world, including a mysterious and threatening man named Malachi. Don pleads with her to break him out of the hospital in order to bring the truth to the surface. But the student dismisses his claims as paranoia... until someone begins to follow her every step. Soon Don's delusions become her reality, and she must determine what is real and what is merely the rambling of a madman.
