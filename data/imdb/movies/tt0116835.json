Jay Leno and David Letterman were both vying for the position, but Leno's tough manager Helen Kushnick got him the spot. In the wake of her 'stepping on the toes' of powerful network executives and 'playing hardball' tactics with guest bookings, she found herself being pushed out of her job as Tonight Show Executive Producer and Jay's manager. Letterman, devastated by his being passed over, brought in superagent Mike Ovitz to negotiate on his behalf, resulting in his move to CBS."],"movie-title":["The Late Shift (TV Movie 1996)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzOTI4OTY4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ5NDgyMQ@@._V1_UY1200_CR99,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Betty Thomas.
