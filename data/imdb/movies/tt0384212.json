The seventeen-year-old Evie Brighton loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily. Their father Harry Brighton, a bank investor, lives in the basement with his models of trains and railroads. Evie mysteriously sabotages her interviews for different universities being rejected, and teaches the poetries of her own to Emily. When Martha hears Emily repeating the poems, she takes notes and shows them to the English teacher Stewart Worthy, who believes that Emily has had a moment of genius. When Evie's only friend James reads the notes, he immediately discloses the truth about the author of the poetries. But when Martha becomes aware, she finds the reality of Evie, triggering a series of revelations."],"movie-title":["Admissions (2004)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NzgzODMyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg4MTkyMQ@@._V1_UY1200_CR123,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Melissa Painter.
