Once they're wearing it, they adopt black dialect and fully inhabit their new characters. They crash into the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft. Before reaching land, they suffer the advances of an over-affectionate octopus and more serious danger from sharks, a swordfish and a whale. Once on land, they're frightened by fantastic creatures, and duck into a cave. Inside it's even worse when they encounter living skeletons in blackface. And upon exiting the cave, things are even worse than that when they are discovered by cannibals."],"movie-title":["Plane Dumb (1932)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTczZGZlN2UtZjM5NS00OWVkLWEyMDktNGYxOTI3MTU0MTIwL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjE5MjUyOTM@._V1_UY1200_CR85,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by John Foster, George Rufle.
