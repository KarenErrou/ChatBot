Wine makers worldwide, many using Rolland as a consultant, pursue this structure, color, and taste - to the detriment, argue some, of wine that should reflect the character of the land where the grape is grown, including the lighter Burgundy. A few old wine makers, from Aniane, Sardinia, and Argentina offer this argument."],"movie-title":["Mondovino (2004)"],"movie-image":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3NzQ3NDI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQyNjgyMQ@@._V1_UY1200_CR88,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg"],"movie-short-description":["Directed by Jonathan Nossiter.
